SOM,27,1972,"mr. president, my foreign secretary had hoped to have been able to address the general assembly on behalf of the somali government, but, together with our head of state, he has been engaged in a very urgent peace-making mission on behalf of the oau. since the mission is in its final stage and requires his presence in east africa, he has asked me to undertake this task. 193. he has asked me to convey to you his most sincere congratulations on your accession to the office of president of the general assembly an honor which you have justly earned and which does credit to your great country. 194. the principles and practical considerations which direct the government of the somali democratic republic in its international relations have often been described in this assembly and can be summed up as a firm belief that the structure of world peace must be built, brick by brick, on the foundations of the charter and within the walls of the united nations. in the' past we have sometimes expressed great confidence in the ability of the world body to fulfill its mission to preserve international peace, and we have sometimes been deeply pessimistic about the viability of the united nations. after 12 years of membership and, i believe, of fruitful involvement in international affairs, we realize that neither unrestrained enthusiasm nor undue pessimism are called for. the united nations, like all living organisms, has strengths and weaknesses. the important thing is that it is alive. the important task for all of us is to ensure that it continues to have vigorous life. for there is no alternative besides chaos to the attempt to build up effective systems of international morality, international law and international government. as the secretary-general has emphasized, the nations of the world cannot return to old theories of the balance of power that served different times and different conditions. 195. in a world situation dominated by the confrontation of opposing ideologies, by the gap between rich and developing nations, and by the threat of nuclear warfare, it would be folly to suppose that international affairs can be left entirely to the direction of the powerful few or to the unfettered play of national self-interest. and yet, the deterioration of long-standing problems which threaten international peace, and many of the events of the past year show that, however much the ideal of an international system is accepted in principle, in practice that ideal counts for little. we have allowed international political theory to outstrip international political action. 196. this is why, in the opinion of my delegation, the most important of the continuing items on the agenda of the general assembly is the debate on the implementation of the declaration on the strengthening of international security [item 35]. that declaration [resolution 2734 (xxv)] is a blueprint for the practical application of the doctrine of collective responsibility for international peace. it contains the guidelines for action on every major question that comes within the purview of the world organization. 197. the declaration was warmly welcomed by the group of non-aligned states, of which somalia is a member, because it stands squarely for the authority of the charter and the authority of the principal organs of the united nations; because it seeks to devise rules of behavior which will eliminate the use of force in international relations; because it adds a new element to the call for general and complete disarmament by underlining the connexion be-tween the annual world expenditure on armaments and the increasing gap between the rich and the developing nations; and because it condemns the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms caused by colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination. it is in the light of the principles enunciated in the declaration that my government will state its views on those international issues which are the concern of all member states. 198. my government firmly believes that one of the strongest supports of the structure of international peace which the world organization is attempting to build is the expanding role of regional organizations. the oau is engaged in the constructive task of trying to eliminate regional conflicts, of strengthening regional ties and developing regional co-operation. in recent weeks this has been clearly demonstrated in the dispute between gabon and equatorial guinea, and the serious situation that developed between uganda and the united republic of tanzania. in the case of the former dispute much credit must go to the distinguished heads of state of the people's republic of the congo and of zaire for proffering their good offices and to the governments of gabon and equatorial guinea for accepting them. the positive response of the ugandan and tanzanian governments to the peace efforts of my own government, acting on behalf of the oau, has arrested a potentially dangerous situation and holds a great promise of restoring understanding and peaceful relations between two states which have always had a unique history of friend-ship. 199. one area in which international action lags sadly behind international political philosophy is the area of human rights, particularly as this concept applies to the oppressed people of southern africa. the southern african brand of racism has been condemned by the overwhelming majority of member states as an affront to human dignity and a crime against the conscience of the world. and yet, racism and colonialism outside of southern africa join hands with the racism and colonialism of the minority regimes to ensure that white privilege will be maintained at the expense of the basic human rights of the non-white people. the racism that is open and unashamed within southern africa exists under cover among the allies and trading partners of the white minority regimes. inside and outside of southern africa, neo-colonialism either feeds directly on the life blood of the native majority or supports the systems which so unjustly oppress that majority. racism, expressed as the ties of kith and kin, and neo-colonialism in the form of quick returns on investments based on slave labour these are the factors which outweigh considerations of human rights and of criminal injustice. these are the reasons why those members of the international community which are most capable of taking effective action in support of united nations objectives for southern africa withhold their support. 200. the charge of moral bankruptcy can indeed be leveled at the united nations for its failure to deal with southern african problems which not only involve human rights but which constitute a threat to international peace and security. it is a sign of moral bankruptcy when the united nations campaign to eliminate apartheid is weahned by the non-compliance of powerful member states with relevant resolutions, not only of the general assembly, but also of the security council; it is moral bankruptcy when the rebel regime of rhodesia is encouraged, by overt and covert sanctions-breaking, to intensify the application of apartheid policies to the african people of that territory; it is moral bankruptcy when portugal, a country waging major colonial wars against liberation forces in all the african territories under its control, is given massive financial and military support by its nato partners; it is moral bankruptcy when the giant corporations of certain western powers, with the help and complicity in some cases of their governments, join hands with the south african authorities in using and profiting from the infamous contract labor system in namibia and elsewhere. 201. the situation in namibia has, of course, the gravest implications for the authority of the united nations because of the special responsibility of the organization for the territory and because of the ruling of the world court on the obligations of states in the present situation. my government has already made it clear that, while it will not oppose any attempt at bringing namibia peacefully to independence, it will always insist that certain basic principles remain unchanged. namibia must be a single, homogeneous state, not one divided and weakened by the imposition of bantustans. the united nations must never relinquish its responsibility for bringing the people of the territory to self-determination and independence and the basis for that independence must be full political equality, the elimination of all racial discrimination and equality of opportunity for all the inhabitants of the territory. 202. the united nations also has a special responsibility for helping the people of southern rhodesia (zimbabwe) to achieve independence on the basis of equal rights for all its people. that responsibility was assumed, at the request of the administering power, when the security council, acting under chapter vii of the charter, imposed by its resolution 253 (1968) economic sanctions against the territory in order to put an end to the illegal regime. it is now seven years since that action was taken, but today the southern rhodesian problem is as far from solution as it ever was. indeed, the steady erosion of justice inside southern rhodesia seems to be matched by the erosion of some member states' sense of moral responsibility towards the territory. now that the unacceptable settlement devised by britain and the rebel regime has been firmly rejected by the african majority, neither britain's responsibility nor the united nations responsibility for the territory has ended. but the recent veto by britain at the 1666th meeting of the security council of an african draft resolution on southern rhodesia reaffirming basic principles of international action, points to a withdrawal from earlier positions which supported the oppressed people of the territory. the fact that britain's friends and allies on the security council abstained in the vote on the draft resolution was a further abrogation and a further retreat from responsibility. 203. the african draft resolution sought first of all to reaffirm the principle of no independence without majority rule. this is a principle which is insisted upon by the true leaders of the african majority in southern rhodesia; it is a principle that is supported by the non-aligned group of states and had the full backing of the assembly of heads of state and government of the oau, which met at rabat in july. in addition, it has been overwhelmingly endorsed by the general assembly [resolution 2877 (xxvi)]. i state these facts to show that in vetoing this principle-and member states were given an opportunity to vote on it separatelybritain was opposing the consensus of the world community. it was also, in effect, shrugging off the plea of the african people that it should not abandon them until they are firmly established in a position where they can claim the political and social rights that are their due. 204. the draft resolution also sought to establish, as a basis for a new initiative on southern rhodesia, that there should be a process of democratic consultation with all the people. apart from the logic and the justice of this proposal, its necessity would seem obvious, following the complete failure of the attempt to impose a settlement that had been negotiated without any significant consultation with any of the african sections of the population or their political leaders. this eminently reasonable proposal has been rejected, as well as the call for the administering power to seek ways of according to the people of southern rhodesia such accepted norms of political development as universal adult suffrage, secret ballot and the principle of one man, one vote"". 205. britain's rejection of the principles which must be the basis for any just and lasting settlement of southern rhodesian problems, and the indifference of its allies, come as a shock and a cause of deep disappointment to many states, both in and outside of africa. 206. another disappointing aspect of the rhodesian situation is that the united states will continue to break international law and undermine the authority of the security council by openly violating the sanctions against southern rhodesia which it is pledged to enforce. while the united states is not the only country which has broken sanctions, and its rhodesian imports are a small percentage of the illegal trade with that territory, it cannot be denied that its importations of chrome, nickel and other ores is the result of a deliberate decision of the united states government and sets an example that ill befits a world power. the united states cannot escape its position of world leadership or the responsibilities of that position. 207. the african states have always held that economic sanctions are not the only means of bringing an end to the rebel regime, but they do believe that sanctions are an important measure and that, having been instituted under the authority of the united nations, they must continue to be enforced. it was the firm consensus of the rabat african summit conference that now. more ever, the united nations should keep up the pres.are the illegal regime so that it is forced to struggle for economic survival and to feel the discomforts of isolation. nov/, more than ever, the smith regime should be made aware that its attempts to impose the apartheid system on the african people of southern rhodesia will be opposed by the world community with all the means at its disposal. instead what do we find? we find sanctions widely ignored, even by states which claim to observe them, and the united states justifying its open violations on the unseemly grounds that other powers are equally or more at fault in this matter. 208. obviously we are witnessing in the case of southern rhodesia the same disregard for the authority of the united nations, the same withdrawal from responsibility on the part of those most able to take effective action, the same drift towards support for the racist regime that characterize the other unjust situations in southern africa. my government is convinced, however, that in the course of this session of the general assembly the moral weight of the world community will be directed towards preventing a deterioration of the rhodesian situation and towards reaffirming the commitment of the united nations to the task of seeking justice for the people of that territory. 209. the challenge presented by racism and colonialism in southern africa as a whole has never been greater than at the present time. my government believes that strong emphasis must now be placed on support for the liberation movements of that area. we believe it is necessary for member states to go a step beyond the mere recognition of the legitimacy of the liberation struggle and to take positive measures in support of that struggle. we fully support the mogadishu declaration, adopted by the leaders of east and central african states, which concluded that, since all avenues for a just and peaceful settlement of the problems of southern africa had been rejected by the minority regimes, there was no way left for the liberation of the region except armed struggle. 210. there are many who belittle the role and the motives of the freedom fighters, but this can only be through the bias of racism. the freedom fighters of southern africa are not less justified and not less heroic in their struggle than the members of the european underground who fought their nazi oppressors in the second world war and who are still held up as examples of courage and self-sacrifice in the cause of patriotism. 211. moral leadership in this matter has been given by the world council of churches and by the grass-roots movements of individuals and non-governmental organizations in many of the countries which are southern africa's main trading partners. it is the hope of my government that that example will be widely followed. 212. the problems of southern africa of course loom large in any consideration of colonialism, but it would be unfortunate if these problems were to overshadow completely the problems of smaller territories in other areas which are also still caught up in the struggle for independence. these countries must continue to receive the attention and support of the united nations. in addition to its interests in other colonial situations, my country has made it a cardinal point of its policy to advocate the right of self-determination and independence for the people of french somaliland. this year two important international resolutions supporting the political rights of the people of that country were adopted by the international community. the first was in rabat, in june 1972, when the summit conference of the oau affirmed its support of the right of the people to self-determination and independence and called upon france to create the conditions-as france had done in the past in other colonial territories so that those rights could be freely, equally and fully expressed. the same resolution was subsequently endorsed by the conference of foreign ministers of non-aligned countries during its meeting in georgetown, guyana, two months later. 213. the middle east question, that perennial source of violent conflict, presents another example of how the best efforts of the world community to bring about just settlements can founder on the rock of national intransigence and can be frustrated by the determined refusal of a state to act within the framework of international law that it is pledged to uphold. 214. the retention by israel of arab territory, illegally seized and held since 1967, is a setback to the development of international law; it is a hindrance to the strengthening of international security. the israelis have now publicly admitted what the world has long known, that they initiated the war of june 1967, that theirs was the first surprise attack. even within israel itself there is recognition of the fact that violent conflict with arab neighbors was not inevitable and that the tensions existing then could have been reduced by international diplomacy. armed aggression against other states, forceful and illegal territorial acquisitions, contravention of international agreements on the treatment of occupied territories, defiance of the clearly expressed consensus of the international community and of the security council-these are some of the grave offenses against international law and order that have been committed by israel. 215. but the root-cause of the continuing violence in the middle east over the past 25 years has been israel's refusal to accord to the palestinian refugees their rights, an obligation which was clearly a condition of israel's recognition as a state by the united nations, an obligation which is clearly spell out in numerous resolutions of the general assembly and an obligation whose fulfillment is called for by security council resolution 242(1967). wrongs left unrighted inevitably create an expanding circle of violence and counter-violence. of one thing we can be certain: there will be no peace in the middle east until the wrongs done to the palestinian people have been righted and until arab territory illegally seized by israel has been returned. 216. one of the most distressing failures of the united nations, in the view of my government, and one which was highlighted during the recent 1661st meeting of the security council meeting requested by lebanon, is the increasing unwillingness of some members of the security council to put the cessation of hostilities between states above considerations of national self-interest. the recent use of the veto at the council's 1662nd meeting by a permanent member to kill a resolution which merely called for an end to armed hostilities in the middle east region is a case in point, and the misrepresentation of this issue by the news media in this country did nothing to improve an unfortunate situation. 217. one would think that the primary purpose of the security council would be to try to put a stop to hostilities, particularly when these are being carried out by the armed forces of a state over which that state has direct control. the question of what might have constituted provocation of the hostilities was a separate matter and any member of the council was free to bring that matter before the council. in the view of my government and this view has been expressed on several occasions in the past the use of the veto to inhibit the security council from exercising its primary responsibility for peace-keeping was most deplorable. it was a serious blow to the development of the peace-keeping capacities of the united nations. 218. the world-wide phenomenon of terrorism, which has many aspects, national and international, political and non-political, has become one of general concern, and the secretary-general's initiative requesting that this matter be debated by the general assembly [a/8791 and add.l ] reflects that concern. it is now, of course, widely recognized that this question is a difficult and complex one and that its study must be undertaken with certain important guidelines clearly in view. 219. some of these have been indicated by the secretary-general in his statement in support of his request for a debate on terrorism [a/8791/add.lj, and it is important that they be carefully followed. he has pointed out, for example, that the underlying causes of terrorism cannot be ignored and that a clear distinction must be maintained between terrorism and the struggle of people fighting for their freedom and independence rights that are supported by the charter. 220. it has been asserted by some speakers in this debate that international action against terrorism would obviously not be directed against liberation movements such as those of southern africa. none the less, the need remains for clear-cut safeguards of the rights of those engaged in the struggle for basic human rights and for self-determination. the liberation fighters of southern africa have been labeled ""terrorists"" by the white minority regimes and are considered as such by some of their friends and allies, even though the southern african liberation struggle has been declared legitimate by the united nations. it would be a tragic blow to the cause of freedom and justice in southern africa and elsewhere if the forces of racism and colonialism were to be given an opportunity to cover with an air of legality their harsh suppression of all who oppose their policies. 221. as far as isolated acts of terrorism which involve innocent people are concerned, my government deplores them and holds that they cannot in themselves be condoned. but we do not believe that those acts which are politically motivated can be divorced from their root-causes when those causes include the suffering of long-standing evils which have been recognized by the international community but allowed to continue without hope of redress; when those causes have given rise to struggles that have been recognized as legitimate and when every avenue of peaceful change has been closed to those who seek justice. 222. a few years ago the historian arnold toynbee, on a visit to the united states, said: ""one of the most serious evils in the world today is violence. you have to shoot somebody, burn yourself alive, do something violent in order to get any attention at all, however good your cause or causes, however patient you have been, however well you have put your case. there is an absolute stone wall of indifference all over the world."" 223. my government will consider carefully all proposals that are put forward as part of the world organization's effort to end or contain international terrorism. but it is against this stone wall of indifference to the pleas for justice from the oppressed and the dispossessed that we would like to see the most vigorous efforts of the united nations directed. 224. thegeneral assembly must view this question of terrorism with a sense of historical perspective. while the world organization has a duty to use the peace-keeping machinery at its disposal to deal with all forms of violence, including international terrorism, it must be realized that this phenomenon is not new; it has only been brought closer home because a world which had accepted violence and terror as the natural lot of the poor, the weak and the oppressed, is shocked to see these evils applied to the rich qjid the successful. and where shall we place terrorism in relation to violent conflict as a whole? 225. the difficulties inherent in defining terrorism can be seen if one considers the war in viet-nam. that is an undeclared war; a war in which hundreds of thousands of viet-namese people have been killed or rendered homeless; a war in which a small country has received, at the hands of a great power, twice the destructive force of all the bombing that took place in every theater of the second world war; a war in which the senseless killing, bombing and destruction of human life and national resources go on without any end in sight. and for what purpose? for aims which in their origin were as confused as they were mistaken and which, even if they had ever had any validity, have been rendered completely meaningless by the political developments and events of our times. 226. that is no, just the judgment of one small african state; it is the judgment of the majority of the nations of the world. it is the judgment of the majority of the american people. when we consider the innocent human lives that have been destroyed or damaged by so-called terrorism, let us consider also the innocent millions of the civilian population of viet-nam. 227. the american-made gravel bomb that killed one diplomat was designed to kill, and has killed, countless vietnamese people-civilian and military alike. is it more terrible when one such bomb is delivered by mail than when hundreds are delivered by military aircraft? do the families of those unknown people killed by anti-personnel bombs in viet-nam grieve less for their loved ones than the family of someone with a more exalted status? one would think so, judging by the outcry in one case and the bored acceptance in the other. in the view of my government, the terrorism that is being directed towards the whole vietnamese people is the one that should have the highest priority for concern by the membership of the united nations. 228. another unsatisfactory international situation is the manner in which the united nations continues to be involved in the korean question. my government is disappointed that a viewpoint based on outmoded cold-war concepts has prevailed and has once again succeeded in preventing the long-overdue debate on the korean question. the main reason for the success of the effort to prevent the debate was the misrepresentation of the issue. it was made to appear that such a debate would interfere with the movement towards a detente which is taking place between north and south korea, when nothing could have been further from the case. 229. the algerian proposal [a/8752] -which was supported by my delegation-had as its aim the ""creation of favorable conditions to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of korea"", and was concerned primarily with united nations involvement in that country. it was an effort to complement-not to inhibit or interfere with-the negotiations being carried out between the governments of north and south korea. 230. my government has always maintained that the question of unification and all other internal questions can be decided only by the korean people themselves. this is precisely why we feel that there must be a drastic review of the role of the united nations commission for the unification and rehabitation of korea [uncurk] and why the anomaly of a united states force in south korea under the banner of the united nations should be ended. the incongruity of the continued presence of that force- which is supposed to protect the independence of south korea-is illustrated by the fact that south korea is itself so self-sufficient, militarily speaking, that it has been able to send divisions of troops to viet-nam to oppose the liberation forces of that country. 231. it is factors such as these which hinder the reunification of korea not a consideration of those steps which must be taken to put the united nations in a proper relationship with the korean people. it would have been particularly appropriate if steps had been initiated at the present time when there have not only been talks between red cross officials of the two governments but also when they have taken the important step of declaring the principles on the basis of which they intend to proceed towards unification. it is particularly noteworthy that one of these principles is the desire to avoid all foreign interference or intervention by foreign forces. 232. the normalization of united nations relations with korea by the removal of the forces which remain there in the name of the organization would undoubtedly hasten the process whereby old patterns of hostility would finally be eroded. 233. if the weakness of the united nations is that it has so far made very slow progress in effecting the acceptance of new norms of morality and law in international politics, its strength is that it has been quietly and steadily promoting the concept of global co-operation in other fields. the achievements of such examples of international co-operation and planning as the third session of unctad and the united nations conference on the human environment may have fallen short of the goals set, but they are immensely valuable as exercises in the kind of co-operation that must eventually prevail in our interdependent world. 234. there is an increasing awareness of the fact that we, the nations of the world, are all partners in the business of planetary survival. one of the serious concerns of today which strongly necessitates a global view is the question of population, and my government welcomes the increasing involvement of the united nations in this area. we note also the rapid growth of the united nations fund for population activities and the expansion of its assistance in population matters to over 70 countries. every support should be given to the fund to enable it to respond to all requests from countries embarking upon serious population programs. although not yet supported by the entire united nations membership, the fund has adopted guidelines which we regard as entirely correct in that it grants assistance only at the request of governments and it does not advocate any particular approach to the solution of population problems. 235. it is often repeated that closing the gap between the rich and the developing nations is one of the ways in which international security can be strengthened. while this is yet another area where there is still a wide distance between practice and principle, yet the united nations has set up and continues to devise machinery for closing the economic gap. what is necessary, in economic as in so many political problems, is the will to work for the goals set by the organizationthe will, for example, of the developed countries to implement the decisions taken at the third session of unctad and to increase the scope of those decisions which still do not give the developing countries the equitable trading conditions necessary for economic growth and economic independence. 236. in this same context, my government will give its support to the establishment of a revolving fund for research into, and development of, the natural resources of developing countries. the majority of the third world countries have rejected direct financial aid as a primary source of national development and seek to establish national self-sufficiency. this can best be done by the development of their natural resources. my government hopes that when the question of the revolving fund is discussed in the economic and social council it will be seen in its proper perspective: as part of the process of strengthening international peace and security through the building of economically stable societies. 237. we see that task not only in the perspective of self-interest but also from the point of view that a state must put its own house in order if it is to meet its international obligations successfully. under-developed countries like my own are beset by a multitude of problems, chief among which are the colonial legacies of illogical geographic or ethnic boundaries; economies hobbled by restricted trade and communication patterns; non-existent or sketchily built infrastructures; and alien political and cultural traditions. since independence, most of us have struggled through a period of continued dependence on the aid, methods and cultural impositions of the former colonial powers. as pioneered by the leader of our own revolution, jaalle mohamed siad barre, we in the somali democratic republic are going on now to the development of national pride, to the encouragement of dependence on our own resources and to the arousing in all the people of national identity and purpose. it is my firm belief that this kind of national approach, this kind of reconstruction, is an essential basis for the carrying out of international obligations which all member states of the united nations have assumed. 238. in conclusion, i should like to reject, on behalf of my government, a current view that the political issues which threaten international peace are better reserved for the so-called realities of super-power politics, and that the united nations would do better to confine itself mainly to the social and economic aspects of international co-operation. while most of us, and particularly those of us who are developing countries, have benefited, and continue to benefit, from the work of the united nations agencies, while we are grateful for the campaigns to eradicate malaria and illiteracy, it seems obvious to my government that the surest guarantee for the enjoyment of those benefits is a united nations which is geared to preserve international peace and security, and whose members, large and small, accept the rule of law as set forth in the charter. that document, after all, has shown itself to be a durable and flexible instrument. it is capable of providing the basis for action in all the great issues of our times and of the foreseeable future, whether those issues are regional or global, political or humanitarian, social or scientific. the charter's full potential must be developed to meet the needs of our complex and interdependent world.",Somalia,Africa,5.40465021133423,1.102839946746826,5674.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.5287275290800141
SWZ,31,1976,"mr. president, i wish to express my sincere congratulations to you on your election to the presidency of this historic thirty- first session of the united nations general assembly. with my congratulations i bring the brotherly greetings of his majesty king sobhuza the second, and of the government and the people of the kingdom of swaziland. we have complete confidence that a man of your caliber, who has already proven his leadership qualities and skills as a diplomat, a statesman and, a symbol of his country's commitment to non-alignment, will successfully guide our deliberations. 3. in congratulating you, mr. president, we wish also to express our heartfelt gratitude to the outgoing president, mr. gaston thorn, for the efficient and brilliant leadership which he demonstrated throughout last year's session of this assembly. ' 4. my delegation warmly welcomes the admission of seychelles to an organization founded to harmonize the actions of nations"", 'and is confident that as a non-aligned nation seychelles will always prove a worth-while ally of peace. but peace and harmony in the world can be attained only by harnessing the collective will and co-operation of all nations, large and small. 5. my delegation has confidence, hope and faith that in such an august gathering of peace-loving, peace-seeking and peace-motivated member states substantial progress towards removing the obstacles that lie in the way of freedom, peace, justice, progress and the pursuit of happiness and international understanding can be achieved. 6. i should like to express my country's condolences to the people's republic of china, a member state of our world community, on the death of its great leader, the late chairman mao tsetung. his great achievements are admired and respected by us all. it is now our hope and prayer that the chinese people will continue to prosper in an atmosphere of peace and stability. 7. an unfortunate problem concerning our organization is that some member states do not seem to take it seriously. over the last 30 years we have discussed world peace, justice and progress as pillars of a new generation that should ""learn war no more"", but our world is constantly being racked by war, including local wars, and by division, oppression, poverty, hunger, disease, inflation, unemployment and financial crises. so, at the fifth non-aligned conference, held in colombo, a majority of the nations of the world once again clearly called for a more equitable world order. it is time that call was taken seriously. 8. our experience over the last eight years since we regained our independence has been that every major social or economic problem is also a political problem, and that the central political problem of mankind is how a balanced mixture of economic growth, social justice and democracy can be achieved. 9. it is in that context that his majesty's government has continued to support and to work for the achievement of a new international economic order, in which power and wealth would be more equitably distributed around the world. here we should spare no effort to accelerate the balanced transfer of resources from the developed to the developing world. 10. the past year has taught us that rhetoric is not enough. at present world trade and development is controlled and financed mainly by a small group of privileged countries. the economic fortunes of these nations determine the fortunes of the rest of the world. the past year has been no exception to that rule; growth prospects for the non-oil-producing developing world have worsened, per capita incomes have fallen in real terms, and the gap between rich and poor has widened. 11. it is for those reasons that the government has taken special note of the failure of the dialog between the rich and poor nations in the united nations conference on trade and development [unctadj and in other bodies. concrete results have yet to be achieved, and until such time as the developing world can be united in common action to achieve a common goal, the meetings and talks will have little effect. until such time as it is possible for the developing world to confront the developed world on more nearly equal terms the government of the kingdom of swaziland will continue to work relentlessly for vital reforms of the international economic and financial systems. trade flows must be increased; international purchasing power must be created for the use of the poorer nations; debt must be rescheduled; and schemes must be introduced to stabilize commodity prices. we shall strive to achieve these ends through the years ahead. 12. it is the opinion of my delegation that the third world could normally and more effectively achieve development by the sale of their processed products, in addition to receiving assistance. this would mean that developing countries would increase their exports and rely more on stable and equitable remunerative prices in world markets. it would also mean that collective action would be an indispensable factor in complementing national efforts and bilateral assistance. 13. in this regard natural resources and permanent sovereignty over those resources are considered to be the highest exponents for development, and swazi national participation in the development of industries emphasizes this aspect. 14. since natural resources are not only scarce but also non-renewable, the development of natural resources is based on certain strategies in order to obtain maximum financial and social benefits for the nation. 15. a few weeks ago, when the swazi nation celebrated its eighth anniversary of independence, my head of state said: ""a new and vigorous approach to the problem of peace and war is needed. the time has come when the destiny of mankind should cease to hang so dangerously on the aims and ambitions of great powers."" 16. swaziland believes that if people have no stake in a society they can become a threat to tint society. peace and stability are threatened by divided societies, yet all of us are very much aware that this division continues to introduce into the modern world unnecessary disharmony and conflicts of interest which disastrously divide mankind at a time when unity of purpose and action are so vital for peace, justice, order and progress in the service of man. 17. swaziland's policy remains strongly that of non- racialist democracy, non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, good neighborliness, non-alignment and respect for peace, justice and equality. we practice and cherish these concepts as principles enshrined in both the charter of the united nations and the organization of african unity [oauj. these are principles clearly irreconcilable with any form of denial of the fundamental human rights and degradation of the human person. 18. in this regard my country is greatly distressed and perturbed about the situation across our border in the republic of south africa, where recent events have resulted in the tragic deaths of innocent people including children. 19. we remain more convinced than ever before that racial and discriminatory policies militate against the essential dignity and quality of all human beings, and we hope that efforts to find a peaceful solution to the problem of racial discrimination in south africa will be fruitful. 20. the people of namibia, like any other people, are entitled to self-determination to lead them rapidly to complete independence and majority rule so that justice and human dignity can be the elements of peace in that international territory. 21. at different conferences the ""homeland"" policy of the government of south africa has been a subject of great concern and debate. swaziland remains deeply committed, as it must, to the resolutions of oau and of the united nations on a matter such as this. 22. in april of this year my government, acting as a loyal member of the united nations, fought and won a case in the high court of swaziland in which an effort was made by a south african firm to obtain an order against the government of swaziland and its commissioner of police for the return of a consignment of arms which the south african firm had unsuccessfully tried to import into the republic of south africa by using swaziland as an address. my government took the line that no court of swaziland would issue an order which would result in swaziland's being a party, even if indirectly, to a breach of the arms embargo against south africa imposed by the security council of the united nations. my government has also passed a law known as the prevention of the violation of international obligations order, which imposes heavy penalties against any person who in any manner what-soever, inside or outside swaziland, breaches or is a party to a breach of a resolution adopted by the general assembly or security council of the united nations. 23. speaking from this very podium two years ago, my delegation expressed the view that so long as the privileged white minority in rhodesia was allowed the monopoly of political power it would not voluntarily give it away. 24. it is the desire for peace and justice that we once again observe in the constructive role being played with regard to a peaceful settlement of the rhodesian problem. we have not been proved wrong on the inevitability of majority rule there, and we shall not be wrong in our conviction that it is the authentic people of zimbabwe themselves who must together work out their salvation and shape their destiny in an atmosphere of dedication, unity and reverence. 25. rhodesia must return to legality forthwith. it is with regard to that act that britain is urged to convene a conference on rhodesia to deal with the immediate problems of an interim government and to plan for a constitutional conference. 26. the maintenance of international peace and security is one of the principal aims of the charter. my delegation believes in man's vigorous quest for the common ground of unity and peace. deliberations of this assembly with that ultimate objective in mind will make compromises possible and so prevent the involved member state from transferring problems and disputes from the table of detente to the battlefield of despair. 27. an uneasy calm still reigns over the panorama of the middle east as an attempt to secure lasting peace in the region is being frustrated by intransigence and narrow vested interests. 28. the absence of peace in the middle east means the absence of peace in the world, as the stability of our society is based on reciprocity and interdependence. it is in this spirit that my delegation would like once again to express appreciation and admiration to all the parties concerned in the middle east conflict for showing restraint and human understanding and for seeking a solution through negotiation. it is the view of my delegation that a peaceful solution in that region will continue to demand political will and commitment and can endure only if the principles of justice, territorial integrity, sovereignty and the right of each state to exist are scrupulously observed. 29. in the spirit of non-alignment, my delegation applauds the processes whereby the fabric of national unity is being woven and a pattern of national existence developed, though not with ease, in countries still divided and torn by conflicts. in such circumstances my delegation will not take any action that may be seen to prejudice the fuller development of these objectives. 30. past history reveals that africa has been a continent of drama and tragedy. the scars of slavery, the wounds of imperialism and exploitation are but too fresh to have been forgotten. but the future is different. it is a future of hope; a future of a socio-political evolution towards a larger community of a united africa; a future that will ultimately banish big-power patronage in a continent that is being rebuilt from the ashes of colonialism; a future without the indefensible status quo and white domination; and indeed a future of inspiration that we shall, for certain, triumph at the end of it all and regain our glory as a free continent. 31. it is for these reasons of hope that my country, together with the non-aligned countries of the third world, has consistently demanded the withdrawal of any naval or military presence from the indian ocean by the great powers because we, who rightly regard the indian ocean as being on our doorstep, also regard it as a zone of peace. 32. turning now to the third united nations conference on the law of the sea-a conference which has benefited greatly from your able and wise guidance, mr. president-it is our conviction that members of the international community must eschew narrow national interests and exert the necessary political will to utilize this unique opportunity to establish international norms to regulate 70 . per cent of the earth's surface. we believe that at the last session of that all-important conference there was some progress in ensuring that land-locked states like swaziland were granted the right of access to and from the sea and that, together with other developing, geographically disadvantaged states, they would have the right to exploit the living resources of the economic zones of coastal states in the same region or subregion on an equitable basis. 33. much, however, remains to be achieved at the next crucial session in may 1977. this is especially so with regard to the establishment of an effective international sea-bed authority to give practical effect to the concept of the common heritage of mankind and the establishment of a comprehensive system for the settlement of disputes. compromise and a pragmatic approach are essential if a new convention is to be acceptable as it must be to all segments of the international community. 34. the problems of war and peace are not an adventure. war is our destruction. peace is our salvation. let us strive to create a climate of peace in our world, and not of war. let us build bridges to span the gulfs created by diverse and conflicting interests so that freedom, unity and equality can provide the promise for future prosperity, democracy and justice. let this assembly lay emphasis on deeds rather than mere words deeds that are calculated to further the objectives of a durable peace in our tin.e.",Eswatini,Africa,55.3250389099121,3.714349985122681,2370.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.6877637130801688
RWA,33,1978,"144. the delegation of rwanda wishes to join in the congratulations and praise addressed to you, sir, on your election as president of this assembly. the unanimous confidence shown by our assembly in electing you president of its thirty -third regular session is undoubtedly a well-deserved tribute both to your exceptional personal qualities and to the role that your country has played and continues to play in the international arena in order to bring about a world of freedom, justice and progress. 145. i should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, a distinguished son of the people of yugoslavia, a country which has constantly striven for the attainment of the noble objectives of non-alignment. 146. at this same rostrum at the same time last year, speaking of mr. kurt waldheim, i said: ""my country, rwanda, has always greatly appreciated the efforts and the wisdom shown by our secretary-general in carrying out his very delicate tasks to ensure for the united nations influence and effectiveness in keeping with its mission."" i take particular pleasure in once again expressing my country's great esteem for his tireless efforts to bring about the triumph of the objectives and principles of our organization."" 147. furthermore, we share the joy of the people of solomon islands on this memorable occasion of its admission as a new state member of our organization. the independence of solomon islands is another landmark on the road to the complete elimination of colonialism and foreign domination throughout the world. 148. ""the irresistible march towards the elimination of colonialism and foreign domination should go hand in hand with the fight against the present imbalances in the world, a dominant feature of which is the establishment of a new international economic order. 149. the quest for this new order involves the elimination of poverty, ignorance and sickness, and a reduction of the gap separating the poor nations from the wealthy nations. instead of competing in the production of increasingly sophisticated weapons the wealthy nations should realize that there is a nobler struggle', that for universal social justice. that struggle would be made easier if the funds used for the arms race were diverted to development assistance. indeed, the more than $us 400 billion poured every year into the production of weapons of mass destruction would be sufficient, we think, to enable a start to be made in improving the national economies of all the poor countries. 150. we are convinced that the present crises, both economic, and political, are based on that inequality which certain countries are perpetuating in the service of a policy which is unscrupulous and tied to various forms of hegemony. 151. in this connexion, now that the need for respect for human rights is receiving the greatest attention in the international community, determined effort must be made by the major powers to substitute respect for human dignity for violence and oppression by the wicked regimes of racism and apartheid. 152. the people of namibia, zimbabwe and azania must recover their freedom. our duty, based on concrete solidarity, is to support them by every means, including armed force because peaceful means alone have not made the tyranny of the regimes of pretoria and salisbury more yielding. 153. these two murderous regimes have become infamous in the history of africa and in the history of the world, not only because of what they have done to the black race but also because of their misdeeds against all of africa and mankind as a whole. 154. on the subject of zimbabwe, the peace talks now having failed, the freedom fighters must be encouraged to stand firm. we support the patriotic front, the legitimate representative of zimbabwe, in its determination to lead the country to genuine independence. the other nationalists, who were so anxious to make a deal with the racist rebels, must at last realize that they were deceived by illusory promises, because whatever happens, any genuine negotiations must take account above all of the proposals of the patriotic front. 155. we are fully convinced that, the two bastions of racism will fall before the irresistible march of history sooner or later. their provocation of the front-line states will be to no avail, for the front-line states are determined to continue to help their fighting brothers, supported as they are by the rest of the peoples of africa and by other peoples of the world which cherish peace and freedom. 156. furthermore, as regards namibia, the delegation of rwanda has not lost sight of the fact that the efforts of the western powers members of the security council deserve credit. however, the delaying tactics and the treachery of ian smith and vorster, and in particular the brutal aggression against and the massacres of the peaceful populations of zambia, mozambique and angola cast doubt on their credibility and good faith. it is for them to draw the proper conclusions from these events. 157. africa remains attentive to all these vicissitudes and, to any attempt to undermine its cohesiveness and unity by supporting or encouraging conflicts among the african states and diverting them from their primary concerns. 158. our continent must no longer be a breeding-ground for power struggles encouraged by thinly-disguised neocolonialism. 159. inter-state relations must be based on the principles contained in the charter of the united nations and recalled in the charter of the oau. we must always settle our conflicts by peaceful moans and without foreign interference, whose only aim is to incite africans to blind self-destruction to serve the interests of hegemonistic forces. 160. the aggression perpetrated by israel against the arab nation is of direct concern to the peoples of our continent. the peoples of the middle east belong to two civilizations: african and arab. our bonds with the arab world justify our indignation against: the annexationist policy of israel. 161. this high organ has never ceased to recall that israel must return the occupied arab territories, in accordance with security council resolution 242 (1967), and that the palestinian people must be able to determine its own fate and to exercise its right to self-determination in a regained homeland. 162. my government, in this connexion, supports the efforts of the government of the united states to increase the momentum of the process of achieving a just and lasting peace in the area. we believe that the camp david summit talks may have been a very important step towards that objective. 163. i do not know whether this assembly will have an immediate and adequate reply to the fundamental question of how to put an end to armed conflicts and bring about universal peace, the ultimate goal of our organization. 164. we note that certain conflicts have come to an end but that others have arisen, elsewhere or in the same area, throughout the world. 165. my delegation deplores such conflicts, especially between fraternal neighbouring countries, such as those on the sino-vietnamese and vietnamese-cambodian borders. we regret the exodus which such tensions impose on innocent populations that have fallen victim to intriguer beyond their understanding. 166. another major obstacle to the creation of universal peace is the division of certain nations such as germany, korea, cyprus and a number of others. 167. rwanda has always supported from this rostrum a realistic approach to this probleman approach worthy of rising generations and, hence, of history. the irresistible march towards the unification of divided nations, in accordance with the will of their peoples and without foreign interference, should enjoy the complete support of the international community. 168. together with all these concerns, we believe that the first step for bringing about the universal peace we seek is complete disarmament and the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction. 169 the talks that have begun in this connexion under united nations auspices should be pursued and lead to concrete results. the recent tenth special session, devoted to disarmament, has laid the groundwork for an international conference on disarmament. 170. we are pleased that solution of the problem of disarmament and of halting the arms race is no longer the domain of the super-powers alone but has become the common undertaking of all countries. it is, of course, a question of great concern to all mankind. 171. we have already had occasion to hail france's initiative on this important and timely issue. the proposals if made to the special session deserve special attention, especially since disarmament is related to development. moreover, france's position in this connexion is akin to that of the non-aligned countries, which initiated that session. 172. even though the special session yielded limited results and brought to light very significant differences among states, we believe that its merit is that it made it possible to start the process of disarmament negotiation and identify the demands of mankind. 173. since the sixth special session of the general assembly in april 1974, a problem as old as our organization itself has come to the forefront of the international scene because of its explosive nature and the urgent need to solve it. i am referring to the establishment of a new international economic order. 174. the present economic order, which the international community is trying to change, has become a source of deep concern and bitterness over the years. 175. this unjust system, under which a small number of countries controls mere than 80 per cent of the world's markets, all of its technology and, consequently, nearly all industrial investments, is forcing the developing countries into a state of poverty and misery because of the constant deterioration in the terms of trade and because of the resultant inflation and economic recession. 176. the international community, and in particular the developed countries, must take appropriate action in this connexion to make it possible for the third world to have wider access to the markets of the industrialized countries by providing, not just in resolutions but also in deeds, more equitable outlets for the manufactures of the developing countries. 177. moreover, while it is true that the modern approach to development is closely connected to the problems of energy, it is consequently a matter of urgency that this question, which since the beginning of the north-south dialogue has been a stumbling-block in the negotiations between industrialized and developing countries, be speedily settled in a fair manner. 178. the industrialized countries must therefore take an active and substantial part in the solution of this problem, not resorting to unjustified protectionism but respecting the principle of mutual advantage. that implies, in addition to guarantees of non-discriminatory access to ordinary energy sources, the technology of which they control, but easier access also to nuclear energy. 179. as far as raw materials are concerned, in the world economy they continue to be subject to instability and disquieting price fluctuations, which are at the root of the sudden drops in the export earnings of the developing countries. 180. although the importance and urgency of creating a common stabilization fund for the prices of raw materials require no further proof, they run up against a lack of political will on the part of some developed countries. we are very pleased with the position taken by japan from this rostrum [6th meeting] in support of an equitable solution to this problem. 181. we are equally pleased to note the efforts of some of the developed countries both as regards the setting up of that common fund and increasing their public assistance for development and as regards debt cancellation. 182. the government of the republic of rwanda highly appreciates the commitment of certain industrialized countries, such as the federal republic of germany, to convert into grants development assistance loans which they have steady made or will make in future to the least-developed countries. 183. but this praiseworthy effort, unless shared by the international community as a whole, cannot bring a final solution to the world's economic problems. that is why the united nations must make a major effort to promote true economic and social progress throughout the world. 184. this brief outline of our major international concerns has perhaps not done full justice to the complexity of the many problems which are on the agenda of the thirty-third session of the general assembly of the united nations, but it does nevertheless reflect the present basic realities of international relations. 185. we hope that the desire of the peoples of the world for peace, freedom and social justice will not be eternally thwarted. that, of course, will depend on the good will that each state brings to the implementation of the noble principles of our organization.",Rwanda,Africa,38.2434310913086,2.232470035552979,2105.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.9002375296912113
BDI,34,1979,"a birth in a family is naturally a source of joy and of hope. thus the people of burundi share the legitimate pride of the people of saint lucia on their accession to independence and admission to the great family of the united nations. the entry of saint lucia into the united nations is striking proof of the universality of our organization. the victory of the people of saint lucia is undoubtedly an encouragement to other peoples struggling for their dignity and freedom. 3. in quite different context, let me pay a tribute to the memory of a great african statesman, agostinho neto, champion of the freedom and the real independence of angola and indefatigable defender of peace and dignity in africa and throughout the world. we wish to convey to the angolan people our deepest condolences and our feelings of solidarity and encouragement at this difficult time. 4. ever since its foundation, the united nations has set itself the fundamental task of safeguarding international peace and security, the establishment of justice in the world and the strengthening of the ties of cooperation and solidarity among all the peoples of our planet. the triumph of these ideals calls, first of all, for the establishment of an equitable and democratic system in international relations and the promotion of an order of mutual understanding and respect for human rights and for peoples in their totality. 5. it is within this context that we should view the struggle being waged by the united nations to put an end to injustice in the world and to create conditions for a just and lasting peace so necessary for fruitful cooperation among nations. 6. the work that has been done in this area by the united nations is, in our view, of particular importance. we should therefore like to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the general assembly, which can take pride in having so consistently lived up to the importance of its task and, therefore, constitutes an ideal framework for co-operation, exchange of experience and decision-making. 7. the positive record of the general assembly is due not only to the political maturity and sense of responsibility of the member states, but also to the farsightedness and devotion of the distinguished persons who have so competently discharged the functions of president of this principal organ of our organization. 8. in electing you, sir, as its president, the general assembly not only acted in keeping with its principles and noble traditions. it also wished by design to mark the importance and gravity that it attaches to this session. your extensive experience in international affairs and your commitment to supporting peoples in the struggle for their independence and dignity are guarantees of the success of this session. we take this solemn occasion to extend to you our sincere congratulations on the trust that the general assembly has placed in you. of course, the tribute we pay to you, on behalf of the people and government of burundi, goes also to your country, the united republic of tanzania, whose ties of solidarity with my country, burundi, were forged long ago and have been strengthened at the time of our national liberation struggle. 9. we also wish to extend our sincere gratitude to your predecessor, mr. lie'vano of colombia, for having so masterfully and successfully conducted the proceedings of the thirty-third session of the general assembly. 10. we should also like to extend our greetings to the secretary-general of the united nations, mr. kurt waldheim, whose competence, integrity and devotion in the service of peace and the liberation of peoples have aroused in our breasts sentiments of the most profound admiration and highest esteem. 11. the work he has been doing ever since he has been secretary-general of our organization deserves more than our congratulations and encouragement. we should like to take advantage of our presence here to assure him once again of our confidence and of the total support of the government and people of burundi in his noble task of working unremittingly for the triumph of the fundamental objectives of the united nations charter. 12 for the first time in the history of our country, the head of state of burundi is personally taking part in the work of the general assembly of the united nations. this decision was no accident but a logical consequence of the revolution carried out by the people of burundi on 1 november 1976. that date marks a major turning-point in the history of our country. to understand this, it is sufficient to refer to the period immediately preceding and that immediately following the radical change that took place on that date. to put you in the proper chronological context, let me briefly describe the true history of our country. 13. a mere 17 years have elapsed since our independence, which was gained by dint of tremendous sacrifices by our people and the valuable support rendered by friendly countries and by the united nations. 14. at first sight, burundi is a young state. however, the truth is quite different. indeed, the most critical history books, as well as other most authoritative sources of information, are unanimous in asserting that the state of burundi, cohesive and organized in all sectors of national life, goes back as far as the fifteenth century a.d. the nation of burundi, even at that time, could take pride in its age-old unity, the decisive elements of which remain today. these are, primarily, the will to live together as a people proud and jealous of their national independence and sovereignty, and, secondly, a common national culture and a single national language, kirundi, which is spoken throughout the whole country without a single dialect. 15. all these factors have served to shape the personality of burundi. this was the driving force of the burundi nation, which, under the aegis of the party union pour le progres national [uprona], was successful in the elections organized by the belgian administration and supervised by the united nations on 18 september 1961. this victory was to lead burundi, as we know, to true independence on i july 1962. thus, the unity of the burundi people was once again consecrated. this marked the turning of a page after a period of darkness and humiliation, and there opened up a new era of liberty and co-operation. 16. unfortunately, successive governments in power did not respect the people's verdict. irresponsible citizens allied themselves with external enemies of our country to divide and exploit the united, peaceful and hardworking people, 17. it was therefore necessary to establish state structures in such a way as to make possible and irreversible the creation of a society where national concord and social justice would prevail. for this purpose, power had to be handed over to its true holders, the people. in order to achieve this goal, it was necessary to create conditions which made it possible for the burundi people to embark on a course of national reconstruction. it is within this context that we adopted, from the very outset, a programme of national rehabilitation, the main element of which was national reconciliation. this major concern of our policy underlay all our decisions. all appointments to posts of responsibility and authority were thus inspired solely by the criteria of competence and patriotism. 18. the importance of this policy of national reconciliation did not relegate to a second place the other strategic sectors of national life. thus, the programme of national rehabilitation set as its other immediate objectives the fight against hunger and poverty, ignorance and disease on the one hand and, on the other, the struggle against social injustice and man's exploitation of man. 19. this policy was reflected in the following measures. in the field of agriculture, it was decided first to increase production of consumer goods in general, and of food-stuffs in particular. secondly, it was decided to diversify exports. as far as the rural world was concerned, the government embarked upon a policy of improving and modernizing living conditions, the electrification of important centres in the country, and supplying water to villages and development centres. in the field of education, the government adopted important measures with a view to enabling all burundi citizens without discrimination to go to school and university in the same conditions. this policy of the democratization of education was reflected particularly by the state's assumption of responsibility for all teachers and professors, by the building of school and university infrastructures, by the provision of teaching materials and scientific equipment, and by the granting of scholarships to all students. the sole condition laid down for this was that they be successful in competitions and examinations. 20. with regard to health, the government decided on the development and improvement of infrastructure in this area, while promoting the training and improvement of cadres. 21. these health measures would have been futile if social justice in all its dimensions had not been established. that is why the people's revolution of 1 november 1976 called for the elimination of the vestiges of feudalism. it was in this context that we decided on agrarian and fiscal reform and also on the installation of a sound system of justice, which would be accessible to the people, by the creation of new courts. 22. all these measures were taken in response to the wishes expressed clearly by the people in the course of many consultations which we held from the very first hours of the revolution on 1 november 1976. it is the constant dialogue going on between the people and ourselves which has made it possible for us today to endow with real content the well-known saying ""government of the people, by the people and for the people."" 23. the reorganization of the uprona party, the crucible of national unity, and repository of the independence of our country, has no other goal but that of transferring power to the people through its organizations. 24. out of respect for the profound aspirations of the burundi people, we did everything in our power to ensure that this mass party, membership of which is entirely free, should be in a position to conceive, guide and monitor all political, economic, social and cultural activities in our country. 25. in order to permit the burundi people effectively to exercise its prerogatives of sovereignty, we created the necessary conditions for the party to be able to guide and genuinely to control the executive. in other words, the people run and manage their own affairs in the communes and the provinces. leaders are only kept in their posts to the extent that they enjoy the confidence of the people. 26. thanks to the political maturity of our people, we believe that the time has come to permit it to choose its leaders at all levels. this task is incumbent on the national congress of the uprona party, a meeting of which is scheduled for the end of this year, and this will constitute in practice the consummation of the action already laid down at the level of the communal assemblies and provincial congresses of the renovated uprona party. 27. in the light of the foregoing, we can claim that the state which we are organizing is one which will permit the burundi people to perpetuate their history, to strengthen their age-old unity, to consolidate the victories they have won, to build their democracy and to determine their future in a free and sovereign manner. it is for the people of burundi, in fact, to pronounce on the type of society which will safeguard their identity, while guaranteeing their progress in a world ml of change. 28. this is the role of the national congress of the party, and this is why we quite rightly consider that this session of the party will constitute an event of primary importance in the national life of the burundi people. we were therefore anxious to inform the united nations and the whole international community of this, especially because we in burundi consider that there must exist a certain harmony between internal options and a country's foreign policy. 29. the guiding principles of our country's foreign policy are well known. these are good neighbourliness, positive non-alignment, non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, international co-operation and support for national liberation movements. 30. in the light of those principles which are, for us, inviolable, we propose first of all to deal with subjects relating to the question of decolonization, problems of security in the world, the advent of a new world order and the question of human rights. 31. the emergence of new independent nations is an event of the first importance in international relations in this last quarter of the twentieth century. this phenomenon is explained by the struggle of peoples subjected to colonial domination and by international solidarity. in the course of this irreversible process of liberation, the united nations has played an important role. however, in spite of the impressive volume of resolutions adopted by the general assembly and the security council the work of decolonization is not yet done. 32. we believe that the time has come to tackle the true obstacles to decolonization. 33. in so far as concerns africa, we have come to the conclusion that it is strategic and material interests which put a brake on the liberation of south africa, namibia, zimbabwe and western sahara, 34. in our day africa has, unfortunately, become the proving-ground for rivalry between the great powers. this renewed interest in africa can be explained, first and foremost, by the geographical situation of our continent, which is washed by both the atlantic and indian oceans and the mediterranean sea; secondly, by the disruption of political-military alliances in southern africa following the liberation of mozambique and angola; and, thirdly, by the fact that africa constitutes a vast reservoir of primary commodities and possesses very sizeable resources still unexploited owing to a lack of skilled people and adequate financial resources. 35. those three elements underlie certain policies of power and domination, such as those implied by the establishment of military bases and the presence of warships off the african continent and the policies of aggression continually engaged in by the racist colonial regimes of pretoria and salisbury against angola, mozambique and zambia. it is also those strategic and economic interests which inspire the plans of certain governments for the political and economic destabilization of progressive regimes in africa. 36. conscious of those obstacles in the path of the liberation of african territories still under racist colonial domination, we are convinced that it is our organization's task to take the courageous measures that the situation requires, 37. in the light of the events occurring in southern africa, the united nations must take energetic and bold measures that are called for and made necessary by the requirements of freedom and dignity. in particular we call upon member states which maintain various relations with those racist and colonial regimes in southern africa to review their policy which, in any case, is in quite clear contradiction with their own system of government and their statements in the united nations. at a time of co-operation between states and of interdependence it is incomprehensible that millions of human beings should be sacrificed on the altar of strategic and economic interests, interests that are futile, because sooner or later the peoples of south africa, namibia and zimbabwe will become the true masters of their own countries and resources. history is rich in lessons in this area, 38. it is for this reason that we suggest to the great powers with their interests in southern africa that they turn over a new leaf in their record of co-operation with the racist and colonial regimes of pretoria and salisbury and instead turn towards support for the national liberation movements with a view to preparing for the independence of those countries which are still under colonial domination and laying the foundations for solid co-operation. 39. the example of the intensive co-operation which exists between the independent states of africa and their partners in the western world .should calm the exaggerated apprehensions and unjustified fears of certain countries or certain societies with regard to the maintenance of their interests in southern africa after the liberation of south africa, namibia and zimbabwe. 40. for all those reasons, we believe it is realistic completely to isolate the racist and colonial regimes in southern africa. we therefore urge the security council to make use of the provisions, of chapter vii of the charter to impose economic sanctions on south africa, furthermore, we hope that the economic sanctions decided upon against rhodesia will be strengthened. 41. we, for our part, will continue to support the national liberation movements recognized by the organization of african unity [oau], that is to say, the south west africa people's organization for namibia, the patriotic front for zimbabwe, and the african national congress of south africa and the pan-africanist congress of azania. 42. we should also like to pay a tribute to the frontline countries, whose solidarity with the liberation movements has been the greatest encouragement for all the peoples engaged in the struggle for their survival and dignity. the international community should offer further support to those countries victims of repeated acts of unprovoked aggression by those regimes which have been condemned by history. 43. the situation prevailing in western sahara is the result of a deliberate policy of recolonization, which has been reflected in the invasion, occupation and denial of the identity of the saharan people. the sixteenth ordinary session of the assembly of heads of state and government of the oau, held in monrovia, liberia, in july last, both reaffirmed the inalienable right of the saharan people to self-determination and independence and recognized the need to permit that people to take a free decision about its future. the burundi government has always supported the just cause of the saharan people under the leadership of the frente polisario. we hope that the voice of african wisdom will be heeded by all the parties concerned and that the saharan people will finally become masters of their territory and destiny. then arms will fall silent and a new era of co-operation and peace will dawn in the region. 44. the situation prevailing in the middle east is a matter of the greatest concern to us all. the international community has recently witnessed a major diplomatic offensive which culminated in the signing of the agreements between egypt and israel. some thought that that was an important step towards peace. unfortunately, at the present time peace and security still remain in jeopardy. the palestinian people are still without a country and many other issues still remain unresolvedsuch as israel's withdrawal from all occupied arab territories and the status of jerusalem. 45. a just and lasting solution to the question of the middle east must take account of all those elements the point of convergence of which is the concept of a home- rand and the formation of an independent state. it is in this context that we would encourage any initiative designed to revive peace negotiations among all the parties concerned, including the palestine liberation organization [plo] representing the palestinian people. 46. in the face of increasing tension in the mediterranean we call on those states parties to the conference on security and co-operation in europe to transform the region into a zone of peace and co-operation. 47. also in the context of the maintenance of international peace and security we whole-heartedly support the aims of the declaration of the indian ocean as a zone of peace, which was adopted by the general assembly of the united nations in 1971. we call on all states to review their policies of power, which consist of setting up or maintaining military bases in that area, in order to guarantee the sovereignty, territorial integrity and fruitful development of the region. 48. peace is an indivisible whole. security in africa, europe and the middle east would indeed be precarious if asia, where most of humanity lives, were faced with large-scale conflicts. we have great respect for these peoples with their very old civilizations. africa has ties of active solidarity forged through the history of the liberation of the african and asian countries. 49. we ask all south-east asian states to settle all their conflicts or disputes themselves without outside interference, so as to safeguard world peace in this region. we sincerely hope that, thanks to their own genius, these states will be able to overcome the obstacles to their negotiations, so that the conditions for viable peace and fruitful co-operation in the region may be created. 50. on the question of korea, our government supports the efforts towards the peaceful and independent reunification of that country. so that this goal may be achieved, all foreign troops must be withdrawn and all bases and other foreign military installations in south korea must be dismantled. we would also like to draw the attention of the international community to the untoward effects the admission of a divided korea to the united nations would have. 51. the second world war was enough to demonstrate the drama of mankind's existence threatened by the huge arsenal of destruction made available to human societies through science and technology. therefore it is urgent to do everything possible to avoid anew global conflagration and to discourage any escalation of violence, for the very survival of the human race. the only way to achieve this is to carry out complete and general disarmament. this will only be done by promoting a sense of solidarity and friendship among peoples and by making people aware of the danger represented by the arms race. 52. in these circumstances, only political commitment by states can unleash the disarmament process. the final document of the tenth special session of the general assembly [resolution s-j0i2] represents a stage which should be stressed within this context. it is important that the measures recommended in this document should be followed up. 53. the signing of the agreements reached at the conclusion of the second round of the strategic arms limitation talks [salt] by the united states and the soviet union is another encouraging sign. we hope that the negotiations during the third round of salt will start soon. 54. there is every reason to encourage the initiatives undertaken towards creating nuclear-weapon-free zones. here we consider it imperative to take the appropriate measures for the application of the declaration on the denuclearization of africa, for the creation of zones free of nuclear weapons in the middle east and in south asia, and for the respect of the treaties and protocols banning nuclear weapons in latin america. 55. all these measures are of course only aimed at the establishment of true peace. there is no doubt that this implies stopping the arms race, reducing stocks of conventional weapons and destroying stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. 56. nevertheless, if we want to achieve real peace, we must work towards the universal establishment of an order of justice and equity in international relations. 57. the ever-growing gap between rich and poor countries, the persistence of an unjust international order in die distribution of resources and the maintenance of relations of domination are factors which give rise to serious tension which, in the long term, threaten the establishment of true peace on a global scale. 58. the response to this situation can only be sought through the united nations resolutions relating to the establishment of a new international order based on justice and equity. the advent of a new international order in the field of economic relations and information will be our next subject. 59. in spite of the efforts made at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the general assembly and later at the north-south conference in paris and at sessions of unctad, we have to face the fact that the situation of inequality and injustice is getting worse; hence the need to transform the system of dependence and exploitation into relations of mutual benefit. it should be made clear at once that this struggle for economic liberation by the third-world countries is not directed against the industrialized countries. 60. the claims of the developing countries are in fact those of having the sovereign rights to their own re-sources, the establishment of machinery for stabilizing the prices of primary commodities which they export, the creation of reasonable conditions of access to the international market, the transfer of science and technology to the developing countries, the reform of the international monetary system and finally international co-operation free of any alienation or humiliation. 61. these demands by the third-world countries take real account of the interdependence of nations and the complementary nature of world economies. 62. the full importance of this factor was really felt during the 1973 oil crisis. drastic measures to deal with the root causes of the crisis should have been taken from then on. the industrialized countries did not have the courage to follow this course; hence the almost insurmountable difficulties which all countries must face. however, we must recognize that this crisis was 63. this is why we believe that this category of countries deserves special attention from the international community. we hope that in the new development strategy and in the programmes being followed by the united nations system as a whole the bulk of aid will be devoted to those countries which are the poorest. 64. in this context we would like to stress the particular difficulties of land-locked countries. for some time the international community has been aware of the situation. the united nations has even advocated special measures aimed at them. 65. the creation of the united nations special fund for land-locked developing countries was a response to these countries concern. unfortunately, for reasons which are still unclear, this fund enjoyed neither the sympathy nor the necessary support of the developed countries for the achievement of its aims. we can only express our regret, because the problem of being landlocked can only be overcome with the aid of the industrialized countries. when we say this we in no way wish to minimize sub-regional or regional co-operation in this field. 66. the need for granting greater financial and technical assistance is particularly justified because these land-locked countries fall into the category of the least advanced of the developing countries. as members know, the international community has been made constantly aware of the vulnerable position of these poorest of the developing countries. 67. in response to the wishes expressed by these countries, the fifth session of unctad advocated a programme of action which deserves the unreserved support of member states and the whole of the international community. within the same context, we hope that the international community will strengthen its - co-operation with the countries which have suffered from drought, and natural disasters and those which suffer from geographical disadvantages. 68. assistance on the part of the developed countries will only be able to achieve its objectives to the extent that the developing countries themselves are convinced of the need to strengthen their co-operation. 69. the united nations conference on technical co-operation among developing countries, held in buenos aires last year, set up some important milestones in this area. we would like to reaffirm our support for the plan of action adopted by the conference. it does, indeed, seem to us appropriate to appeal to our friends in the third world who possess technology adapted to our conditions of development or who possess sizeable financial resources. in this context, we welcome as an important factor the intense co-operation which exists between africa and the arab world, whose historical, geographical and cultural ties are guarantees for the strengthening of this solidarity. 70. we are also gratified by the growing co-operation between africa, asia and latin america. 71. however, this co-operation among developing countries would be strengthened if the movement of people and goods were not curbed by, among other things, the lack of infrastructure in the fields of transportation and communications. this is particularly true of africa. the united nations has officially recognized this fact by the proclamation of the united nations transport and communications decade in africa for the period 1978-1988. this decision has been welcomed as an essential factor in the integrated development strategy of the african continent. we therefore hope that the programme and the measures proposed by the oau will call forth a widespread response from member states and the whole united nations system. 72. we should like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to undp, which has done pioneer work in this field. indeed, undp has set the tone by its decision to set aside a certain sum from its reserves in order to support the objectives of the decade. it is our firm hope that this example will be followed by member states and all international institutions. 73. it is, further, indispensable to reserve an important place in the new development strategy for the united nations transportation and communications decade in africa. in our view this would be an important contribution to the advent of the new international economic order. 74. the new world order is founded not only on justice and equity in international economic relations, but also on the democratization of information. it is impossible to stress too much the role that information can play in the area of comprehension among men and mutual understanding among peoples. we believe that in order to attain this objective it is indispensable to strengthen vertical and horizontal co-operation with the view of bringing about free and balanced circulation of information. we must recognize the value and quality of the work done in this area by unesco. 75. we should also like to encourage the work of the committee to review united nations public information policies and activities. we would, however, welcome close co-operation between unesco and the united nations department of public information. in this effort to seek objectivity in the field of information, we must recognize the important role of non- official organizations. we must encourage efforts to establish better organized and more fruitful cooperation between the public and private information sectors. 76. we, for our part, are ready to look into any formulas for co-operation with the representatives of the information sector, a sector which exercises such a great influence on the lives of individuals and peoples. indeed, it would be no exaggeration to claim that much change in the world is the result of the technological revolution in the information media. for example, if respect for human rights is today an important element in the credibility of a government, this is in large measure due to the publicity resources employed by the information media. 77. since we are on the subject of human rights, should like to make clear the position of my government on this question, which is a matter of fundamental concern to the international community. 78. for a long time, stress has been laid on civil and political rights, while economic, social and cultural rights have been left aside. for our part, we believe that all these rights are indissolubly linked in terms of their conception and the universality of their application. conceived in this way human rights embrace the rights of the individual in general, of women and children in particular, and also the rights of peoples and states. 79. it is clear to us that it is the whole gamut of human rights that should guide us in our policies and positions in the appropriate united nations organs. as a member of the commission on human rights, burundi has every intention of discharging its responsibilities in this area. 80. we hope thus to deserve the confidence which the governments of member states have placed in our revolution. 81. we assure the assembly of the commitment of our government to the triumph of the cause of liberty for men and peoples. in this way we will contribute to the building of a better world in which justice and co-operation prevail. we say this because, like all the other members of the assembly, we are convinced that all our efforts should be aimed at the building of a new society, based on friendship and solidarity. for humanity, to which we all belong, shares a common destiny, 82. the participation of all the nations of this general assembly is the most convincing testimony of their commitment to justice and solidarity. 83. we wish to extend our greetings to this assembly as the builders of this society where peace, brotherhood and solidarity will prevail.",Burundi,Africa,22.5085506439209,2.803359985351563,5462.0,18.0,0.0,18.0,3.2954961552544857
MAR,37,1982,"it gives me great pleasure, mr. president, to extend to you, on behalf of the delegation of the kingdom of morocco and in my own capacity, our congratulations on your election as president of this session of the assembly. there is no doubt that your diplomatic career and your knowledge of both inter-national and united nations affairs will assist you in bearing the considerable responsibility that is now yours. the delegation of morocco assures you of its full co-operation in making your presidency a success, particularly because of the relations of friend-ship and co-operation our two countries enjoy. it also gives me pleasure to commend your predecessor, mr. kittani, for his untiring efforts during an eventful year in which he evinced admirable foresight and patience, which was very much appreciated. 111. i should like to avail myself of this opportunity to extend my cordial congratulations to mr. perez de cuellar on his election as secretary-general. i am sure that his considerable experience in international affairs and the respect and confidence he enjoys among the world community qualify him to work creatively and positively in the defence of international peace and ensure the triumph of the purposes and principles of the charter of the united nations. i wish also to congratulate his predecessor, mr. waldheim, on his action and efforts at a time characterized by tension and danger. 112. it is traditional in this hall at the beginning of each session of the general assembly for our common hopes and aspirations for the strengthening of peace and understanding, the triumph of justice and right and the emergence of an era of prosperity and well-being for mankind to be expressed. it is regrettable to note at the beginning of this debate that hotbeds of tension are still giving rise to serious threats to international peace and security and that the international situation is deteriorating because of the new obstacles which have recently almost shattered our hope of establishing genuine and comprehensive detente. 113. this state of affairs will persist as long as there are those who wilfully violate the principles of the charter and flout international law, infringing the dignity of man and his b8sic rights; as long as colonialism, racial discrimination and the deterioration of the international economic situation, which results in increasing impoverishment of the world population, continue. in addition to this, the arms race and its attendant dangers threaten the achievements of mankind. 114. because it is a member of the arab world, the islamic group and the african continent, and because of its geographical situation at the crossroads of three civilizations, morocco attributes great importance to what happens in all these areas. 115. the question of the middle east, and especially the palestinian question, occupies a place of the highest priority among the concerns of my country. for more than 30 years the palestinian people have suffered exile and deprivation and have been the victim of war and destruction. in spite of the voices raised every year from this rostrum condemning i3raeli practices and demanding that the palestinian people regain their inalienable rights, despite the resolutions adopted by the assembly and the security council in support of the rights of that militant people, israel is persisting in its expansionist and repressive acts with all the means at its disposal, including the use of internationally banned weapons, in order to continue to occupy the arab territories and annihilate the palestinian people, in an attempt to eliminate them, suppress them and liquidate their leaders in the form of the plo. 116. although the united nations archives are filed with reports on massacres and assassinations carried out by israel against the palestinian people for more than 30 years, the tragedy and suffering resulting from the israeli invasion of lebanon and t:-'e massacres of the palestinian and lebanese peoples are beyond all bounds and beyond imagination. 117. the abominable massacre planned by the israeli army of occupation in the camps of sabra and shatila claimed more than 4,000 victims among innocent palestinians, including women, children and old people. it reminds us of a similar massacre carried out by meacham begin in the palestinian village of deir yassin in 1947, and it transcends in atrocity and the manner in which it was committed the deeds of the nazis during the second world war. 113. this butchery shows beyond doubt that the real aim of israel is not security, as it claims, but the total physical elimination of the militant palestinian people and expansion at the expense of the arab nation. morocco pays its tribute to the memory of the martyred victims of israeli terrorism and expresses its gratitude and appreciation to those that have condemned and denounced this atrocious massacre and taken the side of right and justice. all the states of the world have expressed their individual condemnation of that massacre and the international community has denounced it collectively. the general assembly, at its seventh emergency special session, adopted resolution es-7/9 on 24 september 1982 condemning the criminal massacre and reaffirming security council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982) demanding that israel with-draw all its military forces to the internationally recognized boundaries of lebanon. 119. in the face of this human tragedy it is more necessary than ever for the general assembly to take all the measures called for, including the imposition of sanctions, to compel israel to put an end to its aggression against the palestinian people, to withdraw forthwith and unconditionally from the territory of lebanon and to comply with the resolutions of the security council. 120. morocco, a sister state of lebanon, takes this opportunity to reaffirm its full solidarity with lebanon in its time of trial and to assure the lebanese government of its support for the measures necessary to guarantee the unity, independence and sovereignty of lebanon. 121. the two parts of the twelfth arab summit conference were held in fez, morocco, under the leadership of his majesty king hassan 11. my country thus had the honour of acting as host to this historic conference which restored unity to the arab ranks and placed arab solidarity on firm foundations. 122. the arab summit conference was convened in extremely delicate circumstances for the causes of palestine and the middle east, and the arab heads of state shouldered their historic responsibility and agreed to the plan designed to enable the arabs to regain their rights. they did so because of their conviction that the arab nation can achieve its aims and overcome the consequences of the israeli aggression. 123. the arab nations, out of their concern to use all ways and means at their disposal to re-establish in the middle east peace based on justice and to contribute to the efforts exerted by all the .peace:. loving forces in the world, in the vanguard of which is the united nations, and on the basis of international law, the arab peace plan, with the following elements: first, israel's withdrawal from all the territories it has occupied since 1%7, including jerusalem; secondly, the right of the palestinian people to self-determination, to the exercise of its inalienable rights under the leadership of the plo, its sole legitimate representative, and to the establishment of an independent state on its land; thirdly, the establishment by the security council of guarantees for peace among the states of the region. 124. a study of those principles should convince the assembly and the world public that the arab nation desires peace based on justice and a solution to the middle east problem that guarantees to the palestinian people its right to self-determination and to establish its own independent state and that makes it possible for all the states of the region to live in peace, with security council guarantees. 125. morocco, whois sovereign. his majesty king hassan 11, presided over the twelfth arab summit conference, calls upon all peace-loving states, andespecially the great powers, permanent members of the security council, to support right and justice, to study the arab peace plan carefully and to adopt the principles contained in that plan as the basis for the solution of the middle east and palestine problems. we hope that there will be a favourable reaction t9 this arab initiative and that it will usher in a new era .that will restore peace and stability to the middle east region and bring to an end the state of war which has afflicted the people of the region for so long. 126. the favourable reaction and the broad support with which the arab peace plan has met on the inter-national scene is encouraging. we hope that all states especially the great powers permanent members of the security council, will support the plan and that the high-level committee set up by the summit conference will be able to establish contacts with the permanent members of the security council and to achieve positive results. 127. we should like to note also that mr. reaganis plan for peace in the middle east gives cause for optimism. morocco regards this plan as a measure that opens new prospects for a solution to the middle east problem, and that places on record the commitment of the president of the united states of america to the principle of the restoration to arab sovereignty of the arab territories occupied by israel in 1%7. at the same time, we note that this plan omits basic points essential to the process for the establishment of peace in the middle east. we hope that during the forthcoming contacts between the arab countries and the united states of america these gaps will be filled so that a just and lasting peace can be achieved in the middle east and that region may once again be the cradle of constructive coexistence and a centre for the dissemination of creative thought. 128. in north-west africa there is still artificial tension resulting from a policy which runs counter to the noble principles established by the international community, which is based on desperate attempts to undermine international law and which resorts to hegemony as a means of achieving selfish interests. the so-called problem of western sahara serves as a pretext and an instrument to that end. morocco has always made it clear that its desire to regain its saharan territory is based on solid historical rights and legal ties, as well as international law. after the moroccan liberation army had engaged in a heroic struggle against the colonizers in saharan territory, morocco called for the restoration of the land usurped at the beginning of the colonial era of this century. because of the colonial authorities' procrastination in returning this land to the mother country, morocco had recourse to juridical bodies. it submitted the question to the united nations and to the international court of justice. that resulted finally in the conclusion of the madrid agreement, confirmed by the general assembly in 1975. 129. morocco has clearly set forth here on several occasions the political and historical circumstances in which moroccan territory had been divided into various regions and subjected to various colonial systems. it has also clearly indicated that the restoration of the amputated parts of its country was also -by the very nature of things-carried out in various stages. 130. because of morocco's faithfulness to inter-national legality, and because of its desire to give that legality a new form that would bode well for the future, his majesty king hassan n, at the eighteenth ordinary session of the assembly of heads of state and government of the oau, which was held at nairobi in june 1981, stated that morocco was prepared 10 hold a referendum in the region of western sahara, thereby opening the door to a final, peaceful solution to this conflict. morocco put forward that initiative because it was convinced of its inalienable right to the territory and of the fact that its children in the region of the sahara had chosen to remain forever an integral part of the mother country. 131. his majesty king hassan's initiative was in part. in response to the wishes of morocco's friends and also was intended clearly to show the world public and to assure jt that the inhabitants of the sahara region wished to belong to the mother country and, through a referendum, to confirm what they had expressed on many occasions and in many different ways: their moroccan identity, to which they are very attached. 132. the whole world welcomed this initiative, finding in it the ideal means for ending the long-standing tension in that part of north-west africa. morocco made every effort to give this initiative the chance to bring about peace, and to have it acted upon. morocco, represented by its sovereign, thus made an important contribution to a settlement of the problem of western sahara at nairobi, in august 1981. the african leaders laid the foundations for such a settlement by establishing the oau's implementation committee 9 which was to concern itself with the cease-fire and the referendum. morocco-thus made an effective contribution to the success of that african meeting, whose goal was to move the peace process forward to its desired end. the implementation committee continued working effectively to bring about the implementation of the resolutions of the oau assembly. especially since the adoption by the general assembly of its decision 36/406, the text of which had been sponsored by kenya, then chairman of the oau assembly, calling on the united nations to extend technical and financial assistance in this field to the oau. 133. the implementation committee met again on 8 and 9 february 1982, to decide on a time-frame for the cease-fire and referendum. in co-operation with african leaders, morocco worked with sincerity to put the final touches on this african effort, which would have ended one of the disputes which have been the concern of the oau over the past years. good will dictated that all efforts made by the african leaders should be given a chance to bear fruit, but there are those who do not wish to find a solution to this problem, and that fact led to the cancellation of the initiative. when it became dear that there was a serious turn of events which would lead to the derailment of failure of hegemonies expansion plans and confirm the inalienable rights of morocco through free consultation under united nations and oau auspices, attempts were made to abort that process and to undermine the resolutions adopted at the oau assembly at nairobi. the well known plot thus took place at addis ababa which immobilized the work of the oau and its activities halted when certain countries. in secret collaboration with the oau administrative secretary-general, tried to impose a group of mercenaries as participants in the thirty-eighth 'ordinary session of the council of ministers of .the oau. that wanton act was in flagrant violation of the qad charter, which stipulates in more than one place that membership is confined to independent sovereign states. that act was furthermore, a conspiracy to undermine all the practical measures adopted by africa to solve the saharan problem in a peaceful manner. 134. the leaders of the african nations represented by the ""wise men"" the founders of the oau, opposed that conspiracy against legality, and 19, delegations withdrew from the session of the oau council of ministers held at addis ababa in february 1982, which is where the conspiracy was acted out. that session was therefore illegal because there was no quorum as required in the oau charter. 135. to overcome this crisis, the african continent was the scene of intense political activity aimed at saving the oau from collapse. some african leaders called for a special session of the oau assembly to solve the problem; morocco was among the first to take such an initiative. his majesty king hassan ,11 sent a letter to the president of kenya, mr. daniel arap moi, in february this year, requesting that, ~ special session be held to consider the existing' crisis before it worsened. but the forces fighting against legitimacy worked to preventthat meeting. 136. once more, we see that enlightened africa, which has opted for legitimacy, has shown itself to be above submitting to the policy of fait accompli. it refused to attend the oau assembly scheduled to be held at tripoli unless african legitimacy, in accordance with the oau charter, was restored to the oau. the frustration and failure of the session of the oau assembly at tripoli is a testimony to legitimacy and justice and the failure of attempts to violate the african charter. 137. that failure caused the immobilization of the work of the oau at all levels-political, economic, social, as well as in the field of information; but we are convinced t.hat the oau-which is backed and supported by every sincere african-will once. more play its constructive role:, thanks to the efforts made by the sincere sons of africa, who value legitimacy and higher african interests above all other considerations and narrow selfish interests. 138. morocco-which has played a pioneering role in crystallizing the idea of african unity through the african charter, adopted in casablanca in '1961, and which is one of the founders of the oau-would very much like that organization to continue. morocco will thus do its utmost to maintain and support the cau so that it may continue to play its vital and effective role as an instrument of common african action. morocco is extremely concerned that legitimacy be restored to the oau and that the organization's administrative bodies should concern themselves with the implementation of african resolution with integrity and neutrality, free of any bias and without 'be'-coming involved in current disputes among ""certain member countries. 139. the united nations followed closely the african meetings held last year to discuss the question of sahara. its representatives gave to the african leaders, useful help by describing the experience of the united nations in the holding of referendums. they know the 'stages that must be gone through in arriving at a cease-fire and holding a referendum. 140. morocco which has always proclaimed its adherence to international legitimacy reaffirms its commitment to the resolutions of the eighteenth session of the oau assembly concerning sahara which were supported last year by the general assembly. it sees the way chosen by africa as the best means of ending the artificial tensions in north-west africa. proceeding from that .premise, morocco appeals to all states to work for the success of that african solution and to frustrate an attempts to block and obstruct it, so that the conflict can be ended and peace and stability can be restored to this area. 141. morocco, as a part of the african continent, attaches special importance to the events that take place there. it works in co-operation with its african brothers to support the independence of the countries of the continent and ensure the progress and development of their peoples, so that the whole continent may enjoy well-being and prosperity and play its role in building a world society founded upon justice and peace. 142. in the southern part of this continent, the brother people of namibia is still suffering under the yoke of an unjust racist regime and waging a valiant war of liberation to restore its usurped liberty, independence and territorial integrity. morocco, which has always supported the just struggle of the namibian people, hopes that the day when independence is restored to that people will soon be here. on this occasion, we appeal to the contact group to redouble its efforts and negotiations so that a final settlement of the namibian problem may be reached in accordance with security council resolution 435 (1978). 143. the people of southern africa are still suffering from the tragedy of the regime of racial discrimination imposed by the government of pretoria, despite the many resolutions 1:ondemning that regime and denouncing apartheid as a ""crime against humanity"" . 144~ morocco reaffirms its support for the people of south africa, which must regain its dignity and free-dom. it calls on those countries which have relations with pretoria to break off their economic and military collaboration with it in order to induce it to end that regime, which is a challenge to the most basic legal and ethical principles. 145. morocco, which is pledged to defend all struggles for liberation, reaffirms its determination to defend all struggles for liberation in africa, in the south, the horn of africa, eritrea or elsewhere in the continent. 146. for more than two years a destructive war has been raging between two neighbouring islamic countries, iraq and the islamic republic .of iran. those two countries were the cradles of ancient civilizations that helped to develop the thinking, science and progress of humanity. if is regrettable that the war between those two countries should still be going on despite all the untiring efforts to bring it to an end. we hope that it will soon be possible to reach a settlement that win effect a cease-fire, safe-guard the inalienable rights of the two states, and restore stability and security to the area, within the framework of security council resolutions 514 (1982) of 12 july 1982 and 522 (1982) of 4 october 1982. 147. the initiative taken by our sister nation of iraq recently, which took the form of withdrawing its army to the borders it had held before the hostilities, is, we believe, a positive step towards the restoration of peace and the consolidation of relations of good-neighbourliness. iraq's response to all mediation efforts to end this conflict deserves our encouragement and praise. we also pin great hopes to the efforts of the peace committee of the organization of the islamic conference, presided over by mr. ahmed sekoutoure, president of guinea, efforts directed to restoring peace and security to that important part of the world. 148. in afghanistan the people is still suffering from the injustices of the invasion of that land three years ago. it is still fighting to preserve its islamic faith and its identity as a moslem and non-aligned nation. morocco, which is linked with the moslem people of afghanistan by ties of religion, culture and civilization, calls for the withdrawal of an foreign forces from afghan territory, enabling the people to choose the political system it desires in full freedom. 149. in democratic kampuchea, we note that the vietnamese army has not responded to the call of the international community to withdraw from that country so that its people can freely choose its own political system. we still believe that the declaration and resolution adopted by the international conference on kampuchea6 constitute the basis for the best solution of this problem. 150. as for relations between the two parts of korea, we hope that (ne governments of the north and the south will resume a positive and constructive dialogue with a view to bringing about gradually the peaceful reunification of korea. 151. morocco has always maintained good relations with the states of the mediterranean basin, and is striving to create favourable conditions for that region to be transformed into a zone of peace and co-operation, in accordance with general assembly resolution.36/l02. on that basis, and within the frame-work of the efforts of the conference on security and co-operation in europe, morocco has supported and still supports the efforts made to strengthen peace and security and ensure co-operation in the region. 152. it is a recognized fact that international detente is linked to disarmament and that the arms race is a serious threat to the existence and the survival of man. it is the two blocs that motivate the arms race, but it is the developing countries that are the principal victims, because it prejudices their economic and social progress, increases their debt burden and lessens their security. 153. it is regrettable that the international efforts to change the situation have so far produced no positive results. this is especially true of the second special session of the general assembly devoted to disarmament, which failed to achieve any concrete progress in this respect. 154. morocco, associating itself with those who work for disarmament at the regional or the international level, appeals to the super-powers, which bear a special responsibility for the maintenance of peace, to redouble their efforts to reach agreement on a comprehensive programme of disarmament, with a carefully prepared timetable, so that disarmament does not become a mere theory which cannot be put into practice. 155. the utmost attention must be paid to tackling the chronic injustice of the world economic system particularly since the developing countries are the most affected by this. international economic institutions in all fields and areas of competence recognize the urgent need for a radical change in the world economic system, especially following the sixth and seventh special sessions of the general assembly, which stressed the inevitability of such change. certain achievements benefiting the third world such as the charter of economic rights and duties of states, the generalized system of preferences and the integrated commodities programme and certain such concepts as the common economic self-sufficiency of the developing countries and the new international economic order, must have positive effects on north-south relations. in -order to make the establishment of the new economic order possible, the third world states have called for the beginning of a series of negotiations on all aspects of international co-operation for development, in accordance with the programmes of action approved by the general assembly or recommended by various international bodies, in particular unctad, with a view to the attainment of the objectives of the third united nations development decade. 156. experience has shown that partial economic solutions in the narrow national context and negotia-tions limited to specified sectors are only palliatives. the real solution is to be found in global negotiations leading to collective solutions to world economic problems. 157. it is regrettable that the developed countries remain deaf to the appeals of the countries of the third world and that they have strengthened their protectionist tariff and non-tariff measures and reduced the level of their external aid, which half had a serious effect on the terms of trade, the balance of payments and the employment situation. the deterioration in the terms of trade and the increase in indebtedness have shattered any hope of achieving economic and social development in the developing countries, in particular the least developed countries. 158. the latest annual report of the world bank showed the weakness of the third world economies and drew attention to the dangers facing the poor countries, particularly as regards agricultural production and food deficits. the rich countries must therefore abandon their selfishness and their narrow national interests and recognize the interdependence of the economic progress of the north and the need to speed up the economic, social and technical development of the south, because their common interests impose on all the parties the joint responsibility for establishing a new international economic order and building a better world for all mankind. 159. the entire international community should rejoice at the adoption of the united nations convention on the law of the sea by the majority of states members. that convention, which will be signed officially in jamaica in the first two weeks of december, is the culmination df tremendous efforts. we hope that certain member states will prove to be more flexible regarding their objections so that ""his convention may come into force after its signature and ratification. this would make possible the establishment of a new era of fruitful co-operation. 160. the organization is a haven of peace and security in a world swept by fierce winds of conflict, war and violence, and in which there is much under-development, poverty and injustice. it is a source' of hope for the alleviation and elimination of the evils of fear and underdevelopment. since its inception in 1945 the organization has made possible profound changes in the political map of the world. it has supported weak, conquered nations and helped them to achieve independence; it has devoted its efforts to conciliation and the settlement of conflicts. it has also opened up new perspectives in the field of international economic, scientific and cultural co-operation. 161. despite all this, an enormous task lies ahead and demands our full support so that the noble mission assigned to the united nations under the charter may be fulfilled-that of contributing to the prosperity and the well-being of mankind as a whole and of spreading peace and security throughout the world.",Morocco,Africa,30.2577991485596,6.122680187225342,4754.0,12.0,0.0,12.0,2.5241901556583928
TUN,39,1984,"allow me, sir, to add my congratulations to all those already extended to you on the occasion of your election as president of the general assembly at its thirty-ninth session. by unanimously entrusting that responsibility to you, the assembly is paying a tribute to your great qualities and honouring your country, with which tunisia maintains friendly, trusting and harmonious relations. 77. we are sure that your authority, your competence and your vast experience of international relations will be of invaluable assistance in guiding our debates and our decisions and will thus ensure a positive outcome for our deliberations. the tunisian delegation pledges you its full co-operation as you perform this noble mission. 78. allow me to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to your predecessor, mr. jorge illueca, president of the republic of panama, for his out-standing work throughout his term of office, and particularly in its most difficult moments. 79. i should like also to extend our warm congratulations to the secretary-general for the tireless efforts he has been making to put an end to the conflicts which are raging in various parts of the world and for the report on the work of the organization, a remarkably lucid and realistic report, which he recently submitted to this assembly. 80. finally, i should like to welcome into our midst brunei darussalam, which has just become a member of the united nations. we rejoice at the admission of this new member at a time when this international body particularly needs the contribution of all the nations of the world in order to take up the many challenges that face it. 81. it is not succumbing to discouragement and to despair to emphasize the steady deterioration of the environment in which we live and the virtual inability of the international community to alter the dangerous course of events in any way. it is also disturbing to note the paralysis which is steadily gripping the united nations in the vital sphere of the maintenance of international peace and security, for which the organization is responsible under its charter. of course, we are all aware of the extent of the problems we face and of their complexity, but is this any reason for giving up hope and taking no action? 82. since the last session of the general assembly, monologue has followed monologue. tension in east- west relations, far from abating, is still dangerously present. we are caught up in a crisis. almost everywhere we look, there is deadlock. 83. the soviet-united states strategic arms reduction talks, which have been suspended for months, seem unlikely to resume soon. in europe, deployment of missiles is met with counter-deployment. the ""super"" arms race is resuming its diabolical course, extending to space itself. in fact, the militarization of space, which yesterday was something out of science fiction, is today a reality which adds a new dimension to the arms race and to the risks of global conflagration. 84. rather than being resolved, the regional conflicts besetting the countries of the third world are growing worse, becoming entrenched over the years and thereby creating intolerable situations for the peoples who have to bear them. these local conflicts are indeed running sores which threaten the peace and security of the regions in question, thus opening the way for foreign intervention and super-power rivalry. 85. at a time when the two super-powers seem disposed to consult one another about these conflicts, let us hope that they will remember that the parties to a conflict are those most concerned and that any solution which does not take their interests into account, or which is achieved at their expense or without their participation, is bound to fail in the long run. past and present history abounds in lessons to this effect. 86. the situation in two non-aligned countries, afghanistan and kampuchea, has for several years now, unfortunately, provided us with a graphic illustration of this state of affairs. in this connection, tunisia reaffirms its support for the search for any solution which would guarantee the independence, neutrality and freedom of choice of those two countries, in accordance with the relevant united nations resolutions, which call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops and an end to all interference in their internal affairs. 87. the palestinian people, whether living under israeli tyranny in the occupied territories or in their diaspora, are distressed to see the chances of peace receding daily. the hope of some palestinians for a change of government in israel that would bring about a more flexible policy has yet to materialize. in fact, we have seen the legalization of fascist and racist movements known for their excessive demands on the populations of the occupied territories. those extremist movements today proclaim openly their intention of expelling the arab inhabitants from the territories where their ancestors dwelt for centuries. 88. is it conceivable that a state member of the united nations should be able, through the oppression and exclusion of a section of its population which it regards as second-class citizens, to appropriate their land and their property? 89. if every peace initiative has come up against israel's implacable intransigence, this is because over the years that country has been able to count on substantial economic and military aid, as well as unreserved diplomatic support, from its alliesfactors which have reinforced it in its attitude. 90. if tel aviv is opposed to any just and lasting settlement of the palestinian question, based on the recognition of the inalienable right of the palestinian people to self-determination and to create their own state, in accordance with united nations resolutions, it is because such a solution is incompatible with the expansionist concept of ""greater israel"", which israeli leaders are implementing by rapidly building settlements in order to create an irreversible situation. 91. rejection of a palestinian state, refusal to negotiate with the plo, refusal to return to the borders of 1967, refusal to put a freeze on settlements, refusal to accept any initiative for a peaceful settlement no matter whence it comes, including the plan proposed by president reagan of the united states-this is neither more nor less than the programme of the israeli government. 92. since 1967, more than a third of the land in the west bank has come under the control of the occupying authorities, to which must be added the seizure of water resources, the population's use of which is subject to draconian restrictions. 93. this is the face of israeli expansionism, which is today the main obstacle to the advent of genuine peace in the region. is it conceivable that a state member of the united nations should be able to continue to flout international legality with complete impunity? what we have here is a paradoxical situation which is contrary to ethics, international law and the very principles of the charter of the united nations and which undermines the credibility of the organization. 94. since the signing of the camp david accords, the prospect of settling the palestinian problem has become increasingly remote, despite the various attempts made to secure a just and lasting peace in the region. 95. tunisia, for its part, while reaffirming its support for the arab peace plan contained in the final declaration of the twelfth arab summit conference, adopted at fez on 9 september 1982 believes that any effort in favour of a just and lasting peace in that region warrants consideration by the international community. it makes an urgent appeal to the united nations, and in particular the permanent members of the security council, which have the right of veto and occasionally abuse it, to shoulder their responsibility to end the violence which continues to buffet this region and to contribute to a rapid resumption of the peace process, based on right and justice. 96. in lebanon, israel's leaders have learned from their past mistakes no lessons for their present behaviour. the so-called ""peace in galilee"" operation having failed, they are now trying their best to isolate southern lebanon, where the lebanese resistance is carrying on a bitter struggle against them. this area, which represents approximately a third of lebanese territory, has been cut off from the rest of the country, with the help of control installations, and left to the tyranny of the israeli military administration. what is more, israel is now putting into effect a plan to divert the waters of lebanon's rivers for its own use, in defiance of the rules of international law. 97. the international community must do all it can to put an end to israeli interference in lebanon's affairs; it must call on israel to withdraw its army immediately from southern lebanon, in conformity with security council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982). 98. in solidarity with that fraternal country, tunisia reaffirms its full support for lebanon's territorial integrity and independence. it pledges its support for all the efforts that country is making to bring about the indispensable national reconciliation which is the best guarantee of its security and stability. 99. the armed conflict between iraq and iran, two neighbouring countries, has been raging for four years now, causing the loss of countless lives and the destruction of the economic potential of both countries. it is high time that this fratricidal war was ended, especially since iraq has agreed to an immediate cease-fire, under united nations supervision, and to embark on the path to a peaceful settlement of the dispute in accordance with the principles of international law and the relevant resolutions of the united nations and other organizations. 100. the continuance of this war, which threatens to envelop the whole of the troubled region, brings the threat of internationalization of the conflict closer. hence the urgent need to halt this dangerous process and to resume efforts to make the parties to the conflict commit themselves to solving their dispute around the table, either directly within the framework of the united nations or through mediation. 101. africa, which is beset by development problems compounded by climatic phenomena such as drought and desertification and where broad sectors of the population still suffer from malnutrition and disease despite the continent's tremendous potential wealth, aspires to a climate of peace and stability in order to be able to devote all its energies to developing its resources and promoting the well-being of its peoples. conflicts persist, however, sometimes fuelled by east-west rivalry. 102. the recent developments in southern africa raise questions and arouse certain misgivings. although we understand their motivation, this should not be a reason for relaxing the constant, vigilant efforts undertaken at the international and regional levels by the united nations and the oau to bring about the liberation of namibia and the eradication of apartheid. nor should it be a reason for undermining the just struggle of the national liberation movements, for which tunisia reaffirms its full support. 103. in the case of namibia, tunisia reaffirms its support for the efforts being made within the united nations to ensure the implementation of security council resolution 435 (1978), which remains the corner-stone of any just and lasting settlement of this question. the delaying tactics used and the arbitrary pre-conditions set by pretoria to impede that country's accession to independence cannot deceive anyone or prevent the inevitable liberation of the namibian people. 104. we believe it is necessary, therefore, that a final date be set for namibia's independence. as for the sham elections to which pretoria resorted, the people concerned reserved for them the fate they deserved, despite the bloody repression to which they continue to be subjected. 105. nearer to us, there has been no progress in the situation in western sahara, which constitutes a source of uncertainty and instability in the region. tunisia, which has repeatedly expressed its concern at the stalemate on this question, urgently appeals for a peaceful and lasting solution, in accordance with the resolutions of the oau. 106. tunisia would like to see a lasting solution to this question. it remains convinced that such a solution would make a positive contribution towards bringing peace and stability to our region and, above all, opening the way for the building of the greater maghreb, which is a historic aspiration of our peoples. 107. it might be useful to recall here what i stated before the assembly last year, at the thirty-eighth session, regarding the essential principles on which tunisia has based its policy for joint action by the maghreb countries. those principles are none other than mutual trust, good-neighbourliness, non-interference in the internal affairs of others, mutual consultation on questions of common interest and the promotion of our co-operation on a sound and careful basis far removed from the politics of axes and alliances. this is the spirit of the treaty of concord and brotherhood concluded between tunisia, algeria and mauritania, which we see as a basis for firm ties governing relations among all the countries of the maghreb without exception. tunisia welcomes the positive results achieved by this judicious approach and is optimistic as to its future prospects. it remains convinced that concord, harmony and a communion of effort to ensure progress, development and prosperity will in the long run surmount short-term obstacles and divisions; such is the wish of our peoples; such is the course of history. 108. as for the recent developments in the situation in chad, tunisia, which has always advocated a peaceful solution of the problems of that sister country, free from all outside interference and in accordance with the principles of international law and the charter of the organization of african unity, welcomes the agreement reached between the libyan arab jamahiriya and france on the withdrawal of their respective forces from the territory of chad. we hope that this initiative will contribute to the national reconciliation of the chadian people and to the rebuilding of their country in unity, brotherhood and peace. 109. the economic situation of the countries of the third world remains uncertain and continues to cause us grave concern. some, however, seem to be more concerned at the admittedly excessive indebtedness of the countries of the south than at the tremendous difficulties which most of those countries are now facing. it is obvious that the external debt problem would not have reached such proportions if the debt- servicing ratios had not increased dramatically as a result of the steady deterioration in terms of trade, the contraction of export marketscaused, it must be said, by protectionist measuresand the upward spiral of interest rates, which is due particularly to the fact that this debt is expressed mainly in terms of united states dollars. 110. while the developing countries grapple with insoluble financial problems as a result of this debt foreign assistance levels have not risen since 1980. we are prompted to fear a breakdown in the process of international co-operation, which would threaten the financing of the long-term growth of many third- world countries. in fact, the ida is facing serious financing difficulties. the north-south dialogue is becoming more and more like a plea by the industrialized countries in their own defence than a constructive exchange of views among partners concerned at trends in the world economy. the third-world countries feel very strongly that relations of power continue to impose their law on the international economy. there is no easy solutionthat is clear but calls for realism and patience must not serve as an alibi to cover up the dangerous disparities in international economic relations. 111. although there has been a slight resumption of growth in some industrialized countries, a development that we welcome, we believe that a lasting recovery in the world economy depends on a bold policy of development assistance. 112. it is encouraging to note that some western european industrialized countries, notably norway, the netherlands, sweden and denmark, devote more than 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product to development assistance. 113. at a time when annual development assistance has remained unchanged since the beginning of this decade at a total volume of $33.6 billion, the military budgets of the main industrial powers are growing significantly. when one knows that a million dollars a minute is spent on weapons throughout the world, one realizes the extent of this financial haemorrhage in the name of a security which still remains precarious. we might wonder what the point of such sacrifices is if they do not bring increased security for those who bear their weight, especially since the increase in the number of nuclear weapons poses a threat of unprecedented seriousness to the survival of mankind. the security of our planet is not limited to the search for a strategic arms balance; it also has an economic and social dimension which is vitally important to all peoples. 114. thus, concerted action consistently to reduce military spending and the allocation of the resources transferred to development assistance would do more to ensure security in the world than the most sophisticated weapons. finally, this revival of the arms race is the detriment of development today places the third world in a kind of ""armed peace"" which is prejudicial to understanding and international co-operation. 115. the african countries, which are facing considerable economic difficulties, are suffering more than others from this dramatic state of affairs in our world. the initiative taken recently by the secretary- general to provide assistance to the worst affected african countries is proof of the gravity of the economic problems affecting our continent and has also helped to make world public opinion aware of the grave situation in the african countries and the sufferings of millions of african men, women and children. 116. we hope that the efforts made and the measures taken will not be limited to the immediate and urgent problems but will extend to the solving of structural and future problems obstructing the development of the african continent. 117. as long as the problems of the third world continue to be viewed through the distorting lens of east-west rivalry or understood in terms of strategy, there is absolutely no likelihood of a satisfactory settlement. quite the opposite is likely. these problems must be dealt with through an increase in international co-operation, which presupposes a global political vision based on solidarity and the need for interdependence which nations would genuinely have to assume. that is why we need to see an improvement in the international climate. 118. we do not believe in the inevitability of permanent confrontation. if detente is on the wane, that is because it was confined to europe, whereas zones of tension and conflict persist in other regions of the world. 119. for all its imperfections, the united nations remains the best framework for resuming the dialogue with a view to reconciling points of view and injecting the necessary minimum of understanding into international relations. peace is an irresistible aspiration of all peoples. however, it can be established on a lasting basis only if there is the broadest possible consensus implying justice and the freedom of choice of peoples.",Tunisia,Africa,48.1907005310059,5.517449855804443,3170.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.6309148264984228
MWI,42,1987,"on behalf of the malawi delegation i should like to join those who have spoken before me in congratulating you, sir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the general assembly. the wealth of experience and knowledge of international affairs as well as the diplomatic skills and patience which you bring with you to this lofty seat are well known. we are certain, therefore, that under your guidance the general assembly will achieve positive results. in wishing you success in carrying out your duties and responsibilities, i assure you of my delegation's full co-operation at all times. my delegation equally wishes to express appreciation to your predecessor, mr. choudhury, minister for foreign affairs of bangladesh, for the remarkable way in which he presided over the forty-first session. under his stewardship, many important and historic decisions were made by the general assembly. we wish also to express our great pleasure at the good work undertaken by the secretary-general, mr. javier perez de cuellar, during the past 12 months, particularly that of mediation between parties in conflict. the malawi delegation wishes to congratulate mr. joseph reed on his appointment to the post of under-secretary-general for political and general assembly affairs. while the situation as regards international peace and security continues to cause much concern, we have been encouraged by some positive developments in the past few months. we welcomed the international conference on the relationship between disarmament and development, which was sponsored by the united nations and held here in august and september. we welcomed the adoption by consensus of the final document of the conference. we believe that the document has provided a basis on which to build further towards the achievement of disarmament and therefore the promotion of development around the world. malawi has also been encouraged by indications of progress at the conference on disarmament in geneva, particularly with regard to the question of chemical weapons. my delegation joins others in welcoming the announcement that the two super-powers, the united states and the soviet union, have reached an agreement in principle on an accord on the elimination of intermediate nuclear forces. we note that this will be the first such accord ever and therefore represents a major step forward in the field of nuclear-weapons disarmament. my delegation wishes to congratulate the two sides on this historic development. in so doing, it is our hope that the accord, which we understand could be signed soon, will give a much needed impetus to efforts also to attain disarmament in conventional weapons. for, in the end, international peace and security will best be assured only by complete and comprehensive disarmament. the elimination of or reduction in arms production and arms stockpiling cannot by themselves guarantee international security. for international security depends as much on the conscious promotion of peace as it does on the absence of the tools of war. there is, therefore, an equally urgent need to find ways to bring to an end the areas of conflict and tension that exist in the various regions of the world. in all of these we can clearly see that the main causes are either the denial to peoples of their right to self-determination or the deliberate disregard by some states of the sovereignty and integrity of other states. in the early months of this year, our interest was aroused by sudden developments that seemed to promise positive movement towards breakthroughs on the respective questions of afghanistan and kampuchea. sadly, however, neither the much-heralded reforms and other initiatives announced by the authorities in kabul in january, nor the flurry of diplomatic activity in viet nam a few weeks later would appear to have led to any changes. if anything significant came out of these developments it was perhaps a reaffirmation of what has been repeatedly stated in this assembly; that only the withdrawal of foreign forces will facilitate a meaningful solution to the two respective questions. the peoples of afghanistan and kampuchea must be left to resolve their political differences and determine their political future by themselves. another area of concern in the far east is the korean peninsula. my government remains convinced that the political future of that area can best be determined by the korean people themselves, through genuine dialogue and negotiations between the governments of north korea and south korea. that is why malawi supports the recent call by south korea for talks, without pre-condition, at a higher political level than has been the case in the past. it is our hope that all sides will give the call by south korea serious consideration. in discussing a region which seems beset by seemingly intractable problems, it is a welcome change to be able to applaud something truly and significantly positive. we refer here to the accord signed in july by the governments of india and sri lanka in order to bring about an end to the conflict in northern sri lanka which had threatened permanently to divide the sri lankan people while at the same time promoting tension between the neighbouring states of sri lanka and india. in this regard, we salute the two leaders. president jayewardene of sri lanka and prime minister rajiv gandhi of india, for their singular act of courage and faith. we see the accord as a concrete example of how states can co-operate to promote international peace and security. as we review the situation in the region of the middle east and the persian gulf, we find cause for grave concern in both the apparent widening of the conflict and the threat inherent therein to international peace and security. we have noted with interest the adoption on 20 july 1987 by the security council of resolution 598 (1987), which appears to us to be a reasonable basis for finding a lasting solution to the conflict in the gulf. with regard to the middle east, we in malawi have been encouraged by the growing support for a proposal which was made to the general assembly last year for the convening of an international peace conference, sponsored by the united nations, to be attended by all parties directly concerned in the conflict. war has not been able to end the conflict between the arab states and israel, because war cannot address the crucial issue, the right of all the peoples of the region to self-determination within recognized and secure borders. we have stated before that only through dialogue among all parties to the conflict can the framework for a lasting solution that meets the needs and aspirations of all concerned be found. we believe that the time is now right for such dialogue, and we believe it is right and proper that the united nations should have a central role in facilitating such dialogue. we support the proposal for an international conference on the middle east, my delegation notes with encouragement the return to peace in the mediterranean region following the sudden heightening of tension there in early 1986. however, while we delight in this, we regret that peace and national conciliation in cyprus continues to elude the people of that island state, we support the efforts of the secretary-general aimed at keeping open the channels of communication between the leaders of the greek cypriot and turkish cypriot communities. we regret, however, that those efforts have so far not met with success. we therefore appeal to all those concerned in this matter to co-operate with the secretary-general and accept the need to resume the intercommunal talks as a way towards finding a formula for the lasting solution the foreign invasion of 1974 was unable to provide. malawi welcomes the peace plan recently proposed by the leaders of the central american region with a view to bringing about an end to the various conflicts and tensions in that region. we should like to register our support for their bold initiatives, and we wish them success in this endeavour. on our own continent of africa too, tension and conflict, particularly in the southern african region, continue to pose a threat to international peace and security. there are three main causes of that situation: first, the continued denial to the people of namibia of their right to independence and self-determination, secondly, the attempts by some external forces to impose upon certain countries of the region the types of ideology and forms of government preferred by those forces, in complete disregard of the choices of the citizens of those countries; and thirdly, the problem of apartheid, a political system which the african people and the entire world have unequivocally and unanimously condemned and rejected. with regard to namibia, we reiterate what we have said before: that the independence of namibia is long overdue. security council resolution 435 (1978) met all the legitimate concerns of all the parties to the political dispute over namibia, and all the parties accepted, and still accept, that resolution as the basis for the granting of independence. we can therefore see no justification for the continuing delay in its implementation. indeed, the delay is contributing to the growing toll in lives and to the hardships imposed upon the people in that territory. the malawi delegation has stated many times in the past that force and violence are not, and cannot be, the way to resolve political problems or any other differences. force can at best provide only temporary solutions. we remain convinced that only through contact and dialogue can lasting solutions be found. that is why the malawi government welcomed the recent courageous initiative by some political leaders in south africa in starting a dialogue with the african national congress of south africa (anc), particularly in senegal recently. we are convinced that this development can only be for the good of all south africans, black and white, and we hope it will lead to more and more contacts and wider dialogue including not only the white liberals, on the one hand, and the anc, on the other, but eventually also other white leaders - even government leaders and other representatives of the black majority, such as the pan africanist congress of azania (pac). we have followed with interest the initiatives and programmes undertaken by the united nations during the past year in the area of social development. among these, perhaps the major one was the united nations-sponsored international conference on drug abuse and illicit trafficking, held in vienna in may. the threat drug abuse poses to our future generations and the social problems it presents, particularly for developing countries, have been analysed. it has also been known for some time that combating the production and abuse of and illicit trafficking in drugs requires wide co-operation and concerted action by the world's governments. yet it somehow appeared that, except at the professional level, co-operation was never going to be achieved. while the political leaders of some countries saw the need for the problems of drug production, trafficking and abuse to be addressed at the political level, many others did not yet recognize the magnitude and urgency of the problem. at a time when greater attention was suddenly being given to these issues and more countries were beginning to realize the need for co-operation, the convening of the international conference on drug abuse and illicit trafficking was most timely. we believe it provided an excellent opportunity to bring about a greater understanding of the problem. it provided an opportunity also for those who had already acquired considerable experience in dealing with the problem to share that experience with those who are new to the problem, and for all countries to come up with a strategy for international co-operation. malawi was represented at the vienna international conference on drug abuse and illicit trafficking by a three-member delegation. we believe the conference was a success, and we hope the decisions and plans of action adopted in vienna will be faithfully implemented. we certainly hope too that a review conference will be held at the appropriate time to examine how successful - or unsuccessful - we have been in achieving the goals enunciated at the vienna conference. it is malawi's hope that, in the light of experience gained with regard to drug abuse, consideration will be given to a similar initiative concerning what is clearly emerging as the single most widespread problem with dire implications for the future. we refer here to the killer epidemic of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). we are pleased to note that the world health organization (who) has already begun to devote its attention to the aids problem. we hope that from the lesson learned with regard to that drug problem it will be considered that the early convening of an international conference devoted to the question of aids would be most beneficial. meanwhile we would also like to express our appreciation for the decision by the united nations to give special attention to the population problems in sub-saharan africa. in this context we welcome the strategy for united nations fund for population activities (unfpa) assistance to sub-saharan africa, which was adopted by the united nations development programme (undp) governing council at its thirty-fourth session last june. we are of the view that the programme of action envisaged in the strategy will contribute greatly to the efforts of the governments in the region as they seek to attain an equitable balance between the social and economic development needs of their national populations, on the one hand, and the resources available to their governments to meet those needs, on the other. however, this plan cannot be realized without the unfpa itself having sufficient financial resources to carry out its programmes. we sincerely hope that member states will join hands in assuring the unfpa's financial health and that those who are in a position to do so will consider the possibility of making additional voluntary contributions. in the area of economic co-operation between the rich north and the poor south there appears to be issues which require urgent attention if the serious poverty of the south is to be halted. these issues are, first, greater access for products from the developing south to the markets of the industrialized north; secondly, higher and more lucrative prices for the goods exported from the south in relation to products manufactured and exported by the north; thirdly, a halt in the reverse flow of funds from the developing to the developed countries caused basically by, fourthly, the repayment of debt to lenders in the north. naturally we see these matters as being interrelated. despite the assurances of the industrialized countries to the contrary, we have seen an increase in recent years in both tariff and non-tariff barriers against the exports of developing countries. at the same time, there has been a steady decline in the prices of commodities - most of which are primary goods - from the south while those of manufactures from the north have continued to rise. this is a question of terms of trade. and faced with declining export earnings and soaring import bills, developing countries have been forced to borrow ever more at high interest rates from the same countries of the north in order to sustain their economies. now, many developing countries nave frightfully large fractions of their national incomes committed to debt repayment. herein lies the problem - a source of international dissension. we are glad that at the meeting of the united nations conference on trade and development (unctad) agreement was reached on the need for greater economic assistance to the least-developed countries. the undertaking by the developed countries to encourage lending institutions in their areas to consider being more flexible in order to ease the debt burden of developing countries is also appreciated. however, it is my delegation's hope that greater practical efforts will be made towards helping the export commodities from the poor south to be more lucrative. in this way the debt problem begins to be alleviated. naturally the developing south would have to follow sensible and workable economic policies, which appears to be what they are doing now. in this regard it is also important for my delegation to acknowledge the crucial role played by all the united nations agencies, in particular the united nations development programme (undp) , in our development efforts, in addition to that played by other bilateral and multilateral donors economic community under the lome convention and also the world bank, in addition we are pleased with the important assistance offered to malawi by the african development bank (adb). in our opinion the adb is a very good institution through which the developed countries could increasingly channel funds for the continent's economic development; i am therefore making an appeal to them. finally i should like to say that, in spite of all that has been said about the uncompleted work, unfulfilled promises and unresolved problems by the united nations, many a speaker appears by implication and directly to support the continued existence of the organization. yes, we need the organization. for its part malawi will continue to give the united nations its fullest support and will always be ready to make its contribution towards ensuring the organization's continued existence.",Malawi,Africa,48.5366516113281,2.422250032424927,2867.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.3487966515521451
MUS,45,1990,"we are delighted that the forty-fifth regular session of the general assembly is being presided over by a distinguished personally fro, malta, an island whose active involvement in international affairs is well known and which, like mauritius, has been the crossroads of many civilisations. i am confident, mr. president, that the experience end wisdom you bring to this high office will enrich our deliberations and help us uphold the principles of our organisation during these trying times when the security of swell nations is being threatened. addressing the assembly for the first time, i am personally pleased to say how proud we are to belong to an organisation which today commands respect and authority. as a representative of a small, open, democratic and multiracial state without any defence abilities i find cause for satisfaction in the knowledge that membership in this organization is not a vain hope and that the united nations has the capacity to safeguard international law. it is comforting to note that our organisation, besides having the duty to assert the law, has also the ability to enforce it and to uphold respect for the right of states, small and large and from the north and the south, to exist in peace and harmony. it cannot be sufficiently emphasised that this newly found ability will bring to small member states - which, after all, form the majority of the membership of this organisation - a sense of security based on the right to exist peacefully, as enshrined in our charter. i do not think it unfair to recall that such a situation is relatively new. recent history abounds with examples where the international community was sadly incapable not only of clearly enunciating the law but also of assuming its obligations and ensuring that these rules, approved by all, were respected, freer now of these past constraints, of which snail states were often the unwilling instruments, our organisation, with its new-found unity, its new cohesion, has today the means to fulfil its primary objective. on the other hand let us not forget that the apparent cohesion of the international community and the will displayed by the united nations are still precarious. we might ask ourselves whether the unprecedented demonstration of international solidarity in the present gulf crisis is not motivated as much by vested interests as by respect for international law. it is imperative therefore that we display a renewed sense of our attachment to our fundamental principles wherever and whenever the law is infringed. let it be recorded that the united nations has already to its credit the efficient settlement of serious conflicts, and here we should like to pay a tribute to the secretary-general for the seal, dedication and vision he displays as head of our organization. unfortunately, unresolved crises still cast a shadow on the good faith of our organisation. inequality among peoples still abounds across the world. the palestinians, lebanese, fijians, oppressed by brutal and inhuman forces, certainly deserve the same solidarity as we are today expressing towards the kuwaiti people. imbued with this ideal, mauritius has firmly condemned the invasion of kuwait by iraq and we join in the appeals that have been made for the restoration of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of kuwait. we have entertained good relations with both countries. kuwait used to supply us with half our petroleum needs. our political and diplomatic relations with iraq have been friendly. although peace appears illusive, we nurture the hope that reconciliation will avert say breakout of military hostilities. let us give diplomacy a chance and thus avoid the dire consequences for the hear east and the rest of the world. the conflict in the gulf region seemed even more aberrant at a time when momentous events in europe and elsewhere towards peace and reconciliation were occurring. the new bonds of friendship that have been woven between the ussr and the united states of america, inspired by president gorbachev and president bush, the end of the cold war era and of ideological conflicts, the triumph of liberty and democracy around the world have raised hopes for a new phase of development based on peace. poorer countries, relieved of the burden of prosy wars that diverted much of their slender resources, will now be more able to address priority tasks in the struggle against underdevelopment and poverty. alas, the gulf crisis rudely brought us back to reality. the end of the east-west conflict could well be succeeded by an era of lawlessness jeopardising the security of small states in the face of ambitious designs of powerfully armed neighbours and adversaries. all too often our desire for global solutions has not been matched by political will. up to now international negotiations on economic and development issues, on trade, the debt problem and the environment have resulted in protracted debates but few genuine breakthroughs. as the world is overtaken by the pace of history, nations seem to fall back on old reflexes. nowhere is this better illustrated than in the field of disarmament and security, where the threat of war and aggression remains. in the emerging multipolar world, smaller states are especially vulnerable to such a threat. the capacity of some states to acquire huge and modern arsenals for use in regional conflicts will constitute one of the greatest threats to the security of smaller states. positive development such as the conclusion of the 1987 treaty on intermediate range nuclear missiles, the talks on strategic arms reduction, and the decrease of conventional forces in europe are encouraging. she international community should not overlook the real dangers to peace posed at a regional level and should address the, in a concrete way. in this regard my delegation wishes to reiterate its commitment to the creation of the indian ocean as a zone of peace. my government regrets the withdrawal of the major western powers from the ad h committee on the indian ocean at a time when real progress was at hand, and we express the hope that recent events in the gulf region will convince them of the urgent necessity of working towards the establishment of a zone of peace in the indian ocean. those who appeal to world solidarity and support in tines of trial cannot afford to ignore the just aspirations of smaller nations to peace. countries of the region should recognise that a degree of flexibility might be necessary to overcome controversial issues and advance the cause of peace and security in our part of the world. the efforts of the ad hoc committee at this juncture should not be undermined, and all avenues for progress must remain open. genuine negotiations on a zone of peace would lead to significant progress in other areas, such as that of naval disarmament. confidence- and security-building measures would reduce the risks of incidents and confrontations at sea and would enhance the security of coastal states and contribute to a safer regional environment. while we are addressing the issue of the indian ocean, we wish to reiterate our just and rightful claim to the chagos archipelago, including diego garcia, and express our deep appreciation of the whole-hearted support of the members of the ron-aligned movement and the organisation of african unity, as well as that of other friendly countries. we also attach great importance to current negotiation, within the review conference on the nuclear-non-proliferation treaty and its eventual extension in 1995. at a time when modern armament is increasingly multidimensional and technologically advanced, the proliferation of nuclear weapons constitutes a major threat to the security of all states. nuclear-weapon states should therefore demonstrate greater willingness to reduce their arsenals and commit themselves to a process of disarmament by offering, in addition, specific security assurances to non-nuclear-weapon states. similarly, restraint and control should be exercised for other weapons of arms destruction. the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty at the forthcoming partial test-ban treaty amendment conference next year should be encouraged to the full. the most remarkable event on our continent was the achievement of the independence of namibia after years of relentless struggle. we extend to namibia a warm and brotherly welcome. another equally important landmark was the liberation of nelson mandela. his historic address from the rostrum, of this hall displayed the conviction of his long and heroic struggle against the evils of apartheid. the situation in south africa has remained precarious despite genuine progress towards a negotiated peaceful political settlement. it is our view that we should give cautious encouragement to further such progress until it becomes permanent and irreversible, leading to the total eradication of apartheid. there is therefore at the present time no occasion for undue haste for the relaxation of international pressure. violence and the temptation to exploit internal divisions could easily jeopardise the chances of peace and stability. the agreement concluded in august between the african national congress of south africa (anc) and the south african government represents the best hope for the complete eradication of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic and non-racial society in south africa. all parties that are really committed to a peaceful solution should work towards the preparation of a new constitution that will meet the hopes and aspirations of the people of south africa as a whole. the emergence of a strong, united, multiracial and democratic south africa will bring peace and stability to the region and contribute significantly to world economy. at a broader level, 1989 and 1990 have witnessed events which have led to a fundamental restructuring of the world political system. today, more than ever, the interdependence of nations is the basis for fruitful international relations. at both international and regional levels, this unique organisation, which is the united nations, is the right vehicle for collective action, especially in moments of crisis and distress. st has thus far mounted successful operations in namibia and central america. i am positive it could play a crucial role in resolving major regional conflicts, for example in cambodia, whore certain encouraging developments have taken place at the jakarta meeting. in the middle east, we welcome the new dialogue between the united states and the soviet union on the issue. we are more than ever convinced that an international peace conference on the middle east, under the auspices of the united nations, constitutes the only prospect for a comprehensive settlement recognising the inalienable rights of the palestinian people, and for enduring peace in the region. we also hope that meaningful dialogue and consultation in response to the legitimate aspirations of the korean people will pave the way in the not too distant future for the peaceful unification of korea. in this context my country will give favourable consideration to the admission of the republic of korea as a member of the organization without jeopardising the objective of unification and without excluding the simultaneous membership of the democratic people's republic of korea. we should not lose sight of the relationship between disarmament and development. it is known that developing countries spend some $200 billion a year, representing some 20 per cent of their budget, on armaments. admittedly, the security needs of states vary considerably according to geopolitical factors, but this expenditure still represents a staggering figure. it is a waste of resources when one considers that there is a negative outflow of some $50 billion a year from developing nations for debt servicing alone. such a situation cannot be allowed to continue. the solution is as much a political as an economic one. earlier this year, at its eighteenth special session, the general assembly adopted the declaration on international economic co-operation, in particular the revitalisation of economic growth and development of the developing countries, which we believe should provide the appropriate guidance for the drawing-up and adoption at the assembly of an international development strategy in the context of the fourth development decade. as the world economy becomes more integrated, the international community needs a cohesive framework within which to address global economic issues. in this regard the outcome of the united nations conference on the least developed countries in paris is particularly important. he welcome the adoption of a new programme of action for debt relief and the other concrete measures taken to alleviate the economic plight of the least developed countries. the least developed countries require, in addition better opportunities for trade diversification and preferential access to markets and accrued capital investments. that is the only way they can overcome severe structural problems, develop their human resources and achieve a sustainable rate of growth. the united nations also hosted in june this year a meeting on island developing countries organised by the united nations conference on trade and development (uhctad). small island states belonging mostly to the category of least developed countries have intrinsic disabilities which severely contain their already limited range of development options in an unfavourable economic climate. this fact has unfortunately not been fully acknowledged yet. we must therefore pursue our efforts in this direction through closer exchanges and co-operation between various island groups, whose importance in different regions of the world have so far been under-estimated. i am aware that your country, mr. president, has taken the initiative of organising another meeting of this kind for next year, and is playing an important role in improving contacts between small, island states hampered by remoteness and isolation. free trade is the cornerstone of co-operation. for small, island nations which are economically interdependent and extremely vulnerable to external factors, the development of a more open, viable and durable multilateral trading system is essential. so too is a stable economic environment. the uruguay sound was launched to address serious concerns in this area. the general liberalisation of trade in recent years has been persistently undermined by protectionism and a weakening of regulations of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt). developing countries is particular have suffered from this kind of instability and lack of discipline in the trading system. their efforts to implement the policy of trade and not aid are being thwarted by new forms of protectionism. trade in sectors such as textiles, clothing, footwear and agriculture, where developing countries have a comparative advantage, have been particularly subject to discriminatory treatment. such practices have impaired to a large extent the ability of developing countries to overcome their external-debt problems and promote their economic growth and development. the economies of the developing countries have further worsened in the wake of the gulf crisis. to avoid a catastrophic situation, the international community needs to make special efforts to come to the assistance of developing countries adversely affected by spiralling oil prices. in this connection, we make a special appeal for a multilateral relief fund to be set up to help offset the additional economic problems being suffered by these countries. another, equally vital series of negotiations will take place in 1992, during the united nations conference on environment and development. we hope that the obstacles we encounter will be overcome. the preparatory committee of the conference has already made extensive proposals to ensure fruitful discussions of a comprehensive agenda. there is a limit to the degree of ecological stress that our planet can endure. the irreversible damage inflicted every day on forests and in the atmosphere, the problem of marine pollution caused by excessive dumping of toxic industrial waste, and the overexploitation of fishery resources should help us draw the necessary lessons before it is too late. the success of the conference in drawing up strategies to stop and reverse the effects of environmental degradation will require political will and sacrifice, but on this depends the fate of our only planet earth. the united nations has in recent years faced increasingly daunting challenges, we are confident that, with the emergence of this era of historic challenges and changes, our organisation will continue to play an active role in achieving the objectives of our charter.",Mauritius,Africa,79.8686599731445,3.128220081329346,2651.0,8.0,0.0,8.0,3.017729158807997
BDI,45,1990,"i have the honour to convey to the president a message of peace, fraternity, friendship and wishes for every success at the forty-fifth session of the general assembly addressed to him by his excellency major pierre buyoya, president of the military committee for national salvation and president of the republic of burundi. on behalf of ray delegation i should also like to express to mr. de marco my sincere congratulations on his accession to preside over our work. we are convinced that thanks to his human qualities, his diplomatic experience and his dedication to the ideals of peace our deliberations will be crowned with success. in electing him president of the general assembly the international community has expressed its confidence in him and in his country, the republic of malta. i should also like to congratulate the other officers of the assembly who will, we are sure, spare no effort to assist him in the discharge of his lofty duties. i assure them that my delegation will give its full support in carrying out their mandate. i should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor, major-general joseph garba, for the highly praiseworthy work ho accomplished during his mandate. that outstanding diplomat is the pride of africa and of his country, nigeria. i should also like to express my warm thanks to the secretary-general, mr. javier peres de cuellar, for the many efforts, as positive as they are tireless, which he has constantly made throughout the past year for the maintenance of international peace and security. i take this opportunity to congratulate him most warmly on having accomplished the decolonisation of namibia, a friendly and fraternal country, which my delegation once again welcomes into the united nations family. i also welcome liechtenstein, which has just joined the great united nations family. before stating my country's views on some of the items of the agenda of this session, allow me to describe briefly the situation now obtaining in my country. on 3 september 1990 we celebrated the third anniversary of the proclamation of the third republic. over the past three years, the government of burundi has ceaselessly pursued the fundamental objectives it had set itself, namely, national unity, social justice and development for all in a genuine democracy. since its installation, the regime of the third republic has undertaken to strengthen unity and reconcile all the people of burundi, so that together- they can build the future of their country. the people of burundi aspire to live in peace, order and tranquillity. they wish to bequeath to their children a country of unity, from which hatred and vengeance have been banished. it was in that spirit that the head of state, in september 1938, appointed a commission to study the issue of national unity. the commission produced a report, which was made available to national and international public opinion on 13 may 1989. last year, i had the privilege of describing to you, from this very rostrum, the major outlines of that report, concerning which there has been a wide-ranging democratic debate throughout the country. i am pleased to be able to tell you that several of the report's recommendations have already been implemented. one of the main recommendations of the report was that a charter of national unity should be drafted. the commission was thus given a mandate to produce a draft charter, which all the people of burundi were invited to discuss. the debate took place at all levels and in all sectors of national life. many of our people, from diverse social and occupational backgrounds, responded to the appeal and studied the issue of national unity honestly and thoroughly. they also made useful suggestions concerning the content of the draft charter, which was published on 16 may 1980 and subjected to thorough scrutiny. it expounds fundamental human rights and freedoms - the right to life, freedom of expression and association, freedom of religion and the right to own property. the charter also includes a commitment by the people of burundi to reject violence, extermination and vengeance. it calls on the people of burundi to defend equality, justice and democracy. the publication of the draft charter is an important event for the people of burundi because our citizens are coming to realize more and more that unity is the basis for any political and social organization and for development. in submitting the draft charter of national unity, the head of state, major pierre buyoya, said: ""by adopting the charter, the people of burundi will have proclaimed its burundi identity before all other affiliations. it will have made the undertaking to fight for national unity in order to keep burundi a country of unity and peace"". the people of burundi will also have undertaken to fight for equality of all before the law and to reject unjustified generalizations and all forms of discrimination based on ethnicity, region and clan. to prepare for its future, the people of burundi must stress the spirit of forgiveness and reconciliation and scrupulously respect the right to life. the charter will be a pact among all the people of burundi. it will be the basic text and the foundation of the definitive institutions which will set all the burundi people on the democratic road. when the charter was published, on 16 may 1990, the head of state announced the main deadlines in the country's political calendar. at the end of this year, the uproma party - the union for national progress - will hold an extraordinary congress, expanded to include all the representative forces in the country, in order to adopt the draft charter of national unity and also the charter of economic and social development. the congress will set up a party central committee to replace the military committee for national salvation, which was installed when the third republic came into being. two months later, the burundi people will proceed by referendum to adopt the draft charter of national unity. immediately thereafter, a constitutional commission will be set up, with a mandate to develop a draft constitution, which will also be adopted by referendum. on that occasion the burundi people will, in complete freedom, choose the form of political organization it prefers. the institutions which will be set up will thus meet the people's deepest aspirations. the people will exercise its sovereign choice between a single-party and a multiparty system. the people of burundi intend to establish a democracy which will ensure peace and unity, leading to development for all without distinction. we do not want to create institutions in haste, for they might not reflect the aspirations of the burundi people. we call on our neighbours, on all friendly countries and on all our partners to continue to show support for us. we believe that peace and development in burundi will be a contribution to the struggle for peace and prosperity throughout the world. unity and development are goals which are intimately linked. the political reforms have been accompanied by economic reforms aimed at restoring the major macroeconomic balances, at reviving economic growth and at raising standards of living. the economic reforms are part of a structural-adjustment programme which has support from the international monetary fund (imf), the world bank and our other partners. adopting the structural-adjustment programmes has not affected burundi's development guidelines. it has been a tool for good management in implementing the country's priorities for economic and social development. even if we have been unable to achieve all the expected results, over the past two years we have been seeing an improvement in the balance of payments, an increase in tax revenue, in administrative dues collected and, generally speaking, in control over public expenditure. in order to reduce the social cost of the reforms, a programme to cover the social dimension of the structural adjustment was introduced. the reforms are continuing despite the difficult circumstances, which include the debt burden, the collapse in the market for coffee - our main export - and the increase in the price of oil. ws are convinced that increased support from our friends is indispensable if we are to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves. the international community is well aware that underdevelopment is one of the factors creating divisions and conflicts between peoples. we should like to take this opportunity to thank the friendly countries and organisations which have given us their constant support in this process of economic reform. one of the recommendations of the commission established to study the question of national unity was that an economic and social council should be set up. that consultative body, answerable to the head of state, was set up on 15 march 1990 with the mission of studying and analysing national economic and social problems and providing advice and suggestions on policy directions to the executive branch. this council is an ideal framework for in-depth thought on economic questions in our country. the establishment of the economic and social council is another step along the road of openness and democracy. we consider that the major economic and social questions in our country are challenges and, in this respect, are of concern to everyone. their solution thus requires the contribution of the national community as a whole through free and open thinking and debate. this is why the composition of the council was motivated by a desire for broad representation without discrimination, be it regional, ethnic and, even less, socio-professional. true to its policy of national unity to ensure the well-being of all the people of burundi, the head of state met up a national security council in july 1990. in fact, the security of a country cannot be the business of the police or the army. it is a responsibility that lies with all citizens. the security council comes within a comprehensive framework to build and consolidate the unity of the people of burundi. it is entrusted with defining and orienting the national security policy. for the first time in the history of our country, a body has been set up which will consider problems of security within a more comprehensive framework, one that is more open and more transparent. the security council, comprising eminent state personalities, will strive to restore and reaffirm confidence among the people of burundi. it will be called upon to make decisions in peacetime and, above all, in times of crisis. the council will help to revive feelings of unity and solidarity in times of happiness, as well as in times of misfortune, since it is true that, in order to overcome any crisis, above all we must have unity. the establishment of this council follows the same logic as that which led to the establishment of the unity government in october 1988, the appointment of a national commission to study the question of national unity, and the establishment of the economic and social council. despite the priority given to our domestic policy, burundi is convinced that our era is one in which interdependence and solidarity among nations, regions and peoples are indispensable. the common destiny of mankind in the face of the many dangers threatening all countries, large or snail, rich or poor, has become an indisputable reality, like the fundamental aspirations of all nations and of all peoples for well-being and peace. detente and the desire for peace, which now characterise international relations, are very encouraging for the international community as a whole. the improvement in soviet-american relations, for the entire world, contains great hops for stability in that it offers the prospect for peace and fruitful co-operation. moreover, my country continues to follow with particular attention the rapid changes occurring in eastern and central europe, the major progress achieved by the european economic community towards establishing a single market and political union and the new prospects for integration for that continent. the reunification of the two germanys is an historic event at the end of the twentieth century. it marks the end of a period of antagonism between blocs and opens up better prospects for peace in the world. this gives us great pleasure, and we hope that the german nation, which will now play a decisive role in the european system, will use its economic power to strengthen north-south co-operation, as we all hope. we are being confronted with a unique historic opportunity, towards which all efforts should converge in order to consolidate the favourable trends and make then irreversible, thus giving a new dimension to relations among states. lately, detente and dialogue in international relations have been essential elements, which have made it possible to take dynamic and concrete initiatives to facilitate the settlement of many conflicts. in southern africa, the namibian people have seen their efforts of many years crowned by their independence on 21 march 1990. we must now reflect on the quality assistance to be given to the young namibian nation so as to enable it to ensure its full independence in the best possible conditions. the peace process that has been developing for some time in angola and mozambique, thanks to the efforts made by the various messengers of peace, must be strengthened and encouraged in order to enable these two countries to preserve their sovereignty and to devote themselves fully to economic development activities. as to south africa, my delegation reaffirms its condemnation of the hateful system of apartheid. however, the various measures taken by the government of south africa encourage a certain optimism. moreover, the agreement of 7 august 1990 between the government of south africa and the african national congress of south africa (amc) are of great importance on the road towards true peace. while pleased with this step, burundi calls for talks to continue in order to achieve an agreement aimed at dismantling apartheid fully, thus establishing a multiracial and democratic society. finally, we call on our black brothers of south africa to halt all acts of violence and to unite in order to wage the last battle against apartheid more effectively. the international community, for its part, must maintain its support for the amc and for the other movements involved in the struggle for a more just society. still on africa, the question of western sahara has made encouraging progress. can we finally hops that, after the report of the secretary-general of the united nations on western sahara, published on 20 june, the best possible conditions will be found to organise a referendum so as to implement the joint peace plan of the united nations and the organisation of african unity for the settlement of this question? as to the middle east, we must mobilize to seek peace in this region together. burundi supports and encourages all initiatives taken to restore peace among the palestinian and israeli peoples. however, we regret the lack o real progress, owing to the rejection of the various peace initiatives by one of the parties to the conflict. burundi hopes that the palestinians and the israelis will soon meet at an international conference to discuss the terms for the establishment of the long-awaited peace. it is high time that the pressures and sufferings of the populations of the occupied arab territories were halted, and that the palestinian people regained its inalienable right to a sovereign state in secure and internationally recognized borders. as to the annexation of kuwait by iraq, my delegation deplores and condemns the violation by the occupying power of the rules of international law governing the respect of territorial integrity, non-interference in the internal affairs of other states and non-use of force in the settlement of disputes. the invasion and occupation of small states by large ones cannot be tolerated in our era. the invasion of kuwait by iraq is all the more serious in that it complicates a situation which is already tense in the region, and as it threatens to provoke a conflict with incalculable consequences. at this time, the poor non-oil-producing countries are finding themselves in an extremely grave crisis, which is destroying all their development efforts. the measures envisaged for countries considered to be the most affected should be extended to the poorest countries, where the crisis has worsened an already bad economic situation. burundi, like other peace-loving nations, calls on iraq to withdraw its forces from kuwait so that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that state may be restored. once again, the united nations is being called upon to play fully its role to ensure respect for the principles of law contained in the charter. as regards cambodia, burundi expresses its satisfaction with the agreement between the parties to the conflict for the framework proposed by the five permanent members of the security council for a comprehensive and lasting political settlement to the question. moreover, we urge them to strengthen the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation and to avoid fratricidal confrontation. with respect to the korean peninsula, my country supports the principle of peaceful reunification and encourages the two parties to continue the dialogue which has been begun so that this process may be rapidly concluded. the korean people must regain its sovereignty, its dignity and its unity. it is imperative that the work of reunification of the korean nation and of its people, which share a culture forged by a common thousand-year-old history, be achieved through a reduction of tension in the region by the demolition of the wall which divides them so that an opening may take place between the north and the south. thus, we may soon welcome among the family of the united nations a single korean nation. in central america, the results of the tela agreements are very encouraging. we hope that the normalization of relations among the countries of the region will become irreversible. this is a very propitious opportunity for my delegation to express once again to the assembly its admiration for the steadily growing role played by the united nations in the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts under the impetus of its tireless secretary-general. the entire world cannot but be pleased with these encouraging political results, which have strengthened our organization. however, these results should not hide the economic malaise which, in the near future, could jeopardize the delicate balance that the world has just regained with difficulty. in fact, in our developing countries the continuing drop in commodity prices, the dizzying escalation in the prices of manufactured goods, the increasingly heavy burden of external debt, the rise in interest rates and the reverse in the flow of our resources are challenges which are destroying our development efforts and are obstacles that we must overcome in order to ensure harmonious and sustained development. we must find increased agreement in the efforts of governments of the international community. in this respect, it should be possible to mobilize more effectively the resources necessary for a more complete and more general development, particularly through the direct support of existing regional economic groups. these groups, in our view, are the realistic way to economic development. with respect to the domestic field, many developing countries, in co-operation with multilateral financing and development institutions, have made courageous efforts to adjust their economies. in the face of an unstable and risky economic and environment, it is becoming increasingly difficult to envisage a better tomorrow. in the short term, the results achieved by these adjustment policies can be summed up in terms of sacrifice and privation. international assistance is urgently needed to reverse the trend towards the impoverishment of a large part of humanity and to stimulate their economic growth. for my delegation, development assistance seems to be a moral duty, based on human solidarity which refuses to let millions of human beings die from the ills which underdevelopment has created. in africa, for example, in the 1980s, as recognised quite recently by the heads of state and government who met in addis ababa for the summit of the organization of african unity, most of the means of production and infrastructures have been constantly deteriorating. the per capita income of populations has fallen considerably, and resources devoted to public health, housing, education and other social services have been reduced, leading to a deterioration in the living standards of our populations. we thus hope that the debate in this assembly will lead to concrete results and will meet the urgent needs for development. the united nations, we are sure, will achieve these results. proof of this is the final declaration of the second united nations conference of least developed countries, adopted unanimously last month. we call on the developed countries to uphold their commitments to support the development efforts made by our countries. among the diplomatic events to which my country attaches the greatest importance is the united nations conference on environment and development, to be held in brazil in less than two years. the present political climate is pushing further and further back the nuclear threat, but the violence of man against nature is also a grave threat to survival. that conference will be an important stage in the drafting of a common policy for eliminating imbalances and promoting true world co-operation in order to preserve the environment, the common home of the whole of mankind. my delegation would like to stress most strongly its desire to see the development dimension given the same importance as that given to the environment dimension. we are pleased with the increasing recognition of this view by the international community and we hope that the various preparatory sessions of that conference will draft the best possible strategies for success. we hope that this conference will result not only in a clear and unconditional policy for preserving the environment, but that it will also encourage the adoption by developed countries of policies that will promote the growth of a world economy compatible with the global objectives and major imperatives for development. apart from the fears created by the deterioration of our environment, there are scourges such as drugs that no less seriously undermine our societies. we are pleased with the determination with which the fight against drugs has been carried out, but we recall that, in order to ensure victory, we must not neglect or underestimate the importance of a single front. we must show unceasing and unfailing solidarity. it is customary to talk a great deal about questions of human rights is all their aspects both civil and political. in the view of my country, human rights should be understood in a really global fashion, including economic, social . cultural rights, without forgetting the right to development. the world summit for children, held here in new york on 29 and 30 september last, showed that on this place, which we so strongly desire to preserve from all scourges, children are the actors of tomorrow. in his message to the summit meeting, major pierre buyoya, president of the republic of burundi, said: ""the world summit for children is appropriate at this time because the care and protection of children have become a moral duty rooted within wisdom and the culture of our societies. nevertheless, present problems such as war, violence, underdevelopment, indebtedness and degradation of the environment may distract the attention of leaders and political decision-makers with regard to the special nature of children and their decisive role in the future of the world."" burundi, which has already ratified the convention on the rights of the child, has solemnly undertaken to do everything possible to ensure the support end implementation of the recommendations contained in the declaration and the plan of action adopted by the world leaders at the world summit for children, our organisation has thus taken on additional step on the road towards creating a world where we must safeguard our achievements for future generations.",Burundi,Africa,37.3847198486328,3.35932993888855,3964.0,11.0,0.0,11.0,2.7749747729566097
ZWE,47,1992,"i should like, at the outset to congratulate his excellency mr. stoyan ganev, deputy prime minister and foreign minister of bulgaria, on his unanimous election to the presidency of the general assembly of the united nations at its the forty-seventh session. his election is recognition of his diplomatic skills and the respect for international law in his country. we are confident that the international community will benefit from his presidency. i also take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to his predecessor. his excellency ambassador samir shihabi of saudi arabia, who diligently presided over the general assembly at its forty-sixth session in an exemplary manner. we thank him for his efforts. the secretary-general of the united nations, mr. boutros boutros-ghali, has been at the helm of our organization for nearly a year now. we have already appreciated his style of work and the vigorous responses to the various crises that have beset the international community. we want to reiterate our confidence in his work and our continuing support for his leadership. i welcome into our midst, as others before me have done, the 12 new members of the united nations. their admission draws the united nations closer to the realization of the principle of universality of membership. this development is particularly welcome at this time, when a rejuvenated and vigorous united nations is closely involved in the resolution of many conflicts and crises around the world. it makes the pronouncements and actions of the world body that much more effective. it has now become clear to all that the end of the cold war has not been a panacea for the world's ills, especially the ills of third world countries. in some areas, and in some respects, these problems have been compounded by the upsurge in intense nationalism and new brands of religion. the end of the cold war has not yet brought tangible results and change for the palestinian people in the middle east, the black majority in south africa, or peace to the peoples of afghanistan, cambodia, the western sahara and many other areas of conflict in the world. however, new and determined efforts are being made to resolve some of these problems peacefully, and we hope that these efforts will succeed. the tenth summit of the non-aligned movement, held recently in indonesia, drew attention to the failure of all the multilateral talks aimed at narrowing the gap between developed and third world countries. in many areas, this economic gap has widened. the summit confirmed the validity of the movement in the current international situation, but it urged its members both to join hands in fighting the common economic and financial problems of the south and to promote economic cooperation among members of the south themselves. the fast-growing economies of south-east asian countries have shown the capacity for intra-regional cooperation among developing countries and what can be achieved. in the place of cold-war issues, the movement has put economic and financial matters on its agenda, and we hope that these will be tackled very forcefully over the next three years. in our region of southern africa, our economic problems have been compounded by the very severe drought we are all facing. in the past, we used to export large quantities of white maize, but this year we have had to import 13 million tons of grain alone. although the states in the region are fully cooperating in the areas of transport and energy supply, other areas of our cooperation would be greatly increased were the evil apartheid system in south africa brought to an end and a non-racial and democratic system established in that country. the regime of president f. w. de klerk which has been commented upon by a number of speakers has put the brakes on the transition process that was being discussed at the convention for a democratic south africa (copesa). it has also very effectively undermined the entire process by condoning and abetting the escalating violence against innocent black people and demonstrators. mr. de klerk has lost credibility in the eyes of the international community. he must take steps now to release all political prisoners; we are told there are 140 prisoners still languishing in jail. he must abandon or close down the single men's hostels, which are being used by armed gangs as camps. he must forbid the carrying of any weapon for any purpose in public places. he should disband all extraterritorial battalions, such as koevoet and battalions 31 and 32; in fact, he should ban all private armies and militia units. these are not drastic measures by any means. they are the minimum steps that must be taken to level the playing field so that all south african political parties and teams can play on it. the current problems of prisoners, hostels, weapons and private militias are a direct consequence of the evil system of apartheid itself, which the international community has described as a crime against humanity. we must stress that that system has not yet ended, although some bold steps have been taken in the last two years towards removing it. but it is still there. we commend the role the international community has played, and continues to play, in south africa in line with security council resolution 765 (1992) of 16 july 1992. it is still our belief that to deal adequately with the situation of violence in the country a substantial number of observers many more than the current 50 or so - should be dispatched to the country so that they cover all potential flash points. only a credible and effective international presence can prevent the violence and restore the confidence among the parties in south africa that is necessary for successful negotiations. it has become obvious that the international community has made the greatest headway on the south african issue when it has acted in unison. we need unity-in-action from the international community. the de klerk government must come out unequivocally on the side of majority rule as understood by all civilised nations, without any conditions or vetoes for minorities. the regime's primary responsibility is to provide security and safety for all south africans, and therefore it needs to take decisive action not only for the protection of all citizens of the country, as i indicated earlier, but also to carry forward the current process of eliminating apartheid through peaceful means. developments elsewhere in our region give much greater cause for hope, but the peace processes in question need to be carefully nurtured if success is to be guaranteed. in angola adequate preparations appear to have been made for the general elections that are to take place in the next few days. the vice-minister for foreign affairs of angola gave a detailed account of the arrangements that have been made for the elections in that country. the angolan people, he indicated, will be given an opportunity to elect a government of their choice. the greatest praise for this achievement must go to the angolan people themselves, who have shown great maturity and patriotism in the face of difficulties and mutual suspicions nurtured by 16 years of war. some praise must, however, also go to the united nations, which has steadfastly supported the angolan peace process, particularly through the deployment of the united nations angola verification mission (unavem ii), a peace-keeping operation in which my country, zimbabwe, is also playing a modest part. we are glad that the problems that had arisen with regard to the registration of voters, particularly logistical problems of access by voter-registration officials to various parts of the country, have now been resolved and that incidents of violence in the electioneering process have not been allowed to get out of hand. we also commend the pledge by the main parties in the angolan elections that they will respect the poll result and that if they win they will endeavour to establish a government of national unity and reconciliation. the concept of bringing all sections of society into government is indeed an act of statesmanship that takes into account the traditions of the african people. with regard to mozambique, we believe that a comprehensive cease-fire will be signed on 1 october 1992. we hope that this solemn commitment will be upheld and respected by all the signatories and, in fact, by all the mozambican people. after so many years of fighting, mozambicans want peace, tranquillity and progress, but to achieve peace a lot of work still remains to be done. there is need for flexibility on both sides, and for active participation by all states in the region, including the republic of south africa, in the peace process. zimbabwe has done, and will continue to do, all in its power to help maintain the momentum and keep the peace process in mozambique moving forward. as all delegates are aware, the rome declaration envisages an eventual united nations monitoring role in mozambique's electoral process, and we trust that all states will support such an undertaking by this world body. the situation in somalia, to which many speakers have referred, is a cause of deep concern in my country; 2 million people may die and 5 million need food aid. the extent of the suffering, which is now labelled the world's worst human disaster, could have been greatly alleviated had the world body acted earlier and with speed. however, we commend the decisive steps that have now been taken by the security council, especially the decision to dispatch 3,500 troops to protect food shipments and distribution. my country is proud to be participating in this operation, which is aimed at averting a famine of genocidal dimensions in somalia. we urge the various clan militias in the country not to disrupt the united nations effort, but to engage in negotiations aimed at reuniting and bringing peace to their tortured people. the leaders of the three political factions in somalia must be condemned for intensifying civil strife in a society that is already ravaged by so much famine and drought. they should instead be unifying and reconciling their people, reconciling the nation, in order to enable it to withstand the drought more effectively. in west africa the continued elusiveness of a solution to the liberian conflict is also a cause of grave concern. we commend the efforts of the economic community of west african states (ecowas) governments to bring peace and democracy to liberia. fighting between rival factions in recent days may embroil forces of the ecowas cease-fire monitoring group (ecomog) in more fighting and make the whole situation intractable. we urge our liberian brothers to put the safety and future of their people and country before personal gain and aggrandizement, and we urge our ecowas brothers also to continue with their efforts in attempting to bring peace to liberia. the crisis in the middle east has dragged on for a long time, dating from the cold-war era. our hopes were raised that a solution would be found in the current round of peace talks that began with the madrid conference. we still place our hopes in that process, and hope that the advent of a labour government in israel will result in a more imaginative and flexible attitude that can lead to a solution adequately addressing the legitimate aspirations of the palestinian people. clearly, the new israeli government must accept the principle of the complete withdrawal of its troops of occupation from palestine and the assumption of full control by the palestinians over their own resources, including water resources, as fundamental to the resolution of the palestinian issue. further, it is important for the united nations to assume a central role in the peace process, particularly as its resolutions served as terms of reference for the madrid conference. there are many other areas of crisis and conflict that require, and are getting, the attention of this world body, such as cyprus, cambodia, afghanistan, western sahara and others. the united nations must continue to ensure that in western sahara, the referendum plan is carried out in a manner that reflects the genuine aspirations of the sahrawi people; that in cambodia, full and comprehensive implementation of the paris accords is achieved; that in cyprus, a solution that preserves the unity of the country and its sovereignty and territorial integrity is found; and that in afghanistan also, the unity of the country is ensured and peace realized. the most explosive areas in the whole world today, however, remain the countries of the former union of soviet socialist republics and the former socialist federal republic of yugoslavia, which have been the subject of much comment by earlier speakers. in these areas, once the communist parties that held power collapsed, the remaining, separate ethnic entities were engulfed in intense local tribalism and in an upsurge of religious fundamentalism. our experiences in africa reveal that social situations of tribalism and/or religious fundamentalism cannot be resolved simply by calling an election, or by using military force alone; what is often required is a deliberate act of national reconciliation that establishes a government of national unity and distributes power and influence to every segment of the society. this is a political game in which there should be no losers: the purpose of an election becomes that of establishing the relative strengths of the participating parties and therefore the weight or seats they should have in a government of national unity. in the case of yugoslavia, from the very beginning my delegation felt that when the upsurge of tribal feeling hit that unhappy land, a conference of national reconciliation should have been convened. if some tribes insisted on getting out of the federal arrangement, they should have been required to sign a treaty guaranteeing the rights of the minority tribes to power-sharing and to enforcement of full human rights within their own territories, because let us face it - the main problem in yugoslavia is the patchwork of tribal units that are spread throughout that land. we ourselves have never believed that the european economic community's policy of early recognition of croatia and slovenia on the one hand and the severe punishment of serbia and montenegro on the other would solve the problems of tribal and religious feelings in bosnia and herzegovina, where the numbers in the ethnic mix are almost equal. we strongly condemn the obnoxious policy of so-called ethnic cleansing by the competing tribes in bosnia and herzegovina. the expulsion or killing of any one person in the process of so-called cleansing does not solve any problem; instead, it creates a psychological, vicious circle of communal violence. however, when we discuss the question of yugoslavia in this world body soon, we would urge a word of caution: to seek reconciliation and not to ridicule any of the warring tribes of former yugoslavia. the fact that persons drawn from different ethnic, racial, religious, linguistic and cultural groups live together should be a point of strength rather than weakness; in fact, former yugoslavia used to pride itself on that very fact. here in the united states of america, the country draws much strength from the cultural diversity of its people, who live together happily under one political system. that is broadly what we should aim at in the context of the balkans. the subject of restructuring the united nations system has been on our agenda for some time now. my delegation put some specific proposals before the summit of world leaders held here last january. the thrust of our contribution was the need to democratize the international system and the empowerment of the voice of third world countries within that system. we are pleased that the secretary-general has followed up the work of that summit with a comprehensive statement entitled ""an agenda for peace"" (a/47/277). we agree with most of the well-thought-out conclusions and suggestions in the report; in particular, we agree with the emphasis he puts on democratic practices and the commitment to full human and political rights within our societies. on the subject of tribalism and nationalism, which we have been discussing, he says: ""if every ethnic, religious or linguistic group claimed statehood, there would be no limit to fragmentation, and peace, security and economic well-being for all would become ever more difficult to achieve"". (a/47/277, para. 17) we also endorse the recommendation that more should be done to assist the countries that become victims of economic sanctions applied by this world body against other states. a meaningful and fair programme and mode of compensation for victim states would encourage them to apply united nations-sponsored sanctions more faithfully, which would result in greater effectiveness of those sanctions. it is also our view that the united nations should have its own dedicated and committed armed units on a permanent basis, so that in its enforcement actions the world body acts as the world body, not as only some of its parts or some of its members. the charter itself provides for the united nations to function in that fashion, and we believe that it is time the relevant provisions in this regard were reactivated. given the centrality of the security council to the question of the maintenance of international peace and security, any discussion of security issues cannot be complete without a look at the procedures of that body itself. we are aware of the circumstances in which the power of veto was given to those who now possess it in the council. the point at issue now is whether arrangements that appeared fair or at least justifiable 47 years ago are still viable today. we believe this is an issue which needs rational discussion in which all states would participate equally and all views would be given a fair hearing. only such a fair exchange of views can result in the peaceful new world order that we are all seeking. needless to say, conflicts are not only the result of injustice within and among nations but also the result of poverty, want and despair. the past decade has seen a massive deterioration in the standards of living of peoples in the developing world. this poverty is traceable not only to the policies of individual third world governments but also to the capricious and pernicious international environment in which they operate: not only have the prices for raw materials - the mainstays of our economies - been seriously depressed throughout the past decade, but we have also faced extremely high interest rates and increased protectionism from the markets of developed countries. far from being recipients of capital, we have become net exporters of hard currency, and today we jointly labour under a foreign debt of some $1.3 trillion. some of us have, in addition to all this, suffered natural disasters such as the drought, to which i have referred, that is ravaging southern africa at the present time. poverty and want breed despair, and despair, of course, breeds conflict. if the international community is to address peace and security issues adequately, it needs to attend seriously to the causes of despair in the world today. there can be no human right greater than the right to food, the right to shelter and the right to life itself and, during life, the right to literacy. the world body and its specialized agencies must address these issues as a matter of urgency. in this regard, we are pleased at the plethora of projects now under way to make the united nations focus on issues of economic development and social and humanitarian issues, such as the nordic project. we believe the time has also come when a frank appraisal should be made of the global economy with a view to eliminating some of the built-in obstacles to growth for developing countries. i must return again to the theme of the movement of non-aligned countries, namely, how to close the widening economic gap between rich and poor nations. my delegation supports the convening of an international conference on social development, planned for 1994 or 1995. such a gathering would assist in defining clearly the basic needs of human beings on this earth in this nuclear age, needs which must be met in order for them to live a decent, satisfying and enriched life - in answer to the question. what does an ordinary human being need? and it would also map out a genuine path of development for third world countries in the south. the conference could play a very important part in showing the correct path to development. the paths that have been chosen for development have led us in different directions, and some of them have led us into culs-de-sac. we need to think deeper and to act more decisively in order to chart the correct path. to that extent, we strongly support the convening of the conference on social development. that should be the essence of the new world order to which we should all aspire. it should be an international order guided by the twin objectives of universal peace and security, on the one hand, and an improved quality of life for all the earth's inhabitants, on the other. it must also be an order characterized by justice and respect for international law. we third world countries should join enthusiastically in the promotion of the current decade of international law, because that is our only shield against the arbitrary actions of some big powers. our sovereignty and our national self-determination are deeply rooted in our political philosophies, of various kinds, but they are also anchored in the practice of international law. we should uphold that shield even more vigorously in the so-called new world order that is emerging. we should also uphold the charter of the united nations, which gives us some of the basic principles on which the international system has operated for so many years, nearly half a century. today we stand at a crossroads. the collapse of the old order gives us the rare opportunity to build something new in its place. shall we use this opportunity wisely, or not? history has taught us salutary lessons about the price mankind has had to pay for opportunities that are missed. in our deliberations in this forum and in others, we shall all help determine the shape of this new order that is coming. zimbabwe intends to participate, with others, actively in that debate to ensure that the much-heralded new world order will be a just, humane and enlightened one that will bring an improvement to the quality of life of all of humanity and provide for the basic needs of all human beings, and especially in our developing societies. the global community has the means and the capacity to provide for those basic needs.",Zimbabwe,Africa,83.512580871582,22.32221031188965,3793.0,11.0,0.0,11.0,2.9000790930661746
SYC,49,1994,"mr. president, may we congratulate mr. essy and wish him every possible success in exercising your mandate. seychelles would like to take this opportunity also to pay tribute to the secretary-general for the timely and judicious initiatives which he is constantly taking to promote peace, justice and development. we have gathered together to express the profound aspirations of the countries we represent. we all have our specific problems, our differences, our advantages and our handicaps. we all have many unresolved questions which stem from an international situation where the factors of political and economic instability are becoming increasingly frequent. the hesitations of a changing world tend to engender a feeling of pessimism, as we see contemporary history being made. between the industrially developed countries and those who are still marking time on the path to development, considerable barriers are blocking the road to sharing and to solidarity. we now see cruel dissensions arising among peoples that were previously bound by brotherhood. on the international scene, where we are witnessing a relentless confrontation between divergent interests, what place do we now give to the human dimension in relationships? 31 the end of this century is constantly being redefined by shocks, upheavals and various types of aggression born of negativism. more than ever, the success of our societies will depend on their capacity to absorb these shocks and, when there is nothing or little left to reinvest courage, determination and perseverance, in spite of sometimes terrible lack of understanding. but we also have to reinvest our capabilities, our funds, our means and our inborn willingness - in other words, unprecedented alliances have to be struck; for there is no longer time to philosophize about the world we shall bequeath to our great grandchildren. because of the unprecedented speeding up of history demographic, economic and social projections are becoming alarming in the medium term and no longer in the long term to which we had grown accustomed through our cozy selfishness or our defiance in the face of the unforeseeable. the phenomenon of exponential growth, which is widening gaps and encouraging rivalry, causes immediate rather than delayed reactions. we have become our own heirs! undoubtedly, there is more food for thought in this idea than in many statements. that illustrates to what extent our efforts must be both planned and creative. it also means that the immediate problem to be tackled is to define our priorities. here, my thinking is consonant with much of what has been said from this rostrum. certainly there is no lack of those who plead for a safer, healthier and more prosperous world. and so many conferences and seminars have echoed the same thought and have recalled this idea in their final documents. but we are aware that we have to go beyond this; hence, we are asking for action programmes which mobilize experience, energy and imagination. when continuity of effort is the key factor for success, we must expand the underpinnings of projects, assess results and renew assistance. in other words, what we are advocating is a definitely prescriptive approach, rather than the sort of analytical and descriptive exercises which has been the comfortable route of many international gatherings. if we are specific in defining the areas of our deliberations, then the ensuing action will necessarily be based on precise, useful and needed dynamics. this specificity, in the case of seychelles as in the case of more than 30 territories throughout the world, is, from the point of view of development, the dual constraint of geographic and demographic smallness and being an island. need we recall that the situation of small island states can, in many respects, provide indications as to the future of mankind. here, more than anywhere else, because of their vulnerability - whether it be due to the fragile ecosystems, the scant economic outlets or the lack of human resources - any dependence necessarily impacts upon the very future of the societies concerned. the global conference on the sustainable development of small island developing states, held in barbados, was indeed extremely beneficial for us all. it focused attention on the particular situation of those small states whose relatively high per capita income does not accurately reflect the reality of a situation which donors tend to tie to any aid for development. there is no doubt that that conference has been the source of great hope for the small island states. but some remain sceptical. in any case, we hope it will lead to a change in attitude on the part of the industrialized countries with respect to the unique situation of small developing island states, for it is the industrialized countries that will not only have to take up and enlarge upon the concerns of the small island states but also have to set in motion the strategies and the plans of action, which are the only real vehicles of change or of development. far be it from us to engage here in singling out the countries or international organizations concerned. however, two years after the rio summit we are very disappointed to see that the provisions of agenda 21 have rarely given rise to actions. does this mean that the concept of lasting and sustainable development is going to be severely compromised because of a lack of solidarity and international support and failure to respect commitments? let us get to the core of the problem. the harmonization of development policies and measures to protect the environment necessarily implies the definition of specific budgetary categories by priority, based on criteria of complementarity as between national effort and international efforts. this must be done free from any spirit of charity, as well as divorced from any evaluation based on per capita income. 32 let us not forget the backdrop to all this, the fact that in an era where everything occurs on a worldwide level the individual and collective responsibility of states calls for a global approach and equitable sharing of the cost and moral investment the environment represents. those responsibilities must be consciously assumed. all these are indicators that merit the attention - the unwavering attention - of decision-making bodies and international donors. in the past, many pronouncements have concluded on a hopeful note. joined together in an orchestral score, such notes would barely fill out a refrain in praise of development, one that, like a clear conscience, can often sound hollow. and yet we do not doubt the wisdom of our negotiating partners. there are surely some who would like to deal with questions of development from a dialectical viewpoint, but that is not true of us. if, for us, the essential thing is not to hesitate to be specific, we seek, in return, measures that will be real, meaningful and measurable. more generally, this could apply to the role women should play in the development process. this is an old debate. fortunately, the time is now past when women were viewed as non-conventional vehicles of progress. abolishing a principle, however, although paving the way for many improvements, can also generate a considerable potential for inertia, for the walls of hypocrisy, as we all know, are infinitely thick. it is not enough to quote some cases of women who are entrepreneurs or decision-makers, there have always been some effective women. the important thing is to modify behaviour and practices in real terms, at the societal level, and to analyse and transpose those models and ideas which have from time to time led to good results. that is what we expect from the beijing conference. where natural prerogative is concerned, we cannot of course speak of delegating authority but here too of equitable and responsible sharing. indeed, do we in fact have a choice? women must act within their communities as a proponent force that is open to change and capable of enriching the dynamic processes linked to changing values. it is impossible to give life without being concerned about survival, without being deeply aware of the changes that affect the individual or the society whenever they give rise to uncertainty and muddy the waters. humanism obviously owes a great debt to women. let us enrich it with our understanding. the womans identity is strong, but in many places there is still a lack of both recognition and expression, which are the foundations of her legitimacy. the ideal of legitimacy is a noble concept, in addition to being a good working notion. it is legitimate to look forward to the fulfilment of the promises made in solemn declarations; it is legitimate to expect that intentions so boldly and courageously stated will become promises, and it is also legitimate, when the urgency of the matter no longer leaves time for either declarations of intention or promises, to take action. consensus can come later. here, and in the same spirit, i should like to emphasize our interest in the proposal made by the director-general of the united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization (unesco) for swift humanitarian action - what we might call a ""spontaneous reaction"" - whenever called for. for here again we are talking about the legitimacy that endows the human entity with dignity and makes it worthy of respect. before concluding i should like to appeal to all countries and peoples present here to unite our efforts to take one large step towards world brotherhood. let us overturn the rigid barriers of all kinds of self-interest, let us be attentive to the needs of others and the future of our planet. let us shape our relationships for active solidarity and willing adherence to the principle of shared responsibility. on such vital questions there is no place for trite official statements. in coming decades, no one will be fooled by our unwillingness to engage, openly, fully and with determination, on the path of well-being, especially when it is the neediest of us who most require it. that is the price of true unity among nations. and we in seychelles harbor this desire to stand alongside all countries in concluding the unprecedented alliance that will guide the great ship of mankind towards the shores of the third millenium. it is up to us to ensure that those shores will be welcoming ones.",Seychelles,Africa,87.811149597168,8.479280471801758,1707.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
BFA,51,1996,"like some others present here, i too have had the opportunity to visit malaysia. malaysia is a great country, both in size and because of its outstanding successes in many areas. but it is a great country above all because of the quality of the women and men who govern it and who represent it on the international scene. ambassador razali ismail is without doubt one of its most eminent representatives. i am therefore convinced that he will preside over the work of our 51-year-old organization with great cheer and efficiency. i convey to him and to all the elected members of the bureau my congratulations and best wishes for success. i would also like to congratulate his predecessor, mr. diogo freitas do amaral, whose personal qualities and wealth of experience guided the work of the historic fiftieth session in an exemplary manner. we wish to convey our great gratitude to him. finally, i pay well-deserved tribute to the secretary- general, mr. boutros boutros-ghali, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen the role of the united nations and for the talent and tenacity with which he has guided the organization in these difficult times. in july 1996, the assembly of heads of state and government of the organization of african unity adopted in yaounde, cameroon, a declaration expressing its appreciation for and stressing the work done by mr. boutros boutros-ghali at the helm of the united nations. according to tradition and the rules of fairness, africa is entitled to a second mandate, which we hope will come about. the current trends on the international scene are disquieting. the sovereign equality of states and the principle of free trade are being damaged by unilateral measures, despite the fact that the general assembly of the united nations has reaffirmed these principles and the strict respect that should be accorded to them. moreover, we are facing a financial crisis that is essentially caused by the default on payments of assessed contributions due to the organization. the overwhelming majority of speakers who have preceded me have said that this practice is unacceptable, particularly on the part of those who have the capacity to pay. the procedures and decision-making process of the security council are still fairly opaque, despite some minor openings. the geographical origins of the permanent members run counter to the principle of equitable geographical distribution. the cause of this is historical, but this perception is now more widespread and stark, 51 years after the creation of the organization. yet today, through the deliberations and decisions of the security council, a veritable body of substantive international law, armed with sanctions and strewn with ad hoc tribunals, is emerging. after 51 years, the general assembly, the pedestal and guarantor of this structure, finds itself stripped of its powers and even of its functions. we cannot compare the general assembly to the security council but recent developments in these two bodies have accentuated their differences instead of emphasizing their complementarity, which is not a healthy situation. ironically, this situation coincides with the vehement, ongoing clamour for transparency and democracy everywhere. the reform of the united nations system is understood in various ways and we have yet to find the formula that can be supported by everyone. difficulties arise from the demands of some and the reluctance of others. clearly, reform must be a joint effort or it will not come about. we are concerned because all of these combined factors might encourage the disturbing trends to which i referred earlier. indeed, the financial situation of the united nations is central to the significance and future of our organization. an institution, a community of men and women, can be created by force can, for a time, be maintained by force but it is not force that makes them last. the idea of leadership is based on the ability to take decisions as well as on moral authority. moral authority is based on the ability to convince the majority in a lasting and complete way. to be followed without conviction is to run the risk of abandonment as soon as short cuts can be safely taken. the joint aspiration of the states members of the united nations was, is and must remain that of following a common path beneficial to all. it is no coincidence that in the charter, drafted at the end of a conflict in which powers imposed themselves on other powers, spirit and letter came together so that states large and small could feel involved as much in the responsibilities and decision- making as in the outcome. hence the principle of the sovereign equality of states, who assumed that, regardless of their size or importance, each should participate to the best of its ability in the functioning of the organization because, in this way, each worked equally to attain the principles and purposes of the charter. nor is it a coincidence that those which bore a greater burden in this respect were given a privilege in the security council, though it was to be exercised on behalf of all and for the benefit of all. what is happening nowadays? the united nations is unique. it is political. its role and its objectives are very special. how can we, therefore, try to see it as a company whose shareholders want to move it in a particular direction on the basis of the number of shares they hold? how could we continue to call ourselves united nations? the united nations has charge over destinies and people. it is also an institution that must be managed, but one in which everyone has a place. i have dwelt at length on this point because burkina faso is a community of men that understands, appreciates and supports the fact that the united nations is irreplaceable. it is an instrument which has no equal and we desire a world of fraternity and progress. africa is fighting for its development, although beset by crises and conflicts, such as those in liberia and burundi. in liberia, after the events of april 1996, the summit meeting of the committee of nine and a certain open-mindedness on the part of faction leaders calmed the situation, permitted the nomination of a new head of state in the person of ms. ruth perry, opened up prospects for the holding of elections. we encourage this trend. in burundi, a military coup detat swept away civilian rule, but the fraternal states of the subregion rejected fait accompli by ordering sanctions. we are therefore concerned by the situation in that country, which has already been traumatized by numerous ethnic conflicts. the international community should pay heed to that and provide resources. turning to the subject of taiwan, burkina faso would refer to the principle of universality in the matter of representation of 22 million people. we hope that an ad hoc committee will be established. poverty is on the rise. it is the result of the policies of the countries that control the markets. poverty is also the consequence of unequal distribution among the developing countries. in all cases, statements on both sides very often sound like incantations crashing against the wall of cold implacable reality. the idea of globalization, paradoxically, goes hand in hand with that of fragmentation, both political and economic. the world conferences held over the past six years have promoted the concept of partnership. we still need to give that concept real content and weight. unfortunately, we still possess neither of these despite real efforts by some partners of the north. invective, tirades of complaint and exhortations have not advanced the debate nor brought us closer to the right solutions. from 16 to 20 september 1996, we held the mid- term review of the united nations new agenda for the development of africa in the 1990s. we thank ambassador owada and his country, japan, for their 3 interest in the development of africa. however, we must acknowledge that the results of our negotiations with our other partners continue to fall short of our expectations, needs and priorities, although africa has largely met its commitments. the same goes for the mid-term review undertaken by the united nations childrens fund on the outcome of the world summit for children. increased resources are necessary and expected. self-control is the beginning of wisdom, but it is not enough without an enabling environment. from the discussions in the uruguay round to the creation of the world trade organization, this point is constantly being borne out. solidarity, the key word, must prevail and guide our actions if we want a global village, not just a series of enclaves that are more or less fortunate and in the long run condemned to mutual destruction. multilaterlism could prevent that fate, especially since we are now seeing that the state is surrendering control over certain elements of its sovereignty. everywhere, structures and organizations with varying degrees of legality are transcending states and establishing transnational networks and relations. it is therefore imperative that we keep pace with these trends and adapt now and in the future our special instrument, our common instrument: the united nations at the service of peoples. political will is what will make the difference.",Burkina Faso,Africa,12.8481702804565,1.440260052680969,1532.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.3054830287206267
ZAF,51,1996,"i should like first to extend warm congratulations to mr. razali ismail on his election to the presidency of the general assembly at its fifty-first session. we have no doubt that the session will benefit from his known skills as he discharges his responsibilities. i should also like to commend mr. diogo freitas do amaral for the excellent work done during his term of office. i should also like to express to the secretary-general, mr. boutros boutros-ghali, our continued confidence in his guidance of the organization. allow me at the outset of this, my first opportunity to speak before the general assembly, to express the deep gratitude and appreciation of the people and government of south africa for the decision taken by the assembly at the fiftieth session to relieve the new democratic government of south africa of the burden of the contribution to the united nations budget accumulated over the period of two decades when the apartheid regime was excluded from participating in the work of the general assembly. we recognize that that action involved considerable sacrifice, both for the united nations and for its member states, and that it was also consistent with the historic commitment of support for our struggle for democracy. south africa remains committed to achieving a world free of all weapons of mass destruction and to addressing the issue of the proliferation of conventional weapons. we therefore welcome the adoption of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty (ctbt), which we signed yesterday. our support for the ctbt as an instrument of disarmament and non-proliferation is based upon the view that this treaty is an integral part of a process which will lead to the full implementation of the nuclear-disarmament obligations set out in article vi of the treaty on the non- proliferation of nuclear weapons. an important milestone along this road was the adoption of the pelindaba treaty creating the african nuclear-weapon-free zone. this treaty will contribute greatly to measures aimed at achieving a world free from nuclear weapons. further steps are needed in the process to bring the world closer to the ultimate goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons. the next step is for african states to cooperate with parties to the other nuclear-weapon-free-zones in the pacific and latin american regions with a view to promoting a southern hemisphere-wide nuclear-weapon-free zone. we are heartened by the unprecedented step of four nuclear- weapon states signing the relevant protocols of the pelindaba treaty simultaneously with african states in april 1996, while the fifth has indicated that it will sign shortly. south africa, as stated previously in other forums, will also work for the commencement next year of negotiations in the conference on disarmament on a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. south africa also supports and will work for the establishment of an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament in the conference on disarmament. this committee can identify and negotiate the necessary steps by which we can achieve the ultimate goal of the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. we also look forward to the early ratification of the chemical weapons convention by those states that have not yet done so. it is not just the threat posed by all weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery that is of serious concern to my government, but also the build-up of conventional weapons beyond a level which can be considered legitimate for the purposes of self-defence. conventional weapons are, in fact, the cause of most of the deaths and suffering of millions of people in conflicts around the world today. my government would therefore like to encourage all states members of the united nations to support and participate in the united nations register of conventional arms, and lend active support to general assembly resolution 50/70 b on small arms and its panel of governmental experts mandated to assist the secretary- general to prepare a report on small arms. we would also encourage member states to support the worldwide efforts to secure the elimination of anti-personnel landmines. in order to alleviate the suffering caused by landmines, my government is committed to reinforcing international cooperation. as a country with advanced demining technology, we are pleased to be making a modest contribution to international efforts to unearth landmines. south africa will continue to cooperate in the various international forums dedicated to the non-proliferation of the technologies and equipment which 17 could be used in the development of weapons of mass destruction, and in discouraging any destabilizing build up of conventional weapons. our harrowing experience under the tyranny of apartheid has imposed a duty on us to place a high premium on the promotion of human rights. in this regard, our constitution contains an entrenched and fully justiciable bill of rights. in addition, plans are advanced for the establishment of an office on the status of women to provide a mechanism within the government to act as a monitor to ensure that a gender perspective is integrated into all publicly-funded policies and programmes. the south african government regards it as a priority to contribute to the efforts of the international community to combat the violation of human rights. in south africa, and in the region as a whole, processes of democratization have released a host of productive human and political resources. this has, in many ways, contributed to the achievement of peace, security and stability in our region. our vision for southern africa is one of the highest possible degree of economic cooperation, mutual assistance and the joint planning of regional development initiatives, leading to full economic integration. civil conflicts have ravaged many parts of africa. we welcome the positive developments which have taken place in rwanda and sierra leone. however, serious conflict persists in liberia, burundi and somalia. the south african government is committed to playing an active role in the ongoing efforts of the international community to assist the people of burundi to bring about lasting peace and national reconciliation. president mandela recently appointed a special representative for burundi, who has been given the task of searching for a viable solution in close coordination with other special representatives and with countries in the region. these efforts need to be supplemented by close cooperation between the organization of african unity (oau) and the united nations. at the same time, we are heartened by the progress, albeit tentative so far, towards peace in angola. representatives of member countries assembled here will agree that the people of angola deserve peace at last as an instrument for or rather, as an important ingredient of embarking on the road to sustainable economic development and social advancement. our government commends the efforts of the united nations, and especially those of the special representative of the secretary-general for angola, maitre alioune blondin beye, who has with tremendous patience and commitment guided the angolan peace process to the stage where it is today. we owe it to the people of angola to see this process through to its logical conclusion. through the organization of african unity (oau) mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution, member states of the oau are collectively committed to restoring peace and security on our continent. in support of the oau mechanism, we are pleased that the southern african development community has recently created an organ on politics, defence and security. these efforts reflect africas primary concern with issues of preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution. south africa welcomed the spirit of dialogue and realism that had begun to characterize the relations between israel and palestine and was hopeful that this positive development would gradually replace the centuries of conflict in the middle east. that hope was further reinforced by the declaration of principles on interim self-government arrangements reached in oslo. my government is concerned, however, that recent developments in the middle east are likely to reverse and jeopardize the peace process. we therefore urge all the players in the middle east to rise to the occasion and, in a spirit of reconciliation, to move steadfastly towards a lasting peace in the region. we are seriously concerned by the marginalization, particularly of african countries among the least- developed countries, from the process of globalization and liberalization. in this regard, closer attention should be given to the need to address the external debt burden of the least-developed countries, especially those in africa. problems associated with the debt burden and its servicing still persist and frustrate the rate at which the continent can extricate itself from the vicious cycle of poverty. we therefore welcome the mid-term review of the implementation of the united nations new agenda for the development of africa in the 1990s and recognize the importance of the united nations system-wide special initiative on africa, as well as the need to underpin its success through appropriate and adequate resources. in this context we also welcome the designation of 1996 as the international year for the eradication of poverty. we hope that the international community will 18 realize this objective in clear recognition of the challenges facing it. we welcome the world food summit, which is to convene in rome in november 1996 and which will afford the international community the opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to ensuring that poverty eradication strategies are fully integrated into all initiatives of the united nations system. my government is encouraged by the outcome of the united nations conference on human settlements (habitat ii). the results of the conference represent the collaborative efforts of the international community to develop a consensus view on the fundamental need to provide access to adequate shelter and infrastructure for all people. continued support for initiatives at the national and international level to realize and implement the necessary follow-up to habitat ii should now receive priority attention. it was an honour for south africa to host the ninth session of the united nations conference on trade and development (unctad) in april 1996. my government believes that the sound basis for cooperation established by unctad ix and the call for partnership for growth and development outlined in the midrand declaration must be carried forward and implemented through the general assembly and other forums. south africa is particularly keen to ensure that the framework which we adopted at midrand for the reform of unctad is translated into an effective facility for the developing world. south africa also wishes to underscore the fundamental importance of international cooperation in the environmental and development fields. sustained political commitment through global partnership remains essential for our continuing international cooperation efforts. it is for this reason that we believe that the 1997 special session of the general assembly will provide an excellent opportunity to reaffirm the principles and objectives of the rio declarations agenda 21. south africa, a country with a long coastline, has considerable interest in matters relating to the law of the sea. we are thus pleased that the united nations convention on the law of the sea and its implementing agreement have entered into force, and that the international sea-bed authority and related structures, of which south africa is proud to be a member, have been established. in my statement to the general assembly during the fiftieth session, i expressed the sincere hope that significant progress would be made in bringing about the establishment of an international criminal court. it is therefore gratifying to see that the preparatory committee on the establishment of an international criminal court, which was established during the fiftieth session, has made much progress in bringing this idea to fruition. what is now needed is to take this process forward by holding as soon as possible a diplomatic conference where the statute of the proposed court can be finalized. it is widely acknowledged that the favourable changes in the international climate are conducive to the reform and modernization of the united nations in order to prepare the organization to respond effectively to the challenges of the twenty-first century. i wish to recall that in his address on 23 october 1995 at the special commemorative meeting of the general assembly, president mandela, said: indeed the united nations has to reassess its role, redefine its profile and reshape its structures. it should truly reflect the diversity of our universe and ensure equity among the nations in the exercise of power within the system of international relations in general, and the security council in particular. (official records of the general assembly, fiftieth session, plenary meetings, 37th meeting, p. 6) in this regard, my delegation wishes to register its disappointment at the slow pace of advancement, with no end in sight to the deliberations of the working group on the question of equitable representation and increase in the membership of the security council and other matters relating to the security council. in this regard we support the recommendation in the report of the working group that the group should continue with its work. we would also urge member states to demonstrate flexibility and accommodation in their future deliberations and to display the necessary political will in order to reach a common understanding. in the declaration that the heads of state and government adopted on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the united nations on 24 october 1995, it was noted that in order to carry out its work effectively, the united nations must have adequate resources. 19 member states must meet, in full and on time, their obligation to bear the expenses of the organization, as apportioned by the general assembly. that apportionment should be established on the basis of criteria agreed to and considered to be fair by member states. (a/50/48, para. 15) my delegation has taken note of the progress of the working group on the financial situation in highlighting the problems facing the organization, and urges all member states to pay what is legally due as soon as possible in order that we may direct our energies to the real problems facing the world at this time. as we approach the twenty- first century, let us together resolve to redefine the role and shape of the united nations and render this institution better equipped to carry out the important task of advancing peace and development in the world.",South Africa,Africa,82.402099609375,5.04734992980957,2369.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.8442380751371886
MLI,53,1998,"allow me first of all, on behalf of the delegation of mali, to extend to mr. didier opertti my very warm congratulations on his outstanding election to guide the work of the fifty-third session of the general assembly. to ensure the success of the lofty mission entrusted to him, i wish to assure him that he will have the full and open cooperation of my countrys delegation. i would also like to congratulate his predecessor, mr. hennadiy udovenko, president of the general assembly at its fifty- second session, for the skill and ability with which he guided our work at a time when the reform of the united nations occupied a prominent place on the agenda of our organization. i also take this opportunity to convey to secretary- general kofi annan and his team all our gratitude for their tireless commitment in the service of the ideals of the united nations. the delegation of mali fully appreciates his programme of reforms designed to adapt our organization to the changing realities of the world. the fifty-third session of the general assembly has opened at a time when the growing impoverishment of 13 the poorest countries, the resurgence of hotbeds of tension and the difficulties incumbent in a stronger and more united cooperation are demonstrating that the rhythm of international change is unprecedented and requires our organizations attention. indeed, it would now appear that increased interdependence and the globalization of the economy are contributing heavily to the rise of new tensions and creating profound imbalances for the developing countries. the entire world, under the yoke of the logic of extreme competition, is going through a phase of profound confusion. everywhere, north and south, workers live under the remorseless threat of market rules, which grow murkier and more pitiless every day. financial crises are likely to undermine the developing countries efforts at economic reform. the imbalance between north and south is being exacerbated, the gaps are widening and differences becoming entrenched. characterized by a disparity in income, access to services and the possibility of living in dignity, poverty is growing in the developing countries and even spreading within the developed world. my delegation certainly believes that, if genuine social development and poverty reduction are to be achieved, strong economic growth is necessary and that the poorest countries must have access to markets in order to better participate, on a sustainable basis, in the world economy. in this respect, we welcome the secretary-generals suggestion that the developing countries be encouraged to participate more actively in the drafting of new international standards and in ensuring that these standards be transparent. specifically, non-tariff barriers should be eliminated for african and the least developed countries; vigorous measures should be adopted to ease the debt burden, whether by converting the public debt of the poorest countries into grants or by easing access to the debt initiative for the heavily indebted poor countries. but let us make no mistake: what is truly at stake today is a globalization focused on sustainable human development. the challenge at the end of this century and into the twenty-first will be to close the gap between north and south. in this respect, as the highest authorities have said; we are convinced that the history of humanity is the history of men. our constant quest for man is our roadmap for the worlds progress. our struggle will always be against a blind global market and in favour of sharing and solidarity. let us have economic growth, by all means, but let our work and its fruit be shared so as to end these inequalities. let us not close our eyes: where there is injustice and iniquity, there is no peace. respect for human and national rights is an integral factor for economic prosperity and social equity, as well as for promoting and maintaining peace and security. we can achieve such respect and right such imbalances if, through a renewed political dialogue undertaken in all responsibility and candour, we tackle the challenges with global vision and solidarity, in the conviction of true partnership and shared and equal responsibility in the building of a better world, a world of humanity. in this context, the major challenge facing the government of mali today is achieving sustainable human development through the struggle against poverty. this development hinges on a strengthened process of democratization, the rule of law and the implementation of decentralization, the vehicle for local development, designed and guided by the people. mali is rigorously pursuing a freely agreed policy of economic reform and entrenching its democracy. the positive results of these efforts, though fragile, are very encouraging, but there remain problems and difficulties which our programmes howsoever participatory will require major outside assistance, peace and stability in our subregion, africa and the world to solve. the same holds true for many countries, especially in africa, which, through the courageous reforms they have undertaken, are once again on the road to economic growth. like them, we intend to continue and consolidate our economic reforms with strong growth aimed at poverty reduction. the international community, however, must reverse the trend towards decreased official development assistance, which is essential to our basic minimum needs. we pay tribute to the tireless efforts of the united nations system and our development partners and urge an increase in official development assistance, without which we will scarcely enjoy the benefits of our reforms, undertaken with so much sacrifice in the fight against poverty. we also need a partnership aimed at strengthening our economic capacities to convert and market our commodities, facilitating their access to markets, promoting the resurgence of our private sectors and increasing flows of direct foreign investments. all this must take place in a more favourable economic 14 environment if unemployment and poverty are to be consistently reduced. the end of the cold war transformed the international context for united nations missions and activities. in the sphere of international peace and security, our organization is now taken up with domestic conflicts that often have serious international repercussions. unfortunately, in many cases, recent events allow us to assume that this type of conflict will continue to claim our attention. now that certain guiding principles in the area of peace and security are widely accepted, it is quite obvious that peacekeeping will remain our priority objective. it is therefore essential that we improve our preventive system and strengthen our institutions capacity to organize and lead these operations efficiently and successfully. for its part, mali will always fight for more peace, justice and solidarity throughout the world. for us, security and development are indissoluble. the grave crises shaking the world, and africa in particular, strengthen our conviction that the united nations, the organization of african unity (oau) and the subregional organizations must cooperate closely with one another in the search for effective early warning, conflict prevention and management, and peacekeeping mechanisms. in this framework, and with particular reference to africa, the prevention of conflicts and disarmament are of great concern. given all of the challenges of democracy, development and security that africa must meet, president alpha oumar konare of the republic of mali said a few weeks ago that: the development of the continent must be managed on new terms. the difficult situation of our continent has arisen almost everywhere as a result of democratic failures, which we must redress in our young and fragile democracies by an essential democratic commitment. we must promote pluralistic expression, the transfer of power and dialogue founded on law. we must eschew violence. the future of our continent does not lie in the emergence of ethnic republics, which will only lead us into general anarchy. it is important, we feel, not to deny, much less crush expressions of autonomy. they must be managed politically in a democratic context of the basic transfer of power and the emergence of local power with a view towards regional integration. thirty-eight years after the independence won in 1960, there is no question of redrawing the borders inherited from colonialism, but nothing today can justify border conflicts. we must be able to settle all border disputes politically. it is essential today that any ill-defined border be corrected in serenity, not in the heat of tension. the oaus mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution should be able to speed that forward. at a time when everyone is welcoming integration, borders must have a different meaning. they must be managed as border countries, joint areas and shared space. president konare also said that: post-election periods are also increasingly becoming times of conflict. this must be prevented by the proper preparation for elections, because some recent incidents of electoral challenge have threatened democracy. people must know that the only access to power is through the ballot box, whence all legitimacy flows. everyone must participate. we must therefore seek to control electoral challenges without ever endangering pluralistic expression and the transfer of power. strength must always reside in law and right the whole law and right and nothing but law and right and oppose any impulse to disorder and violence. in the view of the president of the republic of mali, africa can no longer be managed as it has been since 1960. a new africa is on the move, an africa which wishes to define its future and take responsibility for its own development; which is searching for solidarity, not alms; which is responsible and confident. it is an africa once and for all on its own feet, a democratic africa. that africa more than ever needs security and peace. to have that security and peace, africa must, like the rest of the world, be free from weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons, particularly light weapons. with regard to disarmament, mali hails the decisions of the review and extension conference of the parties to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons (npt), in particular on the treatys permanent extension. 15 we also hail the entry into force on 29 april 1997 of the chemical weapons convention and the progress in negotiations regarding the biological weapons convention. we warmly welcome the coming entry into force of the convention on anti-personnel landmines. mali, which ratified this convention early on, began last may destroying its stocks, which malis army had never used. while welcoming also the notable progress made on instruments regarding weapons of mass destruction, mali is deeply concerned about conventional weapons, which remain an area so far unexplored and not subject to international norms. recent conflicts, particularly in africa, which have claimed so many human lives, are fuelled not by weapons of mass destruction, but by light weapons. that is why my country, together with the united nations and the countries of the west african subregion, has undertaken specific initiatives to counter this phenomenon. we are pleased by the welcome given to president konares initiative regarding the moratorium on the import, export and production of light weapons by the economic community of west african states (ecowas), and more recently by the organization of african unity during the ouagadougou summit and by the non-aligned movement at the durban summit. but it is important now to go further to reduce and contain the threat of the proliferation of light weapons. this moratorium is in essence a confidence- building measure, aiming over the long term to strengthen the ability of the governments involved to exert stricter control over the illegal traffic in light weapons. here we wish to pay tribute to the far-sightedness and responsible commitment of the ecowas countries, which plan to announce a moratorium soon. this will be a precedent demonstrating africas clear will to prevent conflicts by exerting pressure on the means which incite and fuel them. the international community must keep up the momentum by mobilizing around the issue of light weapons, supporting the moratorium and making it effective by implementing a programme of coordination and assistance for security and development, which underpin the moratorium and help to widen it. we are an active party, and we support the proposals that emerge daily for tracking the illegal traffic in light weapons and establishing a control mechanism. although it is a complex and difficult matter, we must work together energetically to perfect such a mechanism. there must be more support for resolution 52/38 c, regarding assistance to states for curbing the illicit traffic in small arms and collecting them, and states must demand more on this issue of the international community and the united nations, which we congratulate on the action already taken. we must show our commitment to make vigorous progress in creating a mechanism to curb this matter and, at the same time, actively support initiatives such as the moratorium, consciousness-raising and the mobilization of all state and non-state actors to better ensure peace and reduce the threat posed by this illegal proliferation to people, particularly women and children, and to states and democracy. on behalf of the delegation of mali, i would like once again to voice our solidarity with and compassion for all the peoples of the world who are still living in conflict situations. regarding the middle east, we are deeply concerned over the deadlock in the peace process and the policy of fait accompli aimed at changing the religious, civil and historic character of the holy city of al-quds. the agreements concluded on the basis of land for peace must be implemented. we reaffirm our unswerving support for the just struggle of the fraternal palestinian people to realize their legitimate right to self- determination and to establish an independent state. we remain convinced that in angola scrupulous respect for the lusaka protocol is the only path to lasting peace and reconciliation. i wish once again to honour the memory of matre alioune blondin beye, special representative of the secretary-general, and the seven members of his team who tragically perished on the road to peace in angola. we have continually voiced our grave concern about the suffering of the fraternal people of the libyan arab jamahiriya as a result of the embargo imposed on it. while noting recent events, we should like to recall the decision taken by the heads of state or government of the oau at their recent summit and to reaffirm that the time has come to end the suffering of the fraternal libyan people by lifting the embargo and finding a lasting solution. concerned about acts of terrorism, which we condemn in all its forms, mali firmly condemned the lethal attacks against diplomatic missions of the united states in dar-es-salaam and nairobi. we reiterate our condolences to the families of the victims and call for greater international cooperation to prevent and combat this threat. we also call for the convening of an 16 international conference on terrorism under the aegis of the united nations, whose exclusive competence in the area of international peace and security we need increasingly to reaffirm. i would like to conclude on the issue of the expansion of the security council. clearly this body, which was conceived in a context quite different from todays, cannot be left untouched in the course of reform. my delegation endorses the demands of africa for democratization and an equitable distribution of the two categories of seats, permanent and non-permanent, with all the prerogatives and powers that go with them. we are convinced that a restructured united nations, democratic and given essential powers, can help ensure a more orderly management of world affairs by eliminating the injustices, disparities and selfishness which threaten mankind, so that nations can finally, in a spirit of solidarity, devote their resources and their energy to the progress and development of mankind.",Mali,Africa,19.0449695587158,2.649590015411377,2610.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.5325670498084292
ZMB,54,1999,"i join other speakers who have already addressed the assembly, sir, in congratulating you on your well-deserved election as president of the general assembly at its fifty-fourth session. your unanimous election is a clear demonstration of the confidence this assembly has in you and in your country, namibia, with which my country enjoys very friendly and warm relations. it is especially significant that you come from namibia, a country whose independence stands as a crowning moment in our organizations support for the right of peoples under colonial and foreign domination to self-determination and independence. i am confident that, given your experience and diplomatic skills, you will guide the work of this session successfully. i wish to take this opportunity to commend your predecessor, his excellency mr. didier opertti of uruguay, for the able manner in which he presided over the fifty-third session. in the same vein, i would like to place on record my countrys deepest appreciation of the work of the secretary-general, his excellency mr. kofi annan, whose leadership is well respected and has given new impetus to the implementation of the united nations reform programme. 19 as you rightly observed in your statement to this assembly, sir, the fifty-fourth session is the last to be convened in the twentieth century, a century that saw the creation of the united nations from the ashes and ravages of the second world war. indeed, the world cannot but thank the founding fathers of our organization for their foresight and wisdom. the relevance of this organization has continued to grow since its inception, and is today exemplified by the universality of its membership, which has grown from the original 51 states in 1945 to the present 188 states. it goes without saying that since the membership of the united nations has been growing, there should have been a continuous and corresponding process of reform of the decision-making structures and processes of the organization in order to make the world body as representative as possible. it is a matter of considerable disappointment, however, that while reform of the administrative structures has, to a large degree, been accomplished, reform of the security council has not moved in tandem. as members are all aware, the creation of the united nations was intended to strengthen international peace and security. regrettably, a number of states continue to be threatened in our time by the dangerous proliferation of small arms and light weapons acquired by non-state entities. the continued proliferation and illegal transfer of small arms, among other factors, are responsible for the supply of the weapons being used in conflict situations across the african continent. i would therefore like to appeal to all member states to support and strengthen the united nations monitoring mechanisms on the transfer of these arms, particularly to non-state entities, in order to forestall this problem. related to the problem of small arms is the question of landmines planted in large tracts of land in many countries, rendering unusable what otherwise is productive land. the impact of landmines has also had a telling toll on the provision of social services in the affected countries. i equally appeal to member states, parties to the united nations convention on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction, to implement the maputo declaration and programme of action, adopted in may this year. only a strong and viable united nations can constitute the much-needed viable vehicle to achieve this goal. my delegation is therefore deeply concerned about the continued deterioration of the financial situation of the united nations. this situation is well known to all of us in this assembly, as it has been the focus of our discussions for the past five years. reform of the united nations will not be implemented effectively if the financial situation is not seriously addressed. it is the inescapable duty of all of us to honour our obligations by ensuring that we pay our assessed contributions in full, on time and without conditions. this will enable the organization to function smoothly and more effectively to execute the mandate we have entrusted to it. that among many other reasons is why we want to build strong economies in africa to enable us shoulder our obligations. but external debt remains both a burden and a major impediment to the development process of many developing countries, including my country, zambia. while we welcome the recent outcome of the group of eight meeting held in cologne, germany, on the heavily indebted poor countries debt (hipc) initiative, the measures for faster, broader and deeper debt relief, in our view, will not be sufficient to resolve the external debt problem of developing countries, especially the poorest among them, unless they are translated into real tangible, practical economic development programmes. it is the view of my government that the group of eight target for debt relief of about $100 billion for the poorest countries in the world, the majority of which are in africa, will have little effect on the problem unless the terms of the heavily indebted poor countries debt initiative are further revised in such a way as to make them more flexible and better tailored to suit the specific conditions of the targeted countries. many of us in the developing countries understand that, in order to survive and contribute positively in the global markets, we need to make our economies more competitive. in this regard, many of our countries have embarked on the implementation of structural adjustment programmes. our efforts are, however, hampered by the huge debt burden which takes away large amounts of resources from our countries through debt servicing. the declining levels of official development assistance and foreign direct investment to our countries, combined with the debt burden, have made economic reforms difficult and have slowed down the pace of economic growth and development. 20 the solution to this is for all concerned to approach the question of debt with open minds, with a view to finding a lasting solution to the problem. added to that problem is the spread of hiv/aids. this is a matter of grave concern to my country and to africa as a whole. this disease has continued to overwhelm the continent and to rob it of its meagre material and financial resources through devastation of its youthful and active population. it is therefore necessary for all humanity to rise to regard hiv/aids as a global problem and to act in unison. i therefore call upon the international community to redouble its efforts in fighting this scourge. let me take this opportunity to report to this body that last week, from 12 to 16 september 1999, zambia hosted the eleventh international conference on aids and sexually transmitted diseases in africa. the holding of that conference, which adopted a programme of action to fight the spread of this deadly disease in africa in the twenty- first century, is among other things a demonstration of the african continents commitment to fight against this deadly disease. it is my hope that the united nations will therefore embrace the outcome of the conference and provide the necessary leadership in the fight against this pandemic, which threatens the very survival of humankind. the aids problem deserves our collective moral and political will to combat it successfully. let me now turn to the phenomenon of the conflicts which have continued to bedevil africa. in our own southern african subregion, the conflicts in angola and the democratic republic of the congo are not only a threat to peace and security but have also been a major impediment to the economic development of the region. the resumption of hostilities in angola in december 1998, after four years of relative peace following the signing of the lusaka protocol, is regrettable. as the assembly is aware, this unfortunate state of affairs was occasioned by the intransigence of unita with regard to the implementation of the remaining tasks under the lusaka protocol. every effort should therefore be made to bring an end to the hostilities. with regard to the democratic republic of congo, the assembly will recall that on 2 august 1998 a conflict erupted in that country. in response to this serious development, a series of efforts by regional heads of state and the organization of african unity (oau) were immediately undertaken in search of a peaceful solution to the conflict. at the summit held at victoria falls, zimbabwe, from 7 to 8 september 1998, the regional heads of state mandated me to chair the regional mediation effort, with the assistance of oau. for a period of almost a year, i have, on behalf of our region, carried out exhaustive consultations inside and outside zambia, and convened a number of meetings at the level of experts and foreign affairs and defence ministers. let me state here that, right from the outset, regional leaders acknowledged the need to involve the congolese rebel movement in the mediation process to ensure that the outcome would be respected by and acceptable to all. the process initially engaged the rebel movement through a proximity mechanism. later, however, the rebels, who now included the movement for the liberation of the congo (mlc), were invited to participate directly in the peace talks with all the other parties to the conflict. on 10 july 1999, our perseverance on the regional and pan-african levels finally paid off when heads of state of all the six states parties to the conflict signed the ceasefire agreement in lusaka. unfortunately, a split in the congolese rally for democracy (rcd) the previous may led to differences over who should sign the agreement on behalf of the movement, which prevented them from appending their signature on that occasion. the other non-state party to the conflict, the mlc, also chose not to sign the agreement until the differences within the rcd were resolved. in order to secure the signatures of the rcd and the mlc, i was mandated by the regional heads of state to carry out further consultations with the two movements. i am pleased to inform the assembly that these efforts culminated in the signing of the ceasefire agreement by the mlc and the rcd on 1 august and 31 august 1999 respectively. allow me at this juncture to place on record my sincere appreciation for the cooperation and assistance i received from all my colleagues in the region and other african leaders, the united nations, oau and the southern african development community (sadc) in the execution of my mandate. the ceasefire agreement is an all-embracing document which addresses all aspects of the conflict, including the security concerns of all the countries neighbouring the democratic republic of the congo. i wish to inform the assembly that the implementation process of the agreement has already 21 begun in earnest. both the political committee and the joint military commission met on 2 and 3 september 1999 in lusaka with the participation of all members except the mlc, whose representatives were not able to travel to lusaka because of logistical constraints. among the issues considered by the meetings were: first, the formal installation of the chairman of the commission, brigadier-general rachid lallali, from algeria; the budget of the joint military commission; its structures; and its programme of work. the representative of oau briefed the meetings on oau activities in support of the peace process in the democratic republic of the congo, and the united nations representative briefed them on the relationship that is expected to prevail between the united nations and the joint military commission. the commission is scheduled to meet again on 10 october 1999. for peace to prevail in the democratic republic of congo, united nations support for the successful and comprehensive implementation of the ceasefire agreement is of paramount importance. for this reason, i wish to commend the secretary-general for his timely and positive response in sending a team of military liaison personnel to the region. the united nations must move more expeditiously than it has in the past if the job it does is to be commensurate with the tasks facing it in the field. to this end, i make an earnest appeal to the united nations that the organization, first, should authorize and support the deployment of a united nations peacekeeping force in the democratic republic of the congo with an appropriate mandate and, on an appropriate scale, based on the assessed needs on the ground; second, it should quickly dispatch the technical survey team to the democratic republic of the congo in addition to the team of military liaison personnel which has already been sent to that country and some of its neighbours; third, it should make available adequate resources for the peacekeeping mission; fourth, it should extend necessary and adequate support to facilitate the process of internal dialogue within the democratic republic of the congo; fifth, it should help in the mobilization of humanitarian assistance for the congolese refugees and internally displaced persons and facilitate their return and resettlement; and sixth, it should assist with resources for the economic reconstruction of the democratic republic of the congo. i need not remind the assembly of the solemn and important responsibility that the united nations bears on behalf of us all in the maintenance of international peace and security. it is, therefore, incumbent upon it to ensure that peace prevails in the democratic republic of the congo. to this end, it should learn from the lessons of the past and avoid costly mistakes. time is of the essence. what is equally of the essence is the need to address the root causes of the poverty confronting third world countries. the world community must tackle those root causes with speed and urgency. this session of the general assembly is meeting against a backdrop of growing tensions and armed conflicts, especially in the third world. these developments, coming towards the close of the twentieth century, are an indictment of the worlds global structures, which pose today, more than at any other time in history, a challenge to the very articles of faith upon which this organization was founded. the challenges cannot be wished away, nor can they be remedied by empty words. global poverty can be eradicated only with a concerted global programme. solving the issue of poverty would solve the problem of conflict and instability in the developing countries, and unless the world addresses these underlying causes of conflict, they will continue to be major sources of friction that will threaten and undermine international peace and security. events in the democratic republic of congo, in kosovo and now in east timor cannot but exert more pressure on the time and resources of the international community in general and particularly on the security council. but this is the mission of that world body: to attend to just such areas of conflict. admittedly, these are the most perilous times africa has ever faced. the multiple dangers of armed conflict and general political instability and the ever-growing danger posed by the hiv/aids pandemic can only call for concerted joint world efforts to help reduce the dangers that face africa and the world in general. there are various ways the world can come to the aid of africa, the most important of which are through aid and by creating conditions to make it possible for africa to trade with the international community on terms acceptable to all. africa is not asking for charity. no, africa is asking for genuine trade. africa is not asking for arms. no, africa is asking for fair and equitable recompense for its labour and resources. africa is not asking for pity, but genuine partnership based on mutual interests. 22 the relationship between poverty and political instability can no longer be in any way doubted. it is not good enough for the developed world to demand good governance an indefinable term while creating conditions of poverty by bad governance in the economic area. justice must prevail in our economic relations in order to lay the foundation for political and social justice. a start should now be made by reviewing the inequitable conditions imposed by the world trade organization, which, if maintained, will only ensure continued marginalization of third world countries, condemning them to poverty and further instability. i am quite aware that this forum may not be the appropriate one for addressing these issues, but it definitely has the right people to address the issues i have raised. therefore, my fervent prayer and hope is that we enter the new millennium with a renewed sense of unity of purpose to eradicate manifest global injustices and create a more equitable world where want will not create chaos and instability.",Zambia,Africa,68.0017929077148,1.77495002746582,2786.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.0768126346015794
MDG,55,2000,"i join all those who have welcomed the start of this fifty-fifth session of the general assembly. endorsing the millennium declaration of the millennium summit, i reiterate its message: let us the peoples of the united nations, faced with new challenges; brothers and sisters, partners linked by and in our support for the principles of our organization; with the expectations and constraints of our countries and peoples, yearning for peace and well- being; likewise facing the requirements of globalization and the manifold risks of conflict and marginalization be united in our action; let us say: we the peoples, inspired by new hope and new momentum, are for a better millennium. the delegation of madagascar congratulates you, mr. president, on your unanimous election to preside over the fifty-fifth session of the general assembly, a tribute both to your eminent diplomatic qualities and to your country, finland. we also pay tribute to mr. theo-ben gurirab, minister for foreign affairs of namibia, for the dedication and determination he displayed in presiding over the fifty-fourth session. we convey our congratulations to the secretary- general on his efforts he has made. his actions will benefit all the citizens of the world, who are all anxious to leave deprivation and poverty behind. i also take this opportunity to thank, from this rostrum, the united nations, for having adopted resolution 54/96 m of 14 march 2000, as well as all the countries and organizations that helped madagascar following the cyclone damage at the beginning of this year. with regard to restructuring the united nations, it is high time to enact such proposals as enlarging that cornerstone of collective peace that is the security council, streamlining the institutional structure to make it work better, and improving the financial structure with a view to a more equitable assessment of contributions. the power of the veto, which in itself constitutes a nullification of democracy, is incompatible with the founding principles of our organization. we know that, unfortunately, africa is a place of perpetual conflict, but a new impetus is manifesting itself in the search for lasting peace and reconciliation. with regard to the crisis in comoros, madagascar respects the position expressed by the organization for african unity (oau) at its thirty-sixth assembly of heads of state and government, held at lome. the antananarivo agreement of april 1999 remains the viable solution for bringing to an end the separatist crisis in anjouan, a crisis that was caused by the unconstitutionality of the regime currently in power. madagascar welcomes the efforts undertaken in burundi by president nelson mandela in his capacity 18 as mediator and facilitator. those efforts led to the signing of the arusha agreement, which we hope will allow the people of burundi to be united once again and to find peace and a new impetus for development. madagascar has long supported the struggle for self-determination of the sahraoui people and encourages the implementation of the united nations settlement plan as the only viable mechanism able to resolve the differences between the two parties. we welcome the outcome of the mediation efforts undertaken by president ismail omar guelleh of the republic of djibouti. thanks to those efforts, somalia is now beginning to find peace after more than a decade as a non-state. the election by the parliament in djibouti on 25 august 2000 of mr. abdikassim salad hassan as the new president is a step towards agreement. the people of somalia can now embark upon the process of restoring a state of law and civil peace through their own efforts and with the support of the international community. the desire in recent months for dialogue between the two koreas is encouraging. we welcome the summit conference held in pyongyang in june 2000 to discuss peaceful reunification that led to the signing of a joint north-south declaration. the family reunions that took place after half a century of separation were moving, and such meetings should be facilitated in the future. the decision to have the athletes of the north and south march together at the olympic games in sydney reflects a desire for reconciliation. madagascar is a peaceful island in the indian ocean. through me, my country reiterates its commitment to carrying out disarmament. we are counting on the implementation of the conventions prohibiting the production, proliferation and illicit sales of weapons of all kinds. on 25 august 1999, madagascar ratified the convention on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction. furthermore, our parliament's ratification process for the convention on biological and toxin weapons has begun. the proliferation of light weapons is one of the causes of the spread of conflict. my country therefore fully supports the convening in 2001 of an international conference under the auspices of the united nations on the illicit trafficking in light weapons in all its aspects. we pay tribute to the united nations peace volunteers who were victims of the recent terrorist act of aggression in west timor. we underscore the need for a joint strategy to deal with the current wave of violence. thus on 1 october 1999, madagascar signed the international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings. we look forward to a speedy conclusion of the draft convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. madagascar strongly supports the recommendations of the brahimi report and looks forward to their effective and speedy implementation so as to strengthen the peacekeeping capacity of our organization. we should stress the training, equipping and safety of peace volunteers. in this connection, the countries concerned and neighbouring states should make their contributions. adopting a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention is necessary because the problem needs to be tackled at the source. because we support democracy and the observance of human rights and the rights of citizens, madagascar joined in the decision taken at algiers in 1999 during the thirty-fifth oau assembly of heads of state and government to condemn the taking of power through unconstitutional means. a resolution of the thirty-sixth assembly, which was held at lome, urges the international community to condemn with one voice such anti-democratic practices and to enact sanctions against regimes that result from such practices. in the new millennium, let us ensure that children remain at the heart of our collective efforts. the twenty-fourth special session of the general assembly, on social development, held in june 2000 at geneva, emphasized the need to protect children, to inform them of their rights and to educate them fully in order to prepare them for citizenship. in order to mark the millennium summit, on 7 september 2000, madagascar signed optional protocols: one to the convention on the rights of the child, on the involvement of children in armed conflict, and another to the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. gender equality is for us an ongoing challenge. we condemn anything that runs counter to the progress of human beings, and we endorse the common struggle against social scourges and transnational 19 crime. we also wish to draw attention to the upsurge in such new areas of concern as sex tourism, paedophilia and the spread of hiv/aids. moreover, together with my sister ministers for social affairs, we spoke out in favour of a united struggle against those scourges in a letter to secretary-general kofi annan. what africa needs is easier access to care and medications. without opposing in any way the noble principle of freedom of thought and expression, we deplore the ill effects of any type of physical or moral aggression that is the result of the proliferation of cults, and media representations of obscene and immoral images. in this regard, legal instruments should be designed and implemented to create parameters for the electronic dissemination of material that poses a threat to morality. the signing by madagascar on 7 september last of the optional protocol to the convention on the rights of the child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography attests to our determination to work to safeguard the family unit and family values, which are a source of human dignity and which guarantee stable sustainable social development. in this context, madagascar adopted a law in 1999 which outlaws paedophilia. madagascar has also involved itself in the various stages of the negotiations that led to the adoption and the signing, on 14 september 2000, of the protocol on biosafety, the objective of which is to avert the dangers of using genetically modified substances. madagascar is also against any use of the research relating to the cloning of human beings. the economic and social difficulties facing my country are made worse by the uncertainty and changes in the international system. we must therefore strengthen international dialogue on the basis of partnership and shared responsibility. we are convinced that the promotion of a culture of peace and of mutual understanding will help bring about a harmonious world. accordingly, madagascar supports general assembly resolution 53/22, which proclaimed 2001 the united nations year of dialogue among civilizations. we hope that this session will outline strategies that are consonant with the requirements of development and of human security, in keeping with the plan of action proposed by the secretary-general in his report. an overall rethinking of development is necessary, because it is in everyone's interests to increase the purchasing power of the developing countries, so that in the near future they can become equal partners as well as a potential market. we deplore the glaring inequalities that exist today: our peoples are suffering from famine and malnutrition, whereas some others are enjoying amazing overproduction. this imbalance does nothing to promote commercial and financial flows. we therefore support the millennium summit declaration, which proposes the adoption of a duty-free admission policy for products exported by the developing countries, an increase in official development assistance, and the implementation of a debt relief and forgiveness programme. the holding in may 2001 of the third united nations conference on the least developed countries should lead to decisions that ultimately will help to eliminate the least-developed-country category from the scale of world economic values. accordingly, we support the principles of self- confidence and of mutual trust in the establishment of a monetary fund a development fund and a commodity price stabilization fund. this initiative seeks to both reduce the vulnerability of the developing countries to exogenous factors and to decrease the dependence of our economies on those of the developed countries. concerning africa specifically, regional and continental integration is vital in order to avoid marginalization. in this respect, madagascar signed the draft charter of the african union, which is the expression of the rebirth of a responsible, sovereign africa. important meetings await us in 2001, including the high-level intergovernmental meeting on financing for development and the special session to follow up on the world summit for children, which are all opportunities to give real meaning to the commitments undertaken during this millennium assembly. we have come to this historic session convinced that it will breathe new life into our organization and provide the basis for a dynamic for peace and 20 cooperation. we have come here because we have confidence in concerted action to meet today's challenges. we have come here because we have hope in a viable future free from need in a world of well- being and peace.",Madagascar,Africa,70.6861724853516,2.438689947128296,1894.0,11.0,0.0,11.0,5.807814149947202
SWZ,55,2000,"mr. president, on behalf of the delegation of his majesty king mswati iii, her majesty the indlovukazi and the government and the people of the kingdom of swaziland, may i extend hearty congratulations to mr. harri holkeri of the republic of finland on his election as president of this fifty-fifth session of the general assembly. i also wish to pay my country's rich tribute to mr. holkeri's predecessor, mr. theo-ben gurirab, minister for foreign affairs of the republic of namibia, for his exemplary stewardship of the last session of the general assembly. the kingdom of swaziland continues to develop quietly and peacefully, according to the wishes of our people. against a backdrop of difficult economic circumstances, we have declared the year 2000 our year of delivery in a number of key economic, social and political areas. in the coming weeks, the commission that is reviewing the national constitution will complete its work, and we look forward to receiving its report. those recommendations will be the result of an extensive and all-inclusive process of consultations and will reflect precisely the wishes of the entire swazi nation. we believe this national exercise will further enhance the unity of the swazi people and provide the best possible foundation for our continuing peace and stability. on the economic front, we continue to make every effort to achieve sustainable growth and to reduce the level of poverty among our people. in addition to encouraging both local and foreign investment, the government this year launched an ambitious programme of initiatives called the millennium project, targeting the tourism and manufacturing industry subsectors. this project is designed to maximize the potential of the kingdom in these areas and to reduce the current unacceptably high level of unemployment, which is threatening to undermine all our best efforts at development. among the many challenges we face as a developing nation, there is no question that the hiv/aids crisis presents the most serious threat to our hopes of improving the lives of our people. in the last years of the twentieth century, much of the progress we have achieved in 32 years of independence in social welfare is being reversed by the rapid spread of this most terrible disease. hiv/aids represents the single most important issue facing our nation today, and we desperately need the support of the international community in our efforts to contain the threat to our very existence as a nation. we look to the united nations to take a much stronger leadership role in this global crisis, and to help us to mobilize resources to reverse the catastrophic spread of the pandemic. during the millennium summit, the kingdom of swaziland joined other developing countries in expressing concern at the negative effects of globalization on our economies, especially in the context of the widening gap between the rich and the poor countries. we are, however, reassured by summit's agreement to take measures to ensure that global trends such as globalization should have at their heart the principle of equitable benefit for all nations, regardless of size, level of development or economic strength. thus, in recent years, we have waited with great expectation to benefit from initiatives, particularly in the area of preferential trade access, that have been broadcast by our international friends and partners as measures that are designed to help the developing world to overcome the negative effects of globalization. my delegation is optimistic, therefore, that the recently concluded millennium summit will indeed serve as an historic occasion of strengthening international peace and security, as well as the prosperity of our people, in order to establish a fair international order. beginning with this session, what remains for all of us now is to see to it that the wishes of the founding fathers of the united nations are fulfilled. those wishes, ambitious as they may be, are not unreachable and can be achieved. this session, therefore, has the task of setting the pace for the dialogue that lies ahead. both the millennium summit and this session of the general assembly will have a 34 direct impact on the success of the united nations in achieving the goals set by those great visionary leaders. since the last session of the general assembly, the organization has held several global conferences. however, the implementation of commitments in some cases is regrettably slow. one of the priorities for the united nations should be an effective, integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of all these conferences. the implementation should be further enhanced within the existing machinery of the united nations through improving its functions. peace-building is a prevention task of growing importance. with the disaster that befell the united nations mission in sierra leone (unamsil), the united nations is facing one of the most comprehensive tasks in its history, which perhaps has made the need to review peacekeeping operations more imperative. we remain concerned about the serious negative impact of the proliferation of conflicts in the world, particularly in africa, on development capacity and on progress towards economic, social and political transformation. the situation in those countries affected by conflicts is appalling and deserves the organization's urgent attention. in africa, the democratic republic of the congo, rwanda, burundi, sierra leone and angola, among others, have been the scene of terrible turmoil, mass murders, destruction of property and much suffering on the part of refugees over the years. the organization of african unity (oau), the economic community of west african states (ecowas) and the southern african development community (sadc) have done much to contain and resolve some of these conflicts; and the united nations has also rendered its support. while some progress has been made in resolving some of these conflicts, much still needs to be done, especially by the parties involved. the latter have a responsibility to observe agreements concluded and must work closely together with the united nations and the regional organizations involved so that peace processes can be brought to a successful conclusion. with regard to the middle east, we are encouraged by the continued efforts by president clinton and other leaders to bring both israel and palestine to the negotiating table. we are hopeful that a long-lasting solution, which has eluded the region for so long, will be found soon. there is now more than ever a pressing need to finally carry out the long overdue substantial reform of the security council. the council must fully recognize the new realities of the global landscape. it must have a more representative composition, and above all, it must be equipped to react to the crises and conflicts of today. reform must involve enlargement to include both more permanent and non-permanent members, as well as strengthening its decision-making powers. the kingdom of swaziland unreservedly supports both the non-aligned movement and the african group positions in as far as the review of the composition and working methods of the security council is concerned. we do trust that the ongoing debate in the working group set up for this purpose will continue and that it will yield the much-expected results. the stage which the negotiations have now reached is such that it requires the commitment of all member states if indeed the security council is to be equipped with all the tools it needs to be equitably representative. participation of the united nations membership at large in the decision-making process, transparency in its work and imposition of charter restraints on the veto, with the aim of its eventual abolition, are indispensable imperatives. the enhancement of the relevance of the united nations requires, first and foremost, strengthening the role and increasing the efficiency of the general assembly through focusing its deliberations on contemporary challenges and problems facing the world, engaging it in timely and effective decision- making to address global economic and political issues and enabling it to seriously examine and effectively react to the work of the other organs of the united nations, particularly the security council. in this context, we believe that the general assembly, as the sole democratic universal and transparent organ, is the proper forum to carry out an in-depth analysis of the implications of the emerging debates on collective action. the kingdom of swaziland joins others in welcoming the republic of tuvalu as a new member of the organization. the addition of tuvalu brings closer to fruition the hope of the founding fathers to see a united nations comprised of all the countries of the world. the united nations is the only body that deals with all fields of human activity. it has been a catalyst of many initiatives that have improved the lives of peoples across the world. 35 in the same spirit of universality in which we welcome tuvalu, the kingdom of swaziland wishes to reiterate its appeal to the united nations regarding the question of the republic of china on taiwan. the kingdom of swaziland has in the past been in the forefront arguing in favour of the readmission of the republic of china on taiwan, and our position remains unchanged. the case for including the republic of china on taiwan in the activities of the united nations and its associated agencies takes on even greater relevance in the light of the peaceful transition of government following the successful expression of the wishes of the people of taiwan in the elections earlier this year. those 23 million people rightly consider it unacceptable that they are not represented in the one organization that should be truly global, and that they deserve a review of the special circumstances surrounding their bid. the republic of china on taiwan has shown time and again its willingness to participate in efforts to bring about true global peace, development and stability, and we believe that the rest of the world is poorer for being denied their involvement. the kingdom of swaziland believes that this new millennium provides the perfect opportunity to raise this issue and to restore the right of the people of the republic of china on taiwan to participate fully in the activities of our organization. there is no alternative to the united nations. its objectives and values are universal. we must spare no effort in seeing to it that the united nations continues to meet the current and evolving needs of its entire membership. it must become the core instrument of effective and fair global governance, if it is to be completely transformed to be what its founding fathers had envisaged.",Eswatini,Africa,81.6606979370117,5.508480072021484,1741.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,2.2975301550832854
CAF,55,2000,"our stubborn quest for a world of peace, progress, solidarity and of concord recently prompted the heads of state and of government from the world over to commit themselves at the millennium summit to joint reflection about the ways of making a reality of this aspiration in the twenty-first century. the conclusions they arrived at, conclusions that can be summarized as the need for us to usher in a new era in international relations, without a doubt mark the framework for the future work of our organization. it is thus a positive circumstance that our work is unfolding against this backdrop so that during our deliberations we might strive to act in accordance with the guidelines set for us by our heads of state. but before my delegation attempts its own assessment of the state of the world as we look at the fresh challenges facing us in the twenty-first century, i should like, on behalf of his excellency mr. ange- felix patasse, president of our republic and head of state, who wishes us every success in our work, to address to you, mr. president, as well as to the other members of the bureau, our heartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency of this session. your superb mastery of international affairs in the context of which your country, finland, holds a very special place, bodes well indeed for the success of this session and, in this connection, you can count on the cooperation of the delegation of the central african republic. the competence with which your predecessor, mr. theo-ben gurirab of namibia, guided the work at the fifty-fourth session, has earned the full appreciation of my delegation. i should like as well to express again to the secretary-general the full support of the government of the central african republic for all he is constantly doing at the helm of our organization to provide solid underpinnings for peace and development in a world which has become complex indeed. the relevance of the proposals that he put forward in his introductory report at the millennium summit reflect his deep commitment to fully serving the cause of the organization, and we are deeply grateful. furthermore, the central african republic, which has always encouraged our organization to stride forward towards universality, welcomes the admission 7 of tuvalu as the 189th member state. i am delighted to congratulate this young republic on behalf of the delegation of the central african republic. a world of peace, of progress, of solidarity and of concord, such was the philosophy of the founding fathers of the united nations. how can one explain then that 55 years later we should be so far from attaining that goal? peace, when it is not assured, gives way to war. factors such as penury, destitution, poverty, aids, malaria and tuberculosis compounded by intolerance, injustice, indifference and social inequalities these make up the threats to the balance of peace. progress is a reality for only a quarter of humankind, while three quarters still are not enjoying decent living conditions. solidarity still is something selectively applied in a world that is nonetheless interdependent. all this cannot foster fellowship within this constantly changing world. that is the state of the world as we enter the twenty-first century. the secretary-general's report entitled we the peoples: the role of the united nations in the twenty- first century has the merit of having pointed out all these distortions that do not help to ensure the smooth unfolding of international relations. but even though the united nations, 55 years after having come into being, has not fulfilled the hopes to which its inception gave rise, the fact nonetheless remains that it does exist. and the fact that it still does exist is something which first and foremost is due to the determination of states, which do in fact feel the need for this organization. we must therefore stimulate renewed interest in the united nations; that is what is at stake at this session. the united nations must regain its authority in order to contribute to regulating the course of events in the world in the twenty-first century. on the basis of real solidarity among states, we must conceive of a new kind of cooperation that would make it possible for us collectively to organize a defence of peace, the promotion of development and of progress, as well as the fostering of human rights and of democracy everywhere around the world. the fact is that as you look around the world these days, you find that peace is jeopardized in many different countries, and especially on the african continent. what is more, all this is happening as though the conventional conflict-settlement machinery were no longer suited to coping with crisis situations. still, the resources afforded by the united nations, as well as by regional organizations, have made it possible for a new attitude in the face of conflict to emerge, one which first and foremost involves regional solidarity. it is in this context that my country today still plays host to a united nations office, the united nations peace-building support office in the central african republic (bonuca), responsible for striving to consolidate peace. indeed the tragic events for which the central african republic became the staging ground in 1996 and 1997 prompted african countries first to intervene in the context of the inter-african mission to monitor the implementation of the bangui agreements (misab), before bringing the united nations into the picture. the united nations mission in the central african republic (minurca) made a genuine contribution by its very presence and by what it did in restoring peace and in promoting national reconciliation, thanks to the support provided in organizing both legislative and presidential elections. i would like here again to express the appreciation of the government of the central african republic to the secretary-general of the united nations, to the members of the security council and especially to the countries that so generously contributed to supporting that mission of peace by providing the wherewithal for minurca. the experience gained in the central african republic can be made available as an asset to the united nations, reflecting a success in keeping the peace and consolidating it. my delegation, which supports the brahimi report, hopes that the recommendations it embodies will be fully implemented so that we really see take root a new doctrine for united nations operations of peacekeeping. in the same vein, my delegation hopes that the united nations provides the same resources to 8 promoting a lasting settlement in the situations in sierra leone, in angola, in burundi, between ethiopia and eritrea, as well as in the democratic republic of the congo. as to the democratic republic of the congo, which shares a rather long border with my own country, my delegation calls for cooperation from the international community in the context of the united nations, so that a solution may be found to this conflict, the consequences of which have already taken a heavy toll, both for the congolese people, with which we are bound by fraternal ties, as well as for the neighbouring states such as the central african republic, which is currently hosting tens of thousands of refugees that have fled the effects of the war. my delegation takes advantage of this opportunity to call upon the competent international authorities, the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees in particular, to devote special attention to the central african republic in this instance. moreover, my delegation firmly supports the ongoing process seeking to bring about a settlement to the question of the middle east. we do not doubt that the determination of the parties involved will make it possible to lift the last remaining obstacles so that a fair, negotiated and lasting solution in accordance with security council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) may be found. the united nations subsequently should regain its authority in order to enable it to contribute by letting multilateralism work to promote development throughout the world. the fact is that without denying what has been done internationally to fight poverty and while acknowledging that developing countries should shoulder primary responsibility for ensuring the necessary preconditions for their development, my delegation hopes that the community of states will come to grips with the question of poverty and will apply a fresh way of thinking to it in this twenty-first century. all the indicators of poverty are there for us to see, and you can find them everywhere in africa: weak primary educational systems, a lack of sanitary infrastructure, a lack of drinking water, of the proper conditions for hygiene, to name but a few. the african continent is part of that 1 billion inhabitants of our planet living on less than one dollar a day, while two- thirds of the population of the planet hold three- quarters of the world's income. poverty is extreme in africa; we must do our utmost to come up with new ways to reduce it in the twenty-first century. the central african republic, which at the beginning of this year took part in the libreville summit on growth and poverty reduction in africa, abides by the new strategic framework to combat poverty proposed by the bretton woods institutions. my country therefore calls for an increase in the resources allocated to such agencies as the united nations development programme, the united nations population fund, the united nations children's fund (unicef) and the united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization to support the central african republic's strategy to combat poverty. of course, eradicating poverty will be necessary in order to make it possible for developing countries to take part in the work of development. that is particularly true with regard to the countries of africa. but it will also be necessary to put developing countries in a position where they can really rise to the development challenge. in this connection, the issue of the debt burden comes to mind, for it continues to substantially handicap all development efforts. how, then, can we ensure that globalization stimulates development in africa instead of leading to marginalization? inasmuch as the new technologies that are being introduced contribute to the overall progress of mankind, africa must expect to benefit, and we once again call for the rules governing the work of the world trade organization to take africa's interests into account. in his introductory report to the millennium summit, the secretary-general reminded us that all activity is people-oriented. nothing is more true. my delegation hopes that the united nations will regain its authority so that it can contribute to ensuring the necessary conditions for the promotion of rights and democracy throughout the world. guaranteeing and protecting human rights contributes to national consensus and strengthening democracy in a country. we have understood that so well in the central african republic that we have created a government body called the high commission for human rights, whose mission is not only to monitor respect for human 9 rights, but also to implement the various international legal instruments signed by the central african republic aimed at promoting human rights. that implementation requires resources in order to bring about the most widespread dissemination possible of human rights at the national level. as human rights are indivisible, it is important to establish cooperation between states to promote human rights throughout the world. my delegation hopes that in the course of the twenty-first century the united nations will become increasingly involved in international efforts to establish a worldwide culture of human rights. it must be reformed and renewed in order to be able to take on that role. renewal means adaptation to the realities of the world today. the organization's procedures, methods and approaches to every issue within its competence will have to be streamlined. however, let us not forget that protecting international peace and security is the primary task entrusted to the united nations. that role is primarily the responsibility of the security council. my delegation would like to see the security council reformed in order to better discharge that responsibility. the world has changed profoundly, and the composition of the security council should reflect that. even though the veto power is not as abused today as it was during the cold war, we should restructure the council in both the permanent and non-permanent categories to take into account the new international reality. that is the opinion of the delegation of the central african republic. in that way we can contribute to setting relations between nations on a different course. that requires a real and willing commitment by states. this year's adoption of the constitutive act of the african union as an expression of africa's willingness to join the united nations in meeting all the challenges is a manifestation of that commitment. my country will do everything in its power to encourage this new movement towards integration. the century that witnessed the birth of the united nations has ended. a new century is beginning, one in which there is still a united nations something that is cause for satisfaction to mankind. but what shall we make of the united nations in the twenty-first century? that is indeed the fundamental question raised by the secretary-general in his report to the millennium summit. should we continue to keep the united nations locked in the vice of contradictions that exists between member states? should we continue to look on helplessly as its authority is flouted in peacekeeping operations? should we continue to accept the organization's being left behind as the world moves forward? the answer, in the opinion of the delegation of the central african republic, is a resounding no. let us therefore return to the dream of the founding fathers and make sure that in the new century the united nations has the necessary means to bring about peace, solidarity and harmony throughout the world. such a world is possible if we want it. that is the world our heads of state spoke of in their message to us at the millennium summit.",Central African Republic,Africa,50.6451683044434,1.612650036811829,2345.0,12.0,0.0,12.0,5.11727078891258
MUS,55,2000,"it gives me great pleasure to address the assembly under the leadership of mr. harri holkeri. i offer him our heartiest congratulations on his election to preside over this first session of the new millennium and assure him of the total support and cooperation of my delegation. we would like also to thank mr. theo-ben gurirab, the foreign minister of namibia, for the excellent manner in which he presided over the work of the fifty-fourth session of the general assembly. this year again, we wish to compliment the secretary- general, mr. kofi annan, for his remarkable leadership in the conduct of the work of the united nations. we pay special tribute also to the president of the fifty- fourth session of the general assembly and to the secretary-general for their imaginative and tireless efforts in achieving the resounding success of the millennium summit, held here just a few weeks ago. we also wish to welcome tuvalu as the newest member of the united nations family. during that historic summit the largest gathering of heads of state or government the world has ever seen the relevance and importance of the united nations in a global society was emphasized. world leaders pledged most prominently their commitment to ensuring that the united nations adapts to the new era and strengthens its capacity to deal with the challenges of maintaining peace and security, eliminating poverty and promoting development and progress for the benefit of all humanity. 13 since its inception, the united nations has been a beacon of hope to mankind for a more secure and prosperous world. the recently adopted millennium declaration provides fresh impetus to the united nations to rededicate itself to the fulfilment of the lofty ideals of our organization, namely to uphold world peace and security and promote cooperation and development in all areas of human endeavour. the maintenance of world peace and security remains the biggest challenge for our organization. the continued existence of nuclear arsenals and the threat of a nuclear disaster represent a major impediment to the maintenance of peace and security. following the end of the cold war, the feeling of insecurity created by nuclear militarization has diminished, but the international community's aspiration to global disarmament and the complete elimination of weapons of mass destruction within a defined time-frame has eluded us. we welcome all the efforts the international community is making towards achieving universal acceptance of the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons (npt). yet more than 30,000 nuclear weapons are deployed around the world, including weapons that are still maintained in a high state of readiness. the risk that nuclear weapons may explode, whether by design or by accident, is ever growing. my delegation is convinced that the early convening of an international conference on nuclear disarmament to address issues of global denuclearization, including the total elimination of all existing nuclear weapons within a specific time-frame, is of critical importance. such a conference would allow all states, most importantly those possessing nuclear capabilities and which do not fall under the purview of the npt and the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty (ctbt), to voice their concerns and contribute substantially towards achieving a world free of nuclear weapons. this is a debt we owe to generations yet unborn. the role of the security council in the crucial area of international peace and security is evident. however, this central organ of our organization will be rendered even more effective if it is further strengthened to make it respond positively to the emerging new realities which the new millennium is bound to confront. members of the united nations attach great importance to the need for reform of this supreme body. it is to be noted that under the existing provisions of the charter, which date back from a time when two thirds of the members of the united nations were still under colonial rule, a handful of states on the security council have the power to make decisions that bind the whole membership. such a mode of operation is completely out of tune with today's realities, and, for this institution to retain its credibility, it should undergo a comprehensive reform, taking into consideration proper and equitable geographical representation. in this regard, mauritius supports the position of the non-aligned movement and the organization of african unity (oau) on the expansion and representativity of the security council, and we look forward to an early conclusion of the work of the open-ended working group on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the security council. we support an increase in the membership of the security council, and we are in favour of making the council an effective representative body that can act in the interests of humankind at large at all times. the meeting of the security council at the level of heads of state during the millennium summit was an unparalleled opportunity for the 15 members to discuss, at the highest level, how to make peacekeeping operations more responsive. we are all aware that deployment of united nations troops in conflict situations is seen as the last chance for the restoration of peace and, in this venture, we simply cannot afford to fail. therefore, the discussions that took place at the summit level of the security council need to be seriously pursued so that the future orientation of peacekeeping operations may be effected on a sounder basis. in this respect, we welcome the proposals for improving the united nation peacekeeping performance, as contained in the report of the panel on united nations peace operations the brahimi report and we look forward to their speedy implementation. it is indeed a sad reflection that at the dawn of a new century, several african nations, such as angola, the democratic republic of the congo, sierra leone, burundi, somalia and the comoros remain trapped in civil conflicts with disastrous consequences for millions of people on the continent and in the 14 subregion. at the regional level, the oau, as well as leaders of the subregions concerned, have spared no efforts to address each of these conflicts, but we need to realize that no great success has been achieved so far. the intransigence of the main protagonists involved continues to remain the stumbling block towards the peaceful resolution of conflicts in africa. the involvement of the united nations in these conflicts has unfortunately also met with little success. we need to be imaginative, and we need to explore, with the civil society in each country in conflict, ways and means to convincingly establish that the fruits of peace are achievable. we need to look at the permanence of our interests, and these are based in peace and stability. we also note with great concern that, despite all the efforts and steps taken by the oau for a speedy return to constitutional order in the comoros, the anjouanese separatists and the military leadership in moroni have signed the fomboni declaration in defiance of the oau and the international community. we urge the international community to refrain from lending any support to the fomboni joint declaration which, we believe, will undermine the unity and territorial integrity of the comoros. indeed, it is unacceptable that the future of the archipelago of the comoros be compromised by two individuals who are non-elected and do not represent the aspirations of the population. we reiterate our support to the oau in its ongoing efforts aimed at resolving the crisis, in accordance with the provisions of the antananarivo accord, which remains the most viable framework for a lasting, consensual and durable solution to the crisis. we call on the military regime and the separatists in anjouan to cooperate with the oau so as to achieve an early resolution of the crisis. we welcome the signing of the agreement on cessation of hostilities between ethiopia and eritrea this year. this is a positive step, and we urge the oau, the united nations and other states to continue support for these two countries to take the next steps to conclude a settlement for lasting peace. our region deserves no less. while, inevitably, the international community, through the united nations and regional and subregional organizations, must continue to do all it can to end the existing conflicts and prevent new ones, there is an important aspect of civil conflict that cannot be overlooked any longer. it has been established beyond doubt that civil conflicts such as those in angola and sierra leone have resulted from personal ambition or greed for private enrichment on the part of powerful individuals, rather than in pursuit of a legitimate cause and struggle for the common good. in pursuit of their sinister designs, these individuals wage long wars on and against their own people and, acting with impunity, inflict untold suffering on the masses, including women, the elderly and children, cause refugee problems within and outside their national frontiers, and retard development and progress of their countries we believe that such dangerous persons should not only be condemned and stopped as early as possible from pursuing their unpatriotic designs, but also should be made to answer to their people and to the international community for the crimes they commit. the proposed international criminal court should serve as the tribunal of the international community to try and punish such individuals and, the sooner it starts functioning, the better it will be for humanity at large. the international criminal court will not only be a deterrent for people who engage in heinous crimes but will also be an important instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security. unless such a step is taken, the world will continue to face similar tragedies, and the perpetrators of such tragedies will go unpunished. at long last, we have seen a glimmer of hope for the suffering people of somalia. we congratulate the leaders of the intergovernmental authority for development (igad) for their initiative in putting together a peace and reconciliation process that will allow for the establishment of a representative government to take charge of the affairs of the country. we appeal to all factions in somalia to come together and to take part in this new initiative, with a view to stopping the misery that the somali people have endured for too long. important steps have been made this year towards peace in the middle east. we congratulate president arafat and prime minister barak for the courage they demonstrated recently during the difficult negotiations in camp david under the guidance of president clinton. we believe that, having reached such a crucial stage of the negotiations, president arafat and prime minister barak must meet the daunting challenge of taking further steps forward to reach a final agreement. 15 we are confident that both leaders have the capacity to bridge the gaps and reach a mutually acceptable and satisfactory agreement. we appreciate that the issues outstanding in the path of such an agreement are delicate, but we are confident that the leaders of the region will respond to the ardent wish of peoples around the world for a peaceful middle east. it may sound like an anachronism, but it has happened just a few months ago in the pacific region namely in fiji and in the solomon islands that small bands of thugs have overturned democratically elected governments. in the case of fiji, prime minister mahendra chaudhry together with his whole cabinet of ministers, was held hostage for as long as 56 days, in a struggle for political power. the prime minister was set free only after he finally conceded that his government would resign. the international community watched helplessly as the tragic situation unfolded in fiji. the fact that this is not the first time that a democratically elected government is overthrown by unorthodox and violent means makes the situation all the more serious and calls for the immediate attention of the international community. mauritius condemns unreservedly all attempts by any group, anywhere, to thwart the will of the people by force. i am reminded here of the statement of the united nations secretary-general at the opening of the oau summit in lome this year when, applauding the oau decision to exclude governments that have come to power by unconstitutional means from participating in oau meetings, he expressed the wish that some day the united nations also would take a similar decision. the time has come for us to seriously consider such avenues in order to send a clear signal to people who are bent upon perpetrating constitutional violations in total disregard of the will of the people. mauritius remains fully committed to the respect and promotion of human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. these principles are enshrined in our constitution. with regard to human rights, our commitment goes far beyond our national borders, as reflected in our membership in various united nations committees, where we play an active role. multi-party, free and fair elections constitute core traditions jealously cherished by the people of mauritius. in the exercise of our valued democratic rights, on 11 september last, just 10 days ago. the people of mauritius, for the seventh time since our independence in 1968, elected a new government. this government remains committed to supporting strongly, at the national, regional and international levels, the principles i have mentioned earlier. since we met in september last, we have witnessed several acts of terrorism in various parts of the world endangering the lives of numerous innocent people. the hijacking of an indian airlines jet, the kidnapping of unsuspecting tourists from a malaysian holiday resort and bomb attacks in some capitals are grim reminders of the dangers we face at the hands of unscrupulous and heartless fanatics. we condemn all acts of terrorism and call on the international community to take concerted action to deal with this problem. for our part, mauritius stands prepared to play a significant role in the united nations and its various organs to combat all such acts which pose a threat to international peace and security. i had some remarks on people-centred development, debt and globalization. i refer delegates to the text that will be circulated. i will now talk about regional cooperation. mauritius attaches great priority to global partnership in addressing the key issues of poverty alleviation, achieving sustainable growth and development, and peace and security. we believe that regional cooperation continues to be the inevitable route towards strengthening international partnership and cooperation. regional cooperation not only is desirable, but constitutes a necessary dimension in the process of the regional integration of many economies into the global economy. small island developing states, which constitute one fifth of the membership of the united nations, are in a particularly difficult situation due to their vulnerability to a wide range of ecological, climatic and economic factors. the specificities of these states have been articulated in the barbados programme of action for the sustainable development of small island developing states. constraints to their sustainable development include a narrow resource base that does not allow them to benefit from economies of scale, and the fact that they have small domestic markets. they also rely heavily on external markets, which are usually geographically distant, and costs for transportation, energy and infrastructure are high. in addition, small island states have little resilience to natural disasters. a vulnerability index of 16 socio-economic and other parameters has been prescribed for these states in the barbados programme of action. we urge the united nations and other international organizations to coordinate their efforts in developing and refining such an index, which should be used, together with other factors, by the world trade organization and the bretton woods institutions to accord special and preferential treatment to this category of state. i wish to say a few words now about the chagos archipelago and the island of tromelin. respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity is, under the united nations system, an acquired and inalienable right of every state, however big or small. we are conscious that the united nations favours the completion of the process of decolonization. for a number of years now, we have continuously brought before the general assembly the question of the chagos archipelago, which has always formed part of the state of mauritius. this assembly will recall that the chagos archipelago, including the island of diego garcia, was detached by the colonial power just before our independence, in violation of general assembly resolutions 1514 (xv) of december 1960 the declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples and 2066 (xx) of 16 december 1965, which prohibits the dismemberment of colonial territories prior to the accession to independence. we have all along sought to resolve this issue bilaterally with the united kingdom through dialogue, but there has been no tangible progress so far. this issue has now reached a critical stage and we are extremely anxious to have meaningful negotiations with the united kingdom with a view to resolving this matter within the shortest possible time. we also reiterate our demand that, pending a resolution of this issue, the former residents of the chagos archipelago and their families, who were forcibly evicted and sent to mauritius by the colonial power, be allowed to return to their homeland. we launch a fresh appeal to the former colonial power, the united kingdom, to come forward and engage in serious and purposeful discussions with us towards the early settlement of the chagos archipelago question. we wish to stress that mauritius will never abandon its intention to reunite its territory and to assert its sovereignty over the chagos archipelago. we also urge france, with which we have been discussing the issue of the return to us of the island of tromelin, another outer island territory of mauritius, to work with us constructively for an early resolution of this important issue. there is an agreement in principle for the co-determination of the island and its surrounding maritime space and we need to work out further modalities so as to arrive at a final solution on this issue. (spoke in french) i was gratified by the meeting, on 6 september 2000, of heads of state and government of french- speaking states members of the united nations. that meeting allowed us to consider and arrive at the truth that the united nations is the keystone that will allow mankind to free itself from the chains and other prejudices that hinder the evolution of international affairs and globalization, the two main engines of a better future for all. this meeting offered french- speaking states members of the united nations the opportunity firmly to assert their determination to achieve that objective. i wish to stress that the future to which we aspire and in which we place our hopes must develop in conditions of respect for and promotion of the plurality of our peoples, their cultural and ethnic diversity and their multilingualism. we are duty-bound to respect, maintain and preserve the nature of our world, that rainbow of many cultures which, through globalization and the united nations, will be a source of enormous wealth for states and individuals. the republic of mauritius daily lives out this vision of the future. our experience prompts us to subscribe to that vision for the common good. hopes and dreams are built on concrete action. with the assistance of all its member states, the united nations must enjoy better and greater means. only thus will peace become a tangible reality. without peace and security, any effort at development is doomed to failure and the happiness to which the peoples of the world aspire will remain dead letter. (spoke in english) it goes without saying that, to achieve the objectives of a more peaceful, just and prosperous world, nations need to rededicate themselves to new commitments in the twenty-first century. our delegation is ready to assume this responsibility and 17 looks forward to a fruitful outcome for the session that lies ahead under mr. holkeri's leadership. i wish to end on a note of optimism with regard to the capacity of the united nations to address global issues and to spearhead development and progress. my delegation is confident that our organization and its specialized agencies are poised to play an even greater role in global reconstruction. we live in a highly demanding world. it wants results, seeks accountability and is not ready to condone failures. we all have a responsibility to make the world a safer place and to ensure a better future for our people. we can do it. let us do it. before i conclude, however, i wish to take this opportunity to confirm the candidature of mauritius for election to one of the non-permanent seats in the security council in the elections that are scheduled to take place next month. as far back as january 2000, mauritius announced to all countries of the east african region that we would seek election to a non- permanent seat on the security council. at that time, mauritius was the only declared candidate. the government of mauritius considers itself fully qualified to serve on the security council, which is the supreme organ of the united nations, in the larger interests of peace and security and to contribute in a substantial measure to the important work of our organization. as a multi-party democracy in a multi-ethnic society, mauritius has a track record in international relations and we consider that the standing of the security council depends upon that of its constituent members. the security council will be called upon to take important decisions in the interests of peace and security and it is important that the security council act as a homogeneous body. it is the wish of my country that our candidature be considered on its merits. we will very much appreciate the general assembly's support in this regard.",Mauritius,Africa,84.303092956543,3.719039916992188,3644.0,9.0,0.0,9.0,2.469813391877058
BDI,55,2000,"on behalf of the burundi delegation and on my own behalf, i first congratulate you warmly, sir, on your election to lead the work of the current session. your election is an honour and a sign of the great esteem in which the united nations family holds you and your country, finland, which maintains friendly, cooperative relations with burundi. i would further like to pay a well deserved tribute to your predecessor, mr. theo-ben gurirab, minister for foreign affairs of the republic of namibia, who masterfully led the work of the previous session. we particularly appreciated his competence, dedication and high level of commitment to successfully fulfilling his mandate. i also salute the dynamic and innovative work of mr. kofi annan, the secretary-general, to achieve peace, security and development throughout the world. my delegation greatly appreciates his report, we the peoples: the role of the united nations in the twentyfirst century, which undertakes a painstaking and uncompromising analysis of the great challenges of these times and proposes an approach to overcoming them so that it will be possible to live in a world free from want and fear, in a world that meets our aspirations. finally, it is my pleasure to welcome warmly tuvalu as a new member of our organization, and at the same time to congratulate it on its wise decision to our ranks at this beginning of the new millennium. my delegation unreservedly supports and endorses the millennium declaration, adopted by our heads of state and government on 8 september 2000. we very much hope that its pertinent recommendations, made by almost all the world's leaders, will not become a dead letter. the united nations, and each country in particular, must implement the appropriate strategies to translate the recommendations into concrete actions that can improve the future of our populations and peoples in particular the most disadvantaged. at one of the meetings of the millennium summit, which concluded on 8 september 2000, the minister for foreign affairs and cooperation of burundi, speaking on behalf of the head of state, stated: the burundian people are in the process of turning a page in their history. the agreement on peace and national reconciliation was signed on 28 august in arusha, tanzania, before the eyes of the entire world, which hailed the occasion. this was a qualitative leap 12 forward towards a better future for the burundian people. (a/55/pv.7) later the minister said, however: everything has not yet been resolved ... the greatest remaining challenge is ending the war, without which the implementation of the agreement is practically impossible. (ibid.) the end to the war was to have been negotiated yesterday, 20 september, at a meeting scheduled in nairobi between the government and the rebels, and before the heads of state of the region. the president of the republic himself represented the government. the heads of state of the region and, of course, the mediator were also there. the three political parties that had not signed the 28 august peace agreement were also there, and they signed the agreement. thus the maximum number of parties have now accepted this agreement. as for the rebels, only one movement, the fnl, was represented by its leader. the head of the other movement the cndd-fdd, which is the more important group did not make the trip. the two movements refused to negotiate anything or to meet with the government delegation. rather, they contented themselves with repeating their preconditions and pleading that they had to consult their rank and file before making any commitments. thus the meeting was a failure. the hopes of the burundi people of seeing the violence come to an end were dashed. the implementation of the peace agreement has been called into question. the signatories to the agreement on peace and national reconciliation negotiated two years ago are now accused of being traitors and men of straw, and are being asked to return to the negotiating table. those taking part in the rebel uprising go so far as to call into question the good faith of the leaders who sponsored the negotiations and the signing of the peace agreement. before denouncing the 28 august peace agreement, the rebel uprising had hidden itself behind a series of preconditions for the ceasefire negotiations. the two principal preconditions were as follows. the first precondition was the dismantling of the regroupment camps. this precondition has been meaningless since 31 july 2000, because the government had committed itself to dismantling the camps by that date, and it kept this promise, as the united nations has confirmed on the basis of reports from its agencies working in the field in burundi. the facilitator, mr. nelson mandela, himself publicly reaffirmed these reports during the signing of the peace agreement on 28 august. the second precondition related to the release of political prisoners an issue that has been the source of a great deal of disagreement between the negotiating parties. but since then, thanks to the compromise that the parties have reached, contained in article 15 and point 20 of the second protocol to the peace agreement, the current government can create an independent commission to look into, inter alia, the issues of prison conditions and political prisoners. that is why it has just asked the secretary-general to send to burundi a team of experts in criminal law to inquire freely into the existence or nonexistence of political prisoners in burundi. it is no longer possible to deal with this question outside of the peace agreement unless one wants to imperil the entire peace process. the government and the people of burundi were very grateful for the opportunity they had to explain to the facilitator during his two visits to burundi how delicate the problem was. burundians suffer enormously from war; they want finally to breathe the air of peace. deadly, wanton ambushes against people travelling on the roads, attacks on innocent people in the hills and in the displaced persons camps, theft of livestock, destruction of houses, crops, social infrastructure and so on all of this must stop so that, finally, our country can regain its peace and tranquillity. setting conditions to halt violence is cruel, and the international community must condemn this attitude and those responsible for it. given the intransigence of the rebels, the government of burundi calls upon the region and the international community to implement the provisions of article 2 of the peace agreement, which states that if the armed groups of the non-signatory parties reject the invitation made in the agreement to suspend hostilities and to start negotiations for a ceasefire, the guarantors of the agreement, particularly the governments of neighbouring states, and the international organizations will take the necessary steps to stop, 13 demobilize, disarm and, where appropriate, arrest, detain and repatriate the members of these armed groups and, furthermore, take all appropriate steps against any party which encourages and supports such activities. in the absence of a ceasefire not only do the innocent continue to die, but also the refugees and displaced persons cannot return home; assistance to rebuild the country cannot begin; and even the transitional institutions established cannot function properly. why is the international community silent when two armed movements are holding hostage an entire people that had pinned so many hopes on the peace agreement which has now been signed by 19 out of 19 parties in other words, all of the negotiators? the government, as it has often repeated, is prepared to negotiate directly with the rebels and to conclude the ceasefire agreement as soon as possible. it will also continue to explain the peace agreement to the people so that they will support its contents and its programme. it is also continuing consultations in order to arrive at compromise solutions regarding the reservations expressed by certain parties about the agreement and other questions that are still pending. we would be deluding ourselves if we said that burundi will attain peace and security without a favourable environment in the subregion and in africa in general. unfortunately, nothing leads one yet to hope that peace will be established in the great lakes region any time soon. the lusaka agreements signed in august 1999 still offer a few glimmers of hope before actually entering into force. however, they are an important basis for the resolution of the conflict in the democratic republic of the congo. the summit that took place, again in lusaka, on 14 and 15 august 2000 unfortunately ended in failure, even though it was one more chance to establish the basis for peace. however, a lost opportunity should not discourage us. we would like here to say that we very much support president frederick chiluba of the republic of zambia for his tireless efforts to find a solution to the question of the congo, and we encourage him to persevere. contrary to the allegations made by the head of the delegation of the democratic republic of the congo from this rostrum on 16 september, i wish to reaffirm that the only interest of my country, burundi, is to maintain security over our borders. we have no other ambitions, political or economic, with regard to any neighbouring country. and we hope that the same applies to our neighbouring countries, in particular those who give refuge to and assist the burundian rebels. each country, and the subregion in general, must focus on problems of development. the ideology of genocide, which is undermining the entire great lakes region, and the many armed rebellions by those who champion that ideology, will be overcome only through the concerted and determined efforts of all states of the great lakes region, with the active support of the international community. in this context, the conference on peace, security and development for the great lakes countries, envisaged for several years now, can be successful only if each country of the region makes a meaningful effort to improve their domestic policies. by holding the millennium summit, the united nations chose a very opportune moment to discuss the great challenges that await us in the coming century: peace, security and disarmament, on the one hand, and development and the eradication of poverty, on the other. as is so well summarized by the secretarygeneral in his report, we must live free from fear and free from want. although these two goals are the very essence of our organization, it must be stated that, unfortunately, we are still wide of the mark. fratricidal wars continue to break out in various parts of the world and it takes too long to put the fires out. conflicts break out on the borders of neighbouring countries, and entire communities are forced into exile. given the multitude of these conflicts and their complexity, the international community has only a mixed record of success. like other heads of delegations that have preceded me, i am inclined to wonder why our organization does not do better in preventing and resolving conflicts and in peacekeeping. on this subject, we very much support the implementation of the valuable recommendations in the brahimi report, which was the outcome of an in-depth study at the request of mr. kofi annan on the activities of the united nations in the area of peace. we welcome the steps already taken by the secretary-general to prepare a detailed plan for the implementation of these recommendations. 14 if our organization were to engage in some selfquestioning, we would probably find that one of the primary causes for failure lies in the very functioning of the united nations. the security council decides on everything, and it decides too slowly. in the face of urgent situations, there is too much procrastination due to political expediency which is very often insufficiently understood by the international community. over the last fifty years, it is the same people who decide the fate of humanity while safeguarding the interests of some states as a matter of priority. people who seek urgent assistance thus have the impression that they are being held hostage or are being abandoned to their fate because international solidarity, so keenly awaited, does not materialize. my delegation, therefore, reiterates the hope that we will re-think the functioning, composition and attributes of the security council in order to revitalize it and to adapt it to this ongoing state of change. the question of the equitable representation of all regions of the world on the security council and the question of increasing the number of members, both permanent and non-permanent, deserve our attention. they are in tune with the imperatives of democracy and legitimacy in making decisions in this highly important organization the united nations. only such a reform can restore the confidence of all member states in reviving the force of law in international affairs, because today, weak nations are confronting, basically, the law of force. in order to do this the establishment of the international criminal court, the statute of which was adopted in rome in 1998, will, i am sure, be a useful tool to combat impunity. although sanctions fall exclusively within the competence of the security council, from 31 july 1996 until january 1999, burundi lived under a regime of economic sanctions imposed by neighbouring countries, which was in violation of the united nations charter because it was not an initiative of the security council. as has been pointed out, such sanctions have proved to be both unfair and counterproductive. because of the adverse effects of these sanctions in the economic and social area, those who suffer the most are innocent people the elderly, women and children. the security council should therefore resort to targeted sanctions only in serious and exceptional circumstances when other methods of pressure have failed, in order to avoid causing harm to the entire population. the other major obstacle to world peace is the proliferation of light weapons paradoxically, in poor countries. only with the combined efforts of all states will we be able to deal with this phenomenon, because arms manufacturers and merchants form a worldwide network that represents big financial interests. any peacekeeping programme should therefore include, as a matter of priority, the monitoring of flows of light arms, since it is such weapons that are used by most clandestine movements to cause death and destruction through terrorism. furthermore, fear cannot be dispelled from the world as long as competition to produce weapons of mass destruction continues. our organization should do everything it can to bring about complete global denuclearization in the medium term. this standing threat to humanity undermines all hopes for a world of peace, to which the founding fathers of our world organization aspired. those with the responsibility of governing some of the poorest countries in the world appreciate, on a daily basis, just how hard it is to ensure that peace can prevail in a community that is bereft of food and other basic needs. a proverb in our national language, kirundi, says, if you go to sleep with an empty stomach, you will wake up with a heart full of hatred. it is no secret that the world has an abundance of riches and resources of all kinds. but that does not prevent people in some parts of the world from dying of hunger or malnutrition, while their fellow human beings in other parts of the world and sometimes even in their own countries and cities are wallowing in luxury. this means that true cooperation is the kind that encourages growth in production and income to enable people to take control of health, education, nutrition and decent housing. by giving greater assistance to the poorest countries, the rich countries would be working not only for a fairer world but for greater security for their own people. the millennium report of the secretary-general, submitted under agenda item 49 (b) of the fifty-fourth session, rightly stresses the seriousness of the tragedy caused by the hiv/aids pandemic throughout the world, focusing particular attention on africa. of the 36 million people who are hiv-positive, more than 23 15 million are in sub-saharan african. according to that report, in the same region, more than one child in ten has lost its mother to aids. the very pessimistic prediction has been made that by 2010 there will be 40 million orphans. burundi has not escaped this dangerous epidemic, which appeared at the beginning of the 1980s and is continuing to cause devastation today, particularly among the most active and, therefore, the most productive people. in the meantime, with the assistance of the world health organization, the united nations children's fund and other actors, to which we extend our heartfelt thanks, my government has launched a robust prevention policy against hiv/aids. a special fund has been established to combat this scourge, which could decimate entire generations. that is why we endorse the recommendations of the secretary-general to reduce the hiv infection rate, particularly by increasing access to information, education and health services for people who are already infected. at the same time, we recommend that the pharmaceutical industry be provided with all the financial support necessary to develop an effective and affordable vaccine to eradicate this scourge by the end of the century. before we can be sure of having built a more secure and prosperous world, we must be mindful of the need to bequeath to our children an environmentally balanced planet. unfortunately, we have to say that the industrial progress that was supposed to have generated prosperity is making our natural environment increasingly unhealthy. we must, as a matter of urgency, control the quality of industrial production and the phenomenon of population growth, particularly in urban areas, if we wish to safeguard quality of life for future generations. we have often behaved as if nature would remain healthy without our making any effort. today, desertification is a threat to many countries that used to be covered with vegetation. drought has invaded regions that used to be crossed by great rivers and streams. in those places where there is still enough water, it takes millions of dollars to treat it to make it potable. my delegation would like to reiterate the secretary-general's appeal to all member states at the millennium summit to fund an assessment of ecosystems before it is too late. the result would no doubt be a clear, realistic programme to protect our environment. despite the difficult situation in which we have been living for several years, burundi, in close cooperation with other member states, will work steadfastly to achieve the goals pursued by our organization. we hope that the united nations will adapt to current challenges and to changing international relations for the benefit of all humankind.",Burundi,Africa,59.3036193847656,2.645479917526245,3112.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,1.6066838046272494
RWA,55,2000,"may i first, on behalf of our minister for foreign affairs, who could not be here, on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, join previous speakers in extending to the president our heartfelt congratulations on his election to preside over the fifty-fifth session. in addition, i congratulate his eminent predecessor, mr. theo-ben gurirab, and the secretary- general, mr. kofi annan, on the quality and great quantity of activities carried out during the recent summit. i also take this opportunity to congratulate and welcome tuvalu, the 189th member of our organization. we hope that other potential members, such as western sahara in africa, will soon be able to join us. the millennium summit in which the head of state of rwanda, mr. paul kagame participated evaluated the twentieth century and formulated recommendations for enhancing the work of the organization in the twenty-first century, now beginning. as a number of speakers emphasized, the twentieth century was the era both of great and unprecedented technological triumphs and of crises as great as the new means of destruction. the distressing feature of the first and second world wars was that they made use of the advanced technologies of the late nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century to cause enormous human and material devastation. in 1918 and again in 1945 all humanity was overwhelmed by the terrifying consequences of a world war. no more wars leading to the loss of millions of human lives; no more genocide: these were the calls of the founding countries of the united nations when they met in san francisco in october 1945. today, as in the past, the international community finds itself reliving horrors that it thought it had banished for ever, horrors that include the genocide in rwanda in 1994. it certainly was not a lack of theoretical principles of public morality or international law that contributed to preventing or stopping this genocide. these principles had even been greatly strengthened in 1948 by the universal declaration of human rights, and had been widely diffused throughout the world by many organizations that took up the banner of human rights. 2 the brahimi report (a/55/305) was needed. we welcome its conclusions and recommendations, and take this occasion to warmly congratulate our secretary-general, kofi annan, on having commissioned it and the two others that preceded it: the srebrenica report and the courageous carlsson report. our organization had its failures, but the brahimi report tells us that we can do better in the future. to miss this unique opportunity to reflect on what must be done, and how, would be to renounce our responsibilities and the principles and values expressed in the charter of our organization. another rwanda or srebrenica would disgrace us all. undoubtedly, we must look elsewhere for the true source of the problem. it is surprising that even today countries that claim to embrace human rights are delaying and using pretexts to block prosecution of the authors of the genocide. there are even some who afraid to accept or think about what happened refer to this genocide as what happened in rwanda in 1994, being afraid even to think about it. to take just one example, i refer to the observations of minister yerodia ndombasi on 16 september. in sum, my delegation calls on the international community to draw every possible lesson from the genocide committed in our country, so that never again such a human tragedy ceases to be an empty phrase. much more urgent is the question of assistance to rwanda for rebuilding and making good the huge material and moral damage caused by the 1994 genocide. such assistance was recommended in the reports of the independent inquiry set up by the united nations and of the organization of african unity's international panel of eminent persons. all the members of the international community represented here can help rwanda rebuild and develop. and each time we wish to do more for the organization and humanity let the brahimi report serve as a source of inspiration. i take this opportunity to salute the security council discussions of 15 april, when the recommendations of the carlsson report were considered and the council was urged to use its influence to ensure that they were effectively followed up by other united nations institutions and agencies, including the united nations development programme (undp), from which we are awaiting special assistance as part of the development assistance programme for rwanda. we venture to hope that the reforms under way at undp will lead to the provision of assistance based on a sincere and enthusiastic partnership according to the british model eloquently outlined by prime minister tony blair during the millennium summit. it is a partnership steeped in equality, justice and fraternal solidarity for all. we invite all our partners to embrace this initiative, in their relations not only with rwanda, but with all the other developing countries especially the former colonies. the reports that i have mentioned also justly call on the international community beyond contributing to the task of overcoming the devastating effects of genocide to contribute vigorously to preventing this crime against humanity, in particular by suppressing it. those who hide, protect and advocate for the criminals responsible for the 1994 genocide should think twice before persisting in this evil behaviour. i now come to the congolese crisis, certain aspects of which can be seen as an extension of the genocide committed in rwanda in 1994. it is worth recalling that after their defeat and withdrawal many militia members and former rwandan soldiers who were authors of the genocide took refuge in what is now the democratic republic of the congo. not only were these former soldiers and militia members not disarmed at the time, but they have benefited from new military equipment and training, allowing them to commit acts of genocide along the borders and prepare for a repetition of the previous widespread genocide campaign. is this not sufficient reason to ask a responsible government to act to preserve the sovereignty of its country and the security of its people? the assembly can well understand that this is hardly a case of a security pretext, but, rather, of a current reality. the plan for a massive invasion by the genocidal forces was thwarted in november 1996 thank god by the forces of the rwandan patriotic army. but from may 1997 to august 1998 it was necessary to once again repel infiltrations from the congo and to resist other acts of genocide committed in the north- western part of our country. the horrors of this rebellion have been the source of a number of resolutions, but the world seems to have rapidly forgotten them. it is in this context that our country now has a military presence in the congo a presence whose only purpose is to prevent a recurrence of genocide in 3 rwanda by the same interahamwe militia and soldiers of the previous regime. we have more or less succeeded in achieving our objectives. since 1998 we have captured many soldiers of the previous regime and interahamwe militia, contrary to what minister yerodia ndombasi told the assembly on 16 september. most of these soldiers there are many of them have rejoined the army. we are continuing to hold 135 of them while they await a decision. we have also succeeded in saving some of the interahamwe and the soldiers of the former regimes, as well as innocent civilians who had been held hostage during all this time for purely military and political purposes. in the category of liberated hostages, 12,000 were repatriated since august 1998, and the process continues. we have established centres to receive them on our borders with the democratic republic of the congo, and several humanitarian organizations, including the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr), have also been involved. this is a secret to no one, and it has been documented by the unhcr at goma and gisenyi. those who are against our successes say that these people are congolese citizens that we have forced into exile in rwanda, because their departure has created a vacuum in the operations of the allies of these forces of genocide. they are our citizens, and no one can claim to love them as much as we do. they are at home, awaiting the others with open arms. my government welcomed the signing of the lusaka agreements in july 1999 and still upholds them. their main principles are, first, that the inter- congolese political negotiations should lead to a new political order in the democratic republic of the congo; and, secondly, that the armed groups should be pursued and disarmed, including former rwanda military and the interahamwe authors of the 1994 genocide, who are still attempting to continue their misdeeds, encouraged by certain of our congolese brothers who go so far as to deny their presence on congolese territory with the sole purpose of vilifying us, to judge by the statement by minister yerodia ndombasi last saturday. the rwanda delegation deplores the kinshasa government's recently calling into question these same agreements, despite the fact that they are upheld by all the countries concerned of the subregion, the organization of african unity and the security council. just before that, the congolese government had created controversy by refusing to authorize the free movement of united nations military observers; and that free movement would not be possible outside those agreements, to which that country is a party. as far as rwanda is concerned, we believe that, at this time, the lusaka agreements constitute the only framework that will guarantee a lasting peace in the democratic republic of the congo and in the subregion. any other approach in this matter would run the risk of dangerously jeopardizing the peace process now under way. furthermore, the slowness and hesitations observed in our organization regarding the deployment of the forces of the united nations mission in the congo must be reviewed, and advantage must be taken of the current offers to strengthen the presence of the united nations in the zones evacuated by the signatory parties of the lusaka agreements. any attempt to reduce the force would only lead to the kind of catastrophe from which the brahimi report tries to spare us. i should like to take this opportunity to commend the growing role of regional and subregional organizations in resolving conflicts. as is well known, such a positive involvement has already led to considerable results in various parts of the world, including in south-east asia and western africa. it is our hope that the united nations will adopt a similar approach to regional contributions to its machinery for conflict resolution. if the question of conflicts in the world continues to be one of the major preoccupations of our organization, it would no doubt be a good idea to pay special attention to their prevention. this requires being attentive to the efforts made to eradicate, or at least attenuate, the root causes of conflicts, both domestic and external. with respect to rwanda, the halting of the 1994 genocide was followed by courageous policies inspired by the tragic lessons of our recent history. these policies were translated into the following actions for and factors of national reconciliation, as follows: in july 1994, a government of national unity and a parliament were established including all the components of the rwanda population and all the political circles of the country. this was an integrative approach such as had never before been known in 4 independent rwanda, despite the linguistic, socio- cultural and historical advantages that militate in its favour. the policy of exclusion, which lasted more than 30 years in all sectors of national life, from education to employment, was eliminated. we are pleased to have abolished, 60 years after its introduction, the identification card, which categorized people according to their ethnic origin and their place of origin and on the basis of which decisions were taken to kill people or to spare their lives. a skilled, professional national army was established, including the forces of the rwandan patriotic army, which liberated the country, as well as a portion of the forces of the former regime that had separated themselves from the perpetrators of genocide. we welcome their bravery and their discipline. the united nations needs troops of this type for difficult operations in sierra leone and elsewhere. in march 1999 the national commission on human rights and the commission for unity and national reconciliation were established. the judicial system was rehabilitated, which guarantees the independence of the magistrature. this judicial system has been strengthened by a form of justice called gachacha, which, while keeping to international judicial norms, will benefit from major inputs of the population at the early stages of a trial. this will have the advantage of accelerating the prosecution of those accused of genocide. in two and a half years more than 3 million refugees have been repatriated. this is all the more striking since rwanda's refugee problem, having lasted for more than 30 years, is the most numerous and longest-standing in africa. at present the only ones remaining outside the country are families of criminals responsible for genocide and some refugees whom rwanda wants to repatriate, but who are still being manipulated by those criminals. our head of state asked them to return in his inaugural statement at the supreme court, and some of them have begun to come back voluntarily to the country. democratic elections were held last year. following the upcoming local elections, they will be completed in october. these are orientations that today guide the policy of unity and national reconciliation, the need for which became clear after the genocide of 1994. beyond the eradication of genocide, there are many challenges that deserve the attention of the international community at the beginning of the new millennium. these relate to the gaps between developing countries and prosperous countries in the context of globalization, the reform of the united nations system and many other current problems, such as the spread of aids. with respect to the gap between developing countries and prosperous countries, the nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw gaps between industrialized countries and poor countries grow even wider. this resulted from technology as well as from political and commercial inequalities left over from the colonial era. after independence many development proposals were made, such as the provision of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for development assistance, technology transfers, a new international economic order favouring fair remuneration for commodities, and so on. all these strategies have been the subject of a number of international conferences. none of them has been implemented sustainably or consistently. some of them have remained theoretical and have not even begun to be implemented as programmes. but it is never too late. for some time now, we have been in an age of globalization of economies in the context of structural gaps that have not changed much since the sixties. my delegation would like to emphasize the urgent need for the preliminary adoption of certain measures to facilitate the establishment of machinery for efficient globalization. is there any need to recall that the external debt of developing countries constitutes, in and of itself, a real handicap to their economic recovery? how can one talk about growth in a context where external debt absorbs 60 per cent or more of the export income of these same developing countries? what will be the result of globalization in an environment where the competition of market economies reduces in advance the role of certain parts of the world to that of eternal consumers, with the monopoly on production elsewhere? these are all questions that deserve urgent answers and solidarity on the part of the international community. 5 my delegation believes more particularly that the success of globalization requires courageous accompanying measures, such as eliminating the debt for poor countries and providing support for economic integration policies, in particular in africa. this requires our world organization to endow itself with machinery that can help to guide globalization. for some time now, the united nations has rightly been concerning itself, at the highest level, with the reform of the functioning of its structures. this is an urgent matter, as it affects what is at stake for the future and even the survival of all of humankind, which can no longer be managed in the same spirit and with the same structures as 55 years ago. we should remember that the number of member states has increased from 51 in 1954 to 189 today; that is an irrefutable argument for democratization. in this same context, africa, which has 10 times as many member states in the united nations as it did when the organization was founded, must occupy the place it deserves in the major decision-making bodies of the united nations, such as the security council and others. the bretton woods institutions must also change their character and behaviour if globalization and equity are to be real and consistent. in conclusion, i would like to speak about that other challenge for our times: the aids pandemic. this disease is currently responsible for the loss of more human lives that the most deadly wars. the people of the poorest countries are the most vulnerable in the face of this disease of the century. the delegation of rwanda would like, from this rostrum, to make an urgent appeal to the international community to show solidarity in the face of the threat of extinction of the human race that aids represents. put simply, taking aids lightly trivializes the crime of genocide. both are exterminating people and should be combated with vigour and determination. more specifically, aid should be provided for humanitarian if for no other reasons, so that the least developed countries can benefit from the most up- to-date medicines, at affordable prices, that can provide relief from people suffering from aids and do all that they can to contain this scourge. furthermore, my delegation is convinced that an effort to mobilize the greatest possible financial resources would enable scientific research to take place to bring this disease, and others, such as malaria, which are devastating a large part of the population, under control. we hope that the twenty-first century, which is just beginning, will usher in a world of peace and solidarity that will meet the greatest aspirations of humanity.",Rwanda,Africa,64.8886032104492,3.434180021286011,3075.0,7.0,0.0,7.0,2.2764227642276422
SDN,55,2000,"it gives me great pleasure at the outset to convey to mr. harri holkeri on behalf of my delegation our congratulations on his election as president for this session. aware of his well-known diplomatic experience and skill, we are confident that he will lead the work of this session to success. i should also like to express our appreciation and admiration for the role played by his predecessor, mr. theo-ben gurirab, foreign minister of namibia, during his presidency of the previous session, and for his co-chairmanship of the millennium summit. in this respect, i commend the secretary-general, mr. kofi annan, for his remarkable efforts in preparing for the millennium summit and the millennium assembly. on behalf of my delegation, i also welcome the state of tuvalu as a new member of our organization. last week, the millennium summit endorsed a historical declaration that laid out a strategy for meeting the challenges of the twenty-first century. today i should like to stress that it is our duty to concentrate, during this millennium assembly and through its different forums, on translating that vision into decisions and resolutions to achieve and 23 consolidate international peace and security, total disarmament of weapons of mass destruction, resolution of environmental problems, combating international terrorism and organized international crime, prevention of conflicts before they erupt and resolution of the problems of poverty and socio- economic backwardness. if we succeed during this session, we can then say that we have contributed to creating circumstances conducive to the achievement of human security and have liberated mankind from fear and want. on the other hand, we believe that this millennium assembly should give equal importance to the reform of the institutions of the united nations, as they represent the mechanisms through which the international community coordinates the implementation of plans for achieving international peace and security, comprehensive sustainable development and prosperity for mankind. at the apex of these institutions stands the security council. all countries continue to call for its reform by expanding its permanent and non-permanent membership, in order to make it more representative of the current membership of the united nations. they also call for reform of the council's working methods and decision-making mechanisms, in order to render it more democratic and transparent. we share the secretary-general's view, expressed in his report to the millennium summit, that the main challenge we face today is how to transform globalization into a positive power that benefits all the peoples of the world. the great scientific and technological achievements of the last millennium constitute the common heritage of mankind. we call on the international community to work out the necessary guarantees to prevent these achievements from being turned into a monopoly of knowledge or cultural and intellectual domination or from being used as a means to achieve political and economic hegemony or widen the scientific and technological gap between countries of the north and countries of the south. while we welcome protection of these scientific and technological achievements as elements of intellectual property, we call upon our development partners to make this great wealth available to all humanity and to enable the developing countries to use such innovations in overcoming the chronic problems of production, food, health, education and the environment. the right to development is a basic human right. in order to guarantee that right it is imperative that we establish a democratic, just and transparent world economic order that ensures fair terms of trade between poor and rich countries, increases the level of official development assistance to poor countries and alleviates the debt burden crushing those countries. this is the only viable means to enable the developing countries to benefit from the aspects and opportunities that globalization and the revolution in information technology offer benefits that are still monopolized by a very small minority of the population of our globe. in this regard, sudan looks forward to the united nations financing for development event and the third united nations conference on the least developed countries, which are scheduled to take place next year. we sincerely hope that their results will receive the effective implementation they deserve by all united nations agencies. this year the general assembly convened two special sessions to follow up the results of the beijing world conference on women and the copenhagen world summit for social development. despite the remarkable achievements realized by national governments and the international community in implementation of the commitments contained in the documents resulting from those gatherings, the majority of those commitments were not realized, for several reasons, foremost being the failure to fulfil the financial commitments undertaken in beijing and copenhagen and the excessive debt burden and debt service commitments of the developing and least developed countries. we also call for more support for efforts made by developing countries to eradicate ever-increasing poverty and all pandemic and epidemic diseases such as malaria and hiv/aids, especially in africa. sudan looks forward to participating effectively in the world conference against racism to be held next year in south africa. we believe that this important conference will help us tackle crucial issues very dear to the human race. my country also intends to participate in the special session of the general assembly to review the results and achievement of the goals of the world summit for children. recently, the president of the republic of sudan established an advisory body, attached to his office, in 24 charge of women's and children's affairs. this step is yet further proof of the special importance that the president attaches to the issues of women and children and his incessant work to strengthen achievements in this field. we view with great interest the report (a/55/305) of the panel of experts prepared by mr. brahimi on peacekeeping operations, because of its importance and the new ideas and proposals it contains on the containment and prevention of conflicts and on peacekeeping operations. our delegation will certainly participate in the discussion of this report in the general assembly and relevant committees. in this connection, we emphasize the need to set clear mandates for peacekeeping operations, ensuring the consent of the country receiving peacekeeping operations and providing the necessary resources for such operations in order to ensure their success and to avoid any possible dangers and setbacks. my delegation expresses its deep concern about the difficulties facing the peace process in the middle east. in this respect, we reiterate the importance of total israeli withdrawal from all occupied arab territories in accordance with united nations resolutions, in order to enable the palestinian people to restore full sovereignty to their territories, to establish their independent state with holy jerusalem as its capital and to enable the syrian arab republic to reinstate sovereignty over the golan heights. we are convinced that without implementation of these resolutions, stability in this important region will never be realized and will remain a mere dream. in this context, we commend the resistance and heroic struggle of the people of lebanon in the liberation of their territories. the call to reform the international sanctions regime is gaining more momentum within the security council and other united nations bodies, because the negative effects of sanctions have compounded the suffering of the peoples of the countries subjected to them, in particular vulnerable groups such as children, women and the elderly. the most horrible and dreadful aspects of the negative impacts of sanctions are seen among the iraqi people. we add our voice to ongoing efforts to lift these sanctions. sudan also reaffirms the importance of maintaining the unity and territorial integrity of iraq, and rejects any measures taken outside the scope of united nations resolutions and international legitimacy. at the same time, sudan reaffirms the need to respect and comply with all united nations resolutions and to respect the sovereignty of kuwait, and calls for a just and urgent solution to the issue of kuwaiti and non-kuwaiti prisoners, through cooperation and understanding between the parties concerned. we believe that it is high time to lift all sanctions imposed on the libyan arab jamahiriya, since it has complied with and fulfilled all its obligations regarding the lockerbie incident. we view with satisfaction the recent positive developments in the horn of africa, namely, the ceasefire agreement reached between our two sisterly neighbours, eritrea and ethiopia. we hope this agreement will culminate in a lasting peace between the two parties, and we should like to commend the efforts deployed by president bouteflika of algeria towards that end. we should also like to hail and commend the efforts of djibouti and its president ismail omar guelleh to achieve national reconciliation and restore stability to the republic of somalia. the sudan, represented by president omer hassan ahmed al-bashir, participated in the inauguration ceremony of abdihassim salad hassan as president of the republic of somalia. we call on the united nations and the international community to support efforts to restore peace, stability and security to somalia under its elected leadership. while we fully understand the concerns of the international community about the ongoing conflict in the southern sudan, we should like to recall that the sudan is waging a war imposed by a rebel movement seeking to undermine its territorial integrity and the safety and security of its people. we should also like to recall that it was the government of the sudan that initially invited the united nations to undertake the task of coordinating international humanitarian assistance for citizens affected by this conflict. ten years have elapsed since the implementation of the agreement known as operation lifeline sudan. however, it has had to be reviewed because of repeated violations of its terms by the rebel movement and some other organizations participating in this process. in this regard, it is my honour to express our deep appreciation and gratitude to secretary-general kofi annan and to his special envoy, ambassador tom 25 vraalsen, as well as to the personnel of the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (ocha) for the understanding they have shown regarding the government's demands for ensuring impartiality and transparency, as well as for determining the obligations of all parties to the agreement and ensuring the fair allocation of humanitarian assistance among citizens affected by the conflict on both sides. it is on the basis of this understanding that the government has committed itself to ensure the safety and protection of all relief agency personnel operating in the southern sudan. we believe it is our duty to brief the assembly on the current humanitarian situation in the bahr el ghazal area in the southern sudan, where the rebel movement has recently increased its violations of the partial ceasefire. this has created obstacles and security complications that impeded the delivery of humanitarian relief to affected citizens in that area. we therefore urge the assembly to bring pressure to bear on the rebel movement to stop using civilian populations and locations, such as hospitals and schools, as human shields and to fulfil its obligations by halting all military operations in order to ensure unhindered relief operations to all affected populations and to avert a humanitarian tragedy similar to the one endured by bahr el ghazal in the first quarter of 1998. the government of the sudan has reaffirmed its commitment to reach a just and lasting political solution to the conflict in the southern sudan based on the intergovernmental authority on development (igad) initiative and to respond to other initiatives intended to solve other problems. nonetheless, these peace efforts have not succeeded because of the intransigence of the rebel movement, which continues to renege on its obligations, undermining any agreement reached. this is clearly reflected in the position of the rebel movement regarding the ceasefire, which it continues to violate, as well as its continued rejection of the call by the government for a lasting, comprehensive ceasefire a call that has received wide support from the international community, the igad partners and several other united nations agencies, as well as regional and international groupings. president omer hassan ahmed al-bashir reaffirmed in his address to the millennium summit the commitment of the government of the sudan to a just and lasting political solution based on the following. first, there should be an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the needy and to create a conducive atmosphere and confidence-building measures for the success of the peace efforts. secondly, there should be direct negotiations on the basis of current peace initiatives, specifically, the igad process, which provides a negotiating forum for the government and the rebel movement, as well as the joint egyptian/libyan initiative, which is aimed at achieving a comprehensive resolution to all of the sudan's problems with the participation of the government, the rebel movement and the opposition in and outside the sudan. thirdly, a comprehensive peaceful settlement should be reached in order to lay the foundation for a fair distribution of power and wealth, establish rights and duties based on citizenship and guarantee total adherence to international standards and instruments of democracy and human rights. in addition to efforts being deployed to solve the military conflict in the southern sudan, the government continues to make efforts towards national reconciliation through direct and indirect contacts with opposition groups. agreement has been reached to hold a comprehensive national conference in which all political and social denominations and factions will take part in order to discuss national unity, freedom, democracy and the system of government. the conference is expected to agree on a national charter that will provide the basis for a system of government characterized by pluralism, freedoms and peaceful transfer of power. the government has taken the initiative of organizing a preparatory meeting for this conference in khartoum, and a national preparatory committee has been formed. this will be followed by another preparatory meeting to be held in cairo to determine the agenda, date and venue of the inclusive national conference. it is my pleasure to commend the efforts of the governments of egypt and the libyan arab jamahiriya in this regard. while efforts for peace and reconciliation are being pursued, the government is undertaking the necessary legal and administrative measures to establish a democratic, pluralistic system that provides all the necessary freedoms. the government is also preparing to hold parliamentary and presidential 26 elections, and has invited and welcomed the participation of international and regional organizations to supervise these elections. in the economic field, the government continues to implement programmes of reform and liberalization of the economy and is encouraging local and foreign investment. in this context, it is my pleasure to inform the assembly that the executive board of the international monetary fund decided at its meeting last august in washington to resume full cooperation with the sudan. the sudan has also managed to normalize its relations with other international and regional financial institutions, and hopes that the flow of foreign aid and foreign direct investment to the sudan will enable it to overcome its economic difficulties and relieve its debt burden. we have also started preparations to draw up a development strategy for the coming decade, which will concentrate on poverty alleviation and on providing basic health services, education and rural development. revenues from the export of petroleum will be earmarked for socio-economic development programmes. it has now been two years since the united states military aggression on the al-shifa pharmaceutical factory in the sudan, which resulted in the total destruction of an important medical facility that used to produce more than half of the sudan's needs for basic and life-saving medicines. the debris of that factory and the effects of the missile attack by the united states still bear witness to what happens when the military might of a super-power is used irresponsibly. it is ironic that the same super-power that claims to be a pioneer in protecting and safeguarding international peace and security and the principles of international law should resort to such an action. this gathering will recall that immediately after that aggression, the sudan called on the security council to send a fact-finding mission to verify united states allegations concerning the factory and its financing. yet despite the fact that the whole world, and indeed several media organizations inside the united states, have cast doubts on united states allegations about the al-shifa factory, the united states administration continues to maintain its position, contrary to all facts, thus insisting on justifying a wrong that has deprived the people of the sudan, especially the vulnerable and children, of a source of medicine at affordable prices less than half of what those medicines cost on the international market. convinced that rights do not die, we shall continue our efforts to urge the international community, the security council and the general assembly to send a mission to verify united states allegations, and we trust that our just cause has the support of all peace-loving countries that guard these noble principles. we wish here to call on the united states administration not to use its position in the security council to block the sending of a fact-finding mission that will show the world the truth and expose the unwarranted aggression against a basic health facility. the peaceful settlement of disputes is a principal objective and cardinal role of the united nations. the sudan adheres to this objective and seeks to realize it in the conduct of its foreign relations at all levels. based on this position, and in order to realize this noble objective, the sudan has continuously committed itself to respect for the norms of international law as the only way to settle disputes and to maintain international peace and security. the sudan is today one of only 62 states that have fully accepted the jurisdiction of the international court of justice. furthermore, the sudan, during the millennium summit, signed the 1998 rome statute of the international criminal court and deposited its instrument of ratification for the 1997 international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings. by ratifying this treaty, the sudan has become one of a few countries that have completed the process of ratification and adherence to all international conventions to combat international terrorism. this is indeed a source of pride to us. we believe the assembly will agree that this record qualifies the sudan to make all possible contributions to maintaining peace and security through the highest specialized institutions. since it became a member of the united nations following its independence in 1956, the sudan has continued to work in collaboration with the other member states in order to develop and sustain international cooperation to realize the objectives of the charter in all fields. the sudan looks forward to pursuing this role in another important forum as a non- permanent member of the security council for the period 2001-2002, for the first time in 28 years. 27 the candidature of sudan has been endorsed and supported by the african continent, represented in the african group in new york, as well as by the council of ministers of the organization of african unity (oau) at the oau summit in togo last july. the sudan looks forward with confidence and optimism to obtaining the support and endorsement of all united nations members for its candidature in the elections that will take place in the general assembly in the coming weeks.",Sudan,Africa,61.3458709716797,1.012179970741272,3225.0,8.0,0.0,8.0,2.4806201550387597
TGO,55,2000,"before discussing some of the concerns of the african continent and our views on some of the problems facing the united nations, i should like at the outset to congratulate you, mr. president, on having been chosen to guide the work of our world body at this important session. the high office to which you have risen in your country, finland, and the major role that finland plays in the world constitute a guarantee that the general assembly is truly in good hands. i wish also to pay tribute to our brother the secretary-general, mr. kofi annan, whose ability and dedication we highly appreciate. the general assembly session that took place 40 years ago was seen as the session of africa. it was at that session that many newly independent african countries participated in the work of united nations bodies for the first time as states members of the organization. yet despite the progress our continent has made over the past 40 years, africa continues to be weakened by the ills of underdevelopment. today, 33 of the world's 48 least developed countries are african countries. in other words, three fifths of the states of our continent belong to that group of countries that are lagging behind in the pursuit of development. as the world's least developed region, africa suffers from a number of specific ills which hamper its growth and for which it is important that the international community help provide a substantial, effective remedy. here i would first mention two pandemics that ravage the continent and whose human and economic consequences are particularly severe and alarming: aids and malaria. we are most grateful for the initiative taken last january by the security council to consider the question of aids in africa. more recently, the thirteenth international aids conference, held at durban, south africa, took stock of the situation regarding the advance of the epidemic and of possible ways to control it. members are undoubtedly aware that 70 per cent of the 34 million to 35 million aids sufferers worldwide live in sub- saharan africa, and that in some african countries schools have been closed because of the ravages of aids among the teachers. in a number of countries the skilled workforce has been considerably reduced by aids. the number of orphans in many countries affected by this epidemic is relatively high, thus exacerbating the economic and social situation of those countries. therefore, it is essential that the international community rapidly and genuinely mobilize in order to help the african continent control aids and eliminate its ravaging effects. with respect to malaria, a special summit of heads of state and government of the countries concerned was held on 24-25 april in abuja, nigeria, where a plan of action was adopted to combat the disease. malaria kills one person somewhere in the world every 30 seconds. the assembly of heads of state and government of the organization of african unity (oau), meeting in lome from 10-12 july this year, appealed to the united nations to proclaim the period 2001-2010 the decade to combat malaria. we firmly hope that this assembly will respond positively to our appeal, at this session, taking the necessary measures to ensure the decade's success. the african debt problem was also of concern to the oau heads of state and government at the lome summit. at a session more than 12 years ago, the african countries adopted a common position on the african foreign debt crisis. unfortunately, our continent continues to be the region of the world where the debt burden is heaviest. as the general assembly noted last year in resolution 54/202, `the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of heavily indebted developing countries' 5 are one of the factors that hinder their development and economic growth. this finding should motivate the international community, especially the developed countries and international financial institutions, to take more courageous measures, such as the outright cancellation of the african countries' debt. such a decision would greatly contribute to the success of the efforts of our countries, which have committed themselves to implementing sustained programmes to eradicate poverty. that is why we strongly support the proposals of secretary-general kofi annan, who believes that the industrialized countries should take a number of measures for the benefit of the african countries and other developing regions to ensure the possibility of their making significant progress in the new world economy. the african continent is grateful to the united nations development programme (undp) for its invaluable assistance over many years, resulting in the carrying out of numerous projects. however, the continuous decline in undp resources worries us, because it affects our development prospects. at a more global level, we note that major transnational companies, which play a crucial role in the world economy, are remarkably absent from united nations economic forums. as in the international labour organization (ilo), where representatives of governments, employers and employees work together, it is desirable that in the economic and social council representatives of governments should sit side by side with those of multinational companies. that would enhance the effectiveness and impact of this important united nations body. the international community, for its part, should prove, by decisive action, that it truly wishes to put an end to the suffering of the poorest peoples, the largest proportion of whom, unfortunately, are in africa. i take this opportunity to thank president bill clinton for having the united states congress approve a law making possible the establishment of a closer partnership between the united states of america and the african states. i also welcome the convening in cairo in april this year of the first africa-europe summit. we place a great deal of hope in such meetings, which can only strengthen the existing cooperation between the european union and the african countries. it is well known that our continent is not afflicted solely by the economic underdevelopment that puts it in last place in terms of the quality of life. it is also a region of the world where numerous lethal conflicts continue to sow death and desolation. consequently, africa accounts for the largest number of refugees and internally displaced persons. we are grateful to the united nations and its specialized agencies, particularly the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees, for their assistance in helping our continent to control various conflicts and mitigate their disastrous consequences. we must recognize very sadly, however, that, by comparison to other regions of the world that have also experienced bloody conflicts, the attention that our continent receives from the international community is somewhat meagre. we strongly urge the security council to demonstrate the same concern for us that it bestows on other regions of the world that have been affected by conflicts, inter alia, europe and asia. we subscribe to the relevant recommendations made by the panel of experts which the secretary- general has mandated to consider all problems related to the improved use of peace operations. we are of the view that the mandates of united nations peacekeeping missions should be clear, credible and achievable. these missions must be adequately financed and rapidly deployed where they are expected. they must be capable of fulfilling their mandates successfully and able to defend themselves and control all those who would seek to hinder their action on the ground. in the area of peacekeeping in africa, the organization of african unity (oau) has endowed itself over the years with valuable instruments for managing conflicts, such as the mechanism for conflict prevention, the conflict management centre and the early warning system. more than five years after the creation of these mechanisms, we believe that they should be complemented by the establishment of an operational and effective african peacekeeping force. if such a force were created, it would discourage all subversive actions that underpin conflicts. that is why i have proposed, with a view to strengthening that force, the establishment of an african institute for peace and conflict prevention, with the assistance of the united nations and the oau. this institution would train african cadres in the art of 6 negotiation, conflict management and the culture of peace. the persistence of conflicts in africa seriously affects the continent's opportunities for development and hampers its efforts to achieve unity. it was with a view to remedying this situation that the heads of state and government of the oau decided in syrte, libya, on 9 september 1999, to transform the oau into a new organization to be known as the african union. its charter was unanimously adopted at the 36th assembly of heads of state and government of the oau, held at lome last july. we are convinced that, with the birth of the african union, the continent will hasten its process of economic and political integration and strengthen the peace and solidarity that are indispensable to development. the general assembly was right to convene the millennium summit that was held here last week from 6 to 8 september. that historic conference was held to consider the role of the united nations in the world at the dawn of the twenty-first century. in my message to the millennium summit, i stressed two basic problems. one related to the activities of the united nations in the maintenance of international peace and security. the other concerned the stakes of development, particularly in relation to africa. when the organization was established 55 years ago, two thirds of its current members did not exist as sovereign states and their peoples still lived under the colonial yoke. the planet had a scant 2.5 billion inhabitants, as compared to 6 billion today. despite the expansion of the security council over the years, its composition has in truth remained virtually unchanged since the establishment of the united nations. to use the words of secretary-general kofi annan, this composition `does not fully represent either the character or the needs of our globalized world'. (a/52/2000, para. 44) we therefore think that it is high time to reconsider the composition of the security council, with a view to admitting new permanent members selected from the new economic powers that have emerged since the second world war, to which would be added regional powers from the developing countries. these are a few ideas that i wanted to contribute to this general debate. despite its imperfections and shortcomings, i think that the united nations is irreplaceable, but we must do everything possible to enhance its impact and influence. in conclusion, i would like to underscore that the african continent, despite its difficulties, continues to be a region of great potential wealth; however, its resources have inadequately been inventoried, developed and exploited. we must not despair and think that africa will not overcome these difficulties. we are resolved to do everything within our power to improve the political, economic and social situation of our continent. we simply need the benevolent assistance of all those who are today richer and are prepared to join us to bolster our efforts.",Togo,Africa,53.1776008605957,2.776449918746948,1834.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,2.7262813522355507
TCD,55,2000,"it was by unanimous vote that our assembly elected our president to be in charge of our work. whereas we are already aware of his professional skills and his human qualities, may i take the liberty of congratulating him and assuring him of the support and the cooperation of the delegation of chad to assist him in performing this difficult but very inspiring task. his predecessor, the minister for foreign affairs of fraternal namibia, very tactfully and effectively guided the work which was entrusted to him during the fifty-fourth session. he is now deserving of our congratulations. our words of congratulations and our encouragement are likewise addressed to our brother, mr. kofi annan, whose devotion to the cause of peace and development in the world undoubtedly represents a guarantee for the success of our organization. last year during a visit to the headquarters of the united nations development programme in new york, the president of the republic of chad, his excellency mr. idriss deby, declared: a new world is being built before our very eyes. new standards are being set which are giving lasting shape to the behaviours of individuals and relations among states. new technologies are pressing us forward to even greater progress in those societies which possess them. those which are closed to change are being marginalized, since they are incapable of making their ambitions come to life in the context of the new world. this frightening prospect, since it is synonymous with being left behind, is very real for many developing countries. but, i reject this prospect for my country. the president of the republic is here referring specifically to a world which is in constant change because of rampant globalization, which has become a fact of life that is sometimes highly praised for its benefits and sometimes shunned because of the harm it does. meanwhile in chad, men and women are doing everything they can to derive benefit from globalization and to avoid the downside in order not to miss the train of political, economic, social and technological progress. in other words, faced with the threat that globalization represents to stability, security and development of the weaker, chad is waging an out and out struggle to occupy its proper place in the concert of nations. yes, the men and women of chad are struggling courageously and with resolve to emerge from obscurantism, from poverty and from domination. the results of their daily struggle speak for themselves when you look at what has been achieved in the various 36 areas of national life. politically, the democratic experiment which began on 1 december 1990 is being further developed and consolidated. thus, political pluralism is functioning while respecting diversity on the basis of consensual and participatory democracy. the various fundamental freedoms which underlie and which breathe life into any democratic political system are being fully exercised. the freedom of expression of the private press, which gives no quarter in its criticism of the action of the government, as well as the burgeoning of associations of civil society, particularly those dealing with human rights, young people and women, bears witness to the political determination of the government of chad to promote a culture of democracy. in this connection, particular attention should be paid to strengthening the role of women in public life, as well as the rights of and the protection of children. likewise, through the establishment of a supreme court, a constitutional council and a superior council of judges, the final touches have been put on the judicial institutions that underpin our democratic system. furthermore, i am pleased to recall that the first multi- party elections took place in chad in 1996 in a climate of calm and transparency, as the international observers noted. the next elections will take place in six months. in general, the political authorities in chad are doing all they can to ensure their success. i would therefore like to emphasize from this rostrum that chad's attachment to pluralistic democracy cannot be unseated, because the people of chad as a whole are profoundly convinced that this is the only way indeed their unique opportunity to improve their living conditions. the most recent meetings in syrte, libya, and the various declarations made by chadian political actors are all encouraging signs that, as we would like, this attachment is firm. in all events, the government of chad welcomes these new arrangements, which are to be seen as part and parcel of the policy of outreach that has been advocated by his excellency mr. idriss deby, the president of the republic of chad. after gaining this hard-won peace and this firm attachment to democracy, the government of chad quite naturally then proceeded with the support of international institutions and chad's bilateral partners to tackle the question of economic and social development. a genuine plan to fight poverty has been created. this plan includes the elaboration of a national strategy for the reduction of poverty. this strategy has been further strengthened by the fact that the objectives of poverty reduction and economic growth during the 2000-2002 period have been made part of the major, high-priority social and sectoral programmes that were adopted at the geneva iv round table on the development of chad. part of this struggle against poverty is the struggle that the people of chad have waged to complete the project for the extraction and export of its oil. this success was achieved thanks to the determination of the president of the republic, his excellency mr. idriss deby but also thanks to unflagging support of the bretton woods institutions and of friends and other partners of chad. here we would like these supporters to know that the government and people of the republic of chad recognize and are grateful for their assistance. chad nevertheless does not see its development and even less its security and stability in an isolated fashion. therefore chad is doing everything possible to make its contribution to creating a climate of peace and prosperity in africa particularly in central africa. the subregion of central africa despite its immense potential, and perhaps because of this immense potential, i might add now appears to be the region of upheaval par excellence, a region characterized by armed conflicts and crises of all sorts. undoubtedly some hotbeds of tension have been slaked. this is true of the central african republic and of the republic of the congo, which are gradually regaining their stability. but this stability remains fragile. the international community therefore must help these countries to consolidate this peace by actions in support of reconstruction and assistance. two other conflicts, unfortunately, persist and also dangerously threaten the subregion. one of these is the conflict occurring in the democratic republic of the congo, where the belligerents' failure to respect the lusaka agreement has unfortunately resulted in exacerbating the rivalries among the foreign forces in the congolese territory, further complicating the situation and holding up the effective implementation of that agreement. as far as the angolan conflict is concerned, it has certainly become even more complex because of its duration, the resources that nurture it and all the 37 international complicity that mr. jonas savimbi has taken advantage of. but we must support the efforts of the legitimate and legal government of angola, as well as the efforts of the international community, so that this long-suffering people can recover the peace and tranquillity that they have not known since they acceded to independence. in the framework of the united nations standing advisory committee on security questions in central africa, the states of this subregion have not remained inactive. they are devoting themselves to exploring ways and means of establishing peace and tranquillity through measures designed first and foremost to create trust among themselves. the first of these steps is the possibility offered by the periodic meetings of the committee. these provide an opportunity for political dialogue in the interest of preventive diplomacy. for having created this committee, the security council is deserving of our gratitude. furthermore, structures and mechanisms to promote peace and stability are gradually being established. among others, we might note the establishment of an early-warning mechanism in libreville and of the subregional centre for human rights and democracy in yaounde. the creation of the council for peace and security in central africa is under way with the signing, by the heads of state or government, on 24 february at malabo, equatorial guinea, of the protocol regarding this council and the mutual assistance pact. in the area of security there is a plan to organize a joint military exercise for the peacekeeping operations of the armed forces of the states of the subregion. as for the other contributor to instability the proliferation of small arms and light weapons the member states held a subregional conference on this topic in n'djamena in october 1999. a number of measures were advocated; among them, we might mention the project of arms for development, which was initiated by canada and certain donor countries a project that is intended to set up micro-projects to help those who turn in their arms. for the time being this project involves the areas along the borders of cameroon, the central african republic and chad. in this connection, a mission of evaluation visited the countries concerned in july 2000. the initiative is only at the conceptual stage, but it is to be hoped that it will take concrete form as soon as possible. i would therefore like to make an appeal to the other partners to join with canada in order to broaden the scope of these projects to include the entire subregion. instability and insecurity in central africa are also among the major causes of refugee flows, a phenomenon that has spared no state. aware as we are of the negative effects of this phenomenon, member states took this matter up during a conference that was held last august in bujumbura. the relevant conclusions of this conference deserve to be supported. the political situations in other subregions of the african continent also concern us. certainly there has been a definite improvement with the consolidation of democratic institutions, good governance and respect for the fundamental rights of the african people. nevertheless, several crises are persisting and must be a subject of concern for the entire international community. thus in west africa, sierra leone has not yet achieved peace, despite the commitments entered into by the parties to the conflict. chad, for its part, gives its total support to the efforts of the economic community of west african states (ecowas) and the united nations to seek peace in this embattled country. likewise, we have every confidence in ecowas to smooth out the difficulties between liberia and guinea. with regard to the conflict between ethiopia and eritrea, his excellency president idriss deby has personally dealt with this matter as current president of the community of the sahel and saharan states by setting up a good offices mission to the leaders of the two fraternal countries, in support of the mediation by the organization of african unity (oau). the government of chad is very pleased to see that the two parties have finally reached a peace agreement. we encourage them to respect their individual commitments in order to bring lasting peace to this part of the african continent. regarding the somali crisis, chad welcomes the fact that the people of somalia have awakened to their destiny through the recent conference of national reconciliation which was held in alta, djibouti, thus demonstrating courage and imagination in their determination to endow their countries with republican institutions. the international community must help them and encourage them to build further on this initiative in order to reach total and just peace. 38 the presence here of a delegation bearing the name of the republic of somalia, whose seat has been vacant for almost 10 years now, is a matter of pride and satisfaction for the friends and the partners of this fraternal people. it is an example that should edify our brothers of the comoros and burundi. we should also congratulate the government of djibouti for their contribution and devotion to the cause of peace in the subregion. we believe it is time to lift completely the embargo against the great socialist people's libyan arab jamahiriya, because it is no longer justified and arbitrarily penalizes the fraternal libyan people and, indeed, beyond them the entire subregion. chad has not lost sight of the crisis situations prevailing in other parts of the world. in the middle east, it is following with interest the negotiations underway between the palestinian and israeli authorities and believes that the time for the peace of the worthy has now come. the parties to the conflict should seize this historic opportunity and, as president clinton said: the world should help them to take the risk of embarking on peace. in iraq, chad believes it is urgent to put an end to the embargo whose consequences have been so disastrous for the civilian population, which is suffering the atrocious evils resulting from this unjust decision. quite clearly any solution should also cover the very pertinent matter of the prisoners from kuwait and other countries. the korean peninsula is showing encouraging signs of the two fraternal countries drawing closer to each other. the historic inter-korean summit, which took place between the leaders of these countries last june, has laid the foundation for trusting relationships that are so central for any dialogue. the international community should encourage both of these countries to press on in order to eventually sign a peace agreement which would pave the way to peaceful coexistence. the inter-korean dialogue might also arouse some interest on the part of the taiwan strait where tension unfortunately continues to be abnormally high. whereas economic and trade relations between the two countries are being developed on a regular basis, political relations are non-existent, despite the fact that on both sides of the strait semi-official structures have been set up which serve as channels of communication between the people's republic of china and the republic of china, taiwan. both parties should show political determination and imagination in exploring ways and means of reducing tension and opening a genuine dialogue. in all events, the international community is duty bound to reconsider the whole question of admitting the republic of china, taiwan to membership of our organization, particularly in light of the weight and the importance of the economic role it plays internationally and the fact that it is so closely involved in actions for development and the reduction of poverty. for its part, the government of chad supports the request by the republic of china, taiwan, to seek membership in the united nations and its specialized agencies. i could not conclude my remarks without referring to other ills which undermine and sap all the development efforts of countries like mine. these ills include indebtedness, protectionist measures in the markets of the northern countries, deterioration in the terms of trade and various kinds of trafficking. those countries which hold the key to the solutions to all these ills, particularly the northern countries, must go beyond simple declarations of intention and take concrete steps to relieve countries from the burden of indebtedness, to throw open their markets and to pay a fair price for our exports. as if this were not enough, another evil which is even more insidious and devastating, has made our task even more difficult. the prospects for solution are remote indeed and it is to be feared that this will reduce to nothing our hopes to relieve our peoples of poverty. i refer to the hiv/aids pandemic which brings death and bereavement to families on a daily basis. not only is it a burden for our meagre financial resources, but also on our human resources, particularly young people who are the spearhead of our nation. we have the collective responsibility to effectively mobilize ways and means to conquer this scourge which defies the entire international community as a time when there is so much technological and scientific progress being made. 39 in the light of all these challenges, chad believes that its development should also benefit from the political and economic integration of africa, which is an important and determinant dimension of this global village. therefore we would welcome and salute the major political acts which have been taken by the conference of heads of state and government of the organization of african unity (oau) on 12 july in lome: i refer to the adoption of the constituent act of the african union. this major historic event, which is the result of a collective commitment on the part of the african peoples, is a responsible reply on the part of today's africa to meet the number of challenges of the twenty- first century by means of political, economic and social integration. the african union will create the necessary conditions for genuine partnership in irreversible globalization, but a globalization that would not be synonymous with exclusion and the dictatorship of the marketplace. this globalization, we believe, should be synonymous with sharing and openness. it should have a human face or it will not exist at all. but none of this can be achieved without further democratization of the united nations starting with an enlargement of the security council so that it can be more effective and, particularly, more legitimate. in other words, it is in our interest in the interest of us all that the security council be more representative of the international community in whose name it claims to act. what we are referring to here is the credibility of its decisions which, unfortunately, have long been used against the weaker with its policy of double standards.",Chad,Africa,25.6542091369629,2.64670991897583,2965.0,6.0,0.0,6.0,2.023608768971332
LSO,55,2000,"on behalf of the government and people of lesotho, i extend our most sincere congratulations to the president on his election to preside over the fifty-fifth session, and wish him every success in the discharge of his duties. we are confident that his personal, diplomatic and leadership qualities will guide us through the session, and assure him of our support and cooperation at all times. let me also pay a well deserved tribute, and express our thanks and gratitude, to his predecessor, our colleague, minister theo-ben gurirab of namibia. we thank him in particular for his statesmanship, sterling guidance and effective organization during the difficult times of the fifty-fourth session. we also remain deeply indebted to secretary- general kofi annan for his continued dynamic leadership and commitment to our organization, and for his relentless efforts in achieving the organization's goals. the admission of a new member to our organization is always a moment of joy, and that of tuvalu is no exception. 19 this, the first session of the general assembly in the new millennium, offers an opportunity for us to reflect on the challenges and threats we face as we enter the new century, a century that has ushered in a revolution that future generations will likely characterize as one that had the greatest impact on human civilization since the advent of the telegraph, radio and television. the world is indeed witnessing a revolution in the information systems and their integration into the lives of men, women and children, leading to the term information age . the information age of the twenty-first century is taking root as it impacts on the lives of all sectors of society at both the national and international levels. there can be no doubt that for some information technology and globalization are beginning to turn theoretical possibilities into fact, as the use of computers and computer-dependent systems have resulted in improvements in basic health conditions and increases in life expectancy, efficiency and productivity, thus offering tremendous economic potential and prosperity. unfortunately, the majority of others who have been left out of that prosperity continue to live in conditions of extreme poverty, remain embroiled in unending conflicts and are ravaged by the hiv/aids pandemic and other diseases. the challenge for the united nations of the twenty-first century is to eliminate those disparities by bringing poor countries into the digital age, thus making them extract value from globalization instead of watching globalization extract value from them. education remains the key for the attainment of these objectives. in fact, our message from lesotho here is: education, education, education. a disturbing phenomenon for the international community, and in particular for africa, is that while the rest of the world is experiencing an increased flow of financial resources africa's development prospects continue to be hampered by unsustainable debt servicing obligations. just as we have placed poverty eradication at the centre of economic and social development, it is equally necessary to accord similar importance to the debt problems of developing countries. in our view, that would be a vital contribution to the realization of the goal of halving the proportion of people whose income is less than $1 a day by 2015. lesotho falls into the category of countries that are not eligible for debt relief under the existing framework. in our millennium summit declaration we made pledges to grant more generous development assistance to poor countries that plan to apply their resources to poverty reduction and to deal comprehensively with their debt problems. we need to concretize these pledges by adopting measures to accelerate debt relief such as the cancellation of the official debt of those countries and the expansion of the heavily indebted poor countries debt initiative. this would assist us in ensuring that by 2015 the majority of our people have access to safe drinking water, that all children complete a full course of primary education, and that joblessness is reduced among our youth. it would also help us curb the spread of hiv/aids and assist the children orphaned by this scourge. the government of lesotho adopted poverty reduction as its highest development priority in its sixth and seventh national development plans. we have taken firm measures to reduce poverty. based on our democratic dispensation and peaceful environment, we have successfully embarked on an aggressive investment promotion campaign for job creation. i am pleased to report that we are experiencing initial success in attracting foreign investment. we believe that south-south cooperation is an important tool for developing and strengthening the economic independence of developing countries. to this end, we in southern africa have made modest but encouraging progress with respect to south-south cooperation by accelerating the entry into force of the southern african development community (sadc) trade protocol, which encompasses deeper economic cooperation, cross-border investment and trade, free movement of factors of production, and free movement of goods and services. the third united nations conference on the least developed countries, to be held in brussels next year, is both timely and crucial. since this body recognized, some years ago, the least developed countries as the poorest of the developing countries, there has not yet been any improvement in the weak economic situation of those countries, whose numbers have instead increased from 25 in 1971, to 48 in 1997. lesotho therefore looks forward to the conference, which will review the internal constraints to the development of the least developed countries and 20 the adequacy of international support measures in the critical areas of official development assistance, debt relief, market access and trade. the high-level international intergovernmental event on financing for development, to be held in 2001, will come to naught unless we are resolved to undertake it armed with the requisite political commitment and global solidarity to achieve our development goals nationally, regionally and internationally. the government of lesotho remains keenly aware that good environmental management requires concerted efforts from all members of the community. therefore, we have established partnerships at the international, regional and national levels to address the problems of environmental degradation. we believe that the environment is too important an issue to be left in the hands of one organization. in this regard, we look forward to the process of the 10-year review of the united nations conference on environment and development (unced), at which we will share our experiences with, and learn from, our counterparts in the international community. regarding the integrated and coordinated implementation of, and follow-up to, the major united nations conferences and summits, my delegation values the review meetings because they offer us the opportunity to evaluate our performance and to consider the way forward. they also rekindle our political commitment to achieving global developmental goals. we therefore feel that the review process should continue in the twenty-first century, with a stronger emphasis on the evaluation of achievements and constraints. like globalization of the economy, globalization of human rights cannot be avoided. today human rights are well established as the legitimate concern of all humanity. if, as the world agreed in vienna in 1993, the promotion and protection of all human rights is a legitimate concern of the international community (a/conf/157/24,chapter iii, section i, para.4), this calls for a more pragmatic approach in identifying pertinent situations requiring the protection of humanity, including in situations where a state has collapsed or disintegrated. among the promising developments as we begin the century is the growing world consensus on the need to stop impunity by punishing those responsible for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, as evidenced by the number of signatories and ratifications to the statute of the international criminal court (icc). this momentum has rekindled our hope for peace and for an end to the persistence of human rights violations. lesotho's ratification of the icc statute is a further clear indication of its commitment to the protection of human rights and to bringing to justice all those who commit gross violations of these rights. as we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the united nations fourth world conference on women, we must be reminded that the goal of gender equality is far from being achieved. despite pessimistic forecasts, and despite different evaluations of the achievements of the special session on women, the beijing + 5 conference's adoption of a final document proposing a series of actions and initiatives in the 12 critical areas identified in beijing is an indication of the international community's renewed commitment to women's rights. implementation of the norms enshrined in the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women remains critical for the attainment of the goals set in beijing. as technology brings the peoples of the world closer together, thus removing political and other barriers, societies continue to be ravaged by racial discrimination, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, exemplified by ethnic cleansing, racial hatred and new forms of slavery. a challenge for the united nations is to define goals and global strategies focused on urgent and effective measures to eliminate racial discrimination and ethnic conflicts. lesotho thus welcomes the convening of the world conference against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, to be held in south africa in 2001. this conference will offer an opportunity for us to develop action-oriented measures to rid the world of these scourges. preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction nuclear, chemical and biological remains one of the most important tasks facing humankind in the twenty-first century, as these weapons remain a major threat to world peace. the pursuit of arms reduction and the challenge of achieving sustainable disarmament thus remain the 21 only bulwark against the use or threat of use of weapons of mass destruction. while we welcome the nuclear-weapon states' undertaking to eliminate their nuclear arsenals, their failure to agree to a specific timetable for doing so is regrettable. the challenge is to translate these undertakings into concrete actions to eliminate all nuclear dangers. we thus support the secretary- general's call for a new international conference on eliminating nuclear dangers as a means of advancing our disarmament goals. we also remain convinced of the need and desirability of convening a special session of the general assembly devoted to disarmament. thanks to the efforts of all actors, both governmental and non-governmental, the world is beginning to witness tangible results as the production, trade and use of landmines slowly drops, thus lowering the number of casualties. this, however, should not lead to any complacency, as evidence of the use of mines in some conflict areas, particularly in africa, continues to surface. we look forward to a day when the world will be free of these weapons and encourage all those who continue to use mines, as well as those who remain outside the convention banning landmines, to heed the rapidly growing international and regional momentum for the ban on those weapons. lesotho supports the convening of a united nations conference on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects in june and july 2001, as mandated by general assembly resolution 54/54. we share the view that the outcome of the conference should be a global action plan with specific timetables for the implementation of commitments on issues such as codes of conduct, legislative and regulatory measures, control, enforcement, transparency, and tracing measures and mechanisms. the proliferation of armed conflicts in africa continues to hamper efforts to achieve progress in economic and social development. the lack of political will to find lasting solutions to ongoing conflicts and the emergence of new ones continues to effectively cripple the productive activities of those countries as well as further erode the poor social infrastructure that exists in many countries. the illicit trade in arms, diamonds and other natural resources, as well as the diversion of resources from development to military activities, continue to fuel these conflicts, thus undermining democracy and development. the challenge for africa remains the management and resolution of conflicts, the avoidance of war and the strengthening of democratic institutions. these are enormous challenges which require africa's commitment to stability and the rule of law, but, above all, they require strong political will on the part of the africans themselves and resources from the international community to reinforce democratic government, to deter attempts to overthrow it and even to reinstate it where it has been overthrown by illegal means. we in lesotho have bitter experience of attempts to overthrow a legally and democratically elected government. thanks to our sadc partners, order has been restored in lesotho and the government is vigorously pursuing a programme of reconstruction, which includes the creation of a climate of political reconciliation on which the consolidation of democratic gains and democratic culture can rest. the government of lesotho remains fully committed to developing a culture of democracy, good governance, observance of human rights and constitutionality. the international community's assistance remains indispensable to the success of these efforts. we therefore stand solidly behind the position held by the organization of african unity, sadc and the commonwealth of disallowing governments that come into power by illegal means from participating in our councils. this should include our councils in the united nations. despite positive steps being taken by the government of angola to stabilize the situation in that country, peace continues to elude the people of angola because of the non-fulfilment by jonas savimbi of the lusaka protocol. we urge the international community to observe all security council resolutions against unita and to fully cooperate with the united nations to ensure the effective implementation of sanctions against unita. we appeal to all parties to the congolese conflict to honour their obligations under the lusaka ceasefire agreement and to lend their support to the process of internal dialogue under the facilitation of sir ketumile masire of botswana. we support all measures aimed at ending the illicit trade in diamonds in sierra leone and applaud the economic community of west african states for its efforts to bring peace to that country. we are 22 gratified to see the cessation of hostilities between ethiopia and eritrea and call on both parties to that conflict to redouble their efforts for a lasting peace. we also urge all armed groups in burundi to fully and effectively participate in the negotiations so as to facilitate the speedy conclusion of a ceasefire agreement and a comprehensive peace accord. we look forward to the conclusion of the process in western sahara so that the people of that country can freely determine their own future. we reaffirm the right of the palestinian people to exercise their inalienable rights and we urge parties to the middle east peace process to redouble their efforts to find durable peace in the middle east. the real test for the united nations in this century is how far it is prepared to go in addressing all these challenges and how far it will go in turning promises into reality, thus enabling the large majority of the people of the world to fulfil their potential and realize their aspirations. while we appreciate the magnitude of these challenges, we continue to have faith in the united nations capacity to solve global problems, its broad universal support and its ability to uphold and reaffirm our shared values of peace, equity, social justice, democracy and human rights.",Lesotho,Africa,86.2544326782227,10.09154987335205,2548.0,11.0,0.0,11.0,4.3171114599686025
KEN,55,2000,"let me begin by congratulating the president on behalf of my delegation on his unanimous election to lead the fifty-fifth regular session of the general assembly. i am confident that his able leadership and vast diplomatic experience will steer the business of this session of the general assembly to the desired outcome. i also wish to express my delegations gratitude to his predecessor, minister theo-ben gurirab of namibia, for the able manner in which he presided over the work of our previous session. i commend the secretary-general, mr. kofi annan, whose commitment in shaping the united nations to meet the challenges of the new millennium has won the respect and admiration of many. i particularly commend him for his selfless dedication to duty and encourage him to continue serving the international community with the same zeal. the proliferation of conflicts in africa continues to pose serious threats to peace, security and stability. conflicts have had a negative impact on the continents development capacity and continue to undermine efforts to improve the living standards of our peoples. they have caused considerable destruction and loss of lives, generated millions of refugees and displaced persons and exacerbated famine conditions in areas such as the southern sudan and the horn of africa. africa recognizes the primary role of the united nations in the maintenance of international peace and security. it also recognizes the need for cooperation between the united nations and regional organizations in peacekeeping and peace-building. such efforts have yielded positive results in some countries. however, there are others, such as the democratic republic of the congo, where the united nations has been slow to act. positive regional initiatives have been recorded in the cessation of armed hostilities between ethiopia and eritrea, under the auspices of the organization of african unity (oau). we commend the parties for the maturity they have demonstrated. we urge both parties to the conflict to uphold the ceasefire while working towards a final negotiated settlement of that dispute. the united nations is urged to speedily discharge its duty along that common border. the establishment last month of a transitional national assembly and the election of the president of the republic of somalia was indeed a momentous occasion. i pay tribute to president ismail omar guelleh of djibouti for his mediation efforts and his steadfast commitment to the cause of peace in somalia. i call upon the international community to continue providing support and humanitarian assistance to the somali nation. i also hope that the recently concluded accord on burundi will bring to an end the seven-year- old civil war and enable the people of that country to redirect their efforts towards reconstruction and development. the recent unfortunate experience in sierra leone calls for a review of peacekeeping operations, particularly with regard to the safety, commissioning and deployment of troops. kenya supports the recent initiative aimed at curbing the trade in illicit diamonds, which fuels and sustains conflicts in africa. kenya welcomes the decision by the security council authorizing the establishment of an international criminal court to try those responsible for atrocities committed in the civil war in sierra leone. it should signal to the rebels there and elsewhere that the international community will not tolerate acts against humanity. turning to disarmament and international security, we are disappointed that the conference on disarmament for the second year running has not undertaken any substantive work. this situation is particularly disturbing, since the conference is the sole multilateral disarmament negotiating forum. the conference has for a considerable period of time been expected to conduct serious negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty and a treaty on nuclear disarmament. this assembly has in various resolutions urged the conference on disarmament to undertake such negotiations. during its fifty-fourth session, for instance, the general assembly passed four resolutions which, inter alia, called on the conference to get down to serious work. the lack of progress at the conference is due to the reluctance of key nuclear-weapon states to submit themselves to negotiate in good faith, despite their obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. we still expect the nuclear-weapon states to honour their commitment to undertake genuine nuclear disarmament, which they renewed during the 2000 review conference of the parties to the treaty. failure of the conference on disarmament will send the wrong signal to non-nuclear-weapon states and might well encourage those with nuclear ambitions to join that club. after the end of the cold war, there is no longer any justification for maintaining nuclear arsenals, if there ever was one. kenya calls on the nuclear countries to preserve outer space as a nuclear-free zone. the serious security problem posed by the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons is a matter of grave concern to kenya. we hosted in march this year the great lakes region and horn of africa conference on the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons. the conference, attended by 10 states of the region, adopted the nairobi declaration, which calls for greater cooperation and information- sharing between law enforcement and border control officials of states in our region, as well as the strengthening and/or adoption of national laws and control mechanisms governing civilian possession of arms, and urges source countries to regulate weapons and arms transactions through strict licensing. the nairobi conference was an important initiative. kenya is in the process of organizing a follow-up meeting later this year. in the same vein, i should like to express our full support for the international conference on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects, scheduled for 2001. we hope that that conference will adequately address our concerns. a consequence of conflicts and the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons has been the massive movement of refugees across borders. kenya continues to host a large number of such refugees. this has put a heavy strain on our own scarce national resources. i am happy to note that the government of kenya is in the process of finalizing the refugee bill 2000 in order to address the refugee phenomenon. the bill is a result of joint efforts between the government of kenya, the united nations high commissioner for refugees and other stakeholders. it will provide refugees with a better legal framework in which to live and exercise their rights. kenya would like to see an end to the disparity in the treatment of refugees globally. we have noted with concern the bewildering inconsistency in the responses to the refugee problems in other parts of the world compared with those in africa. we hope that in future the international community will respond in a fair and consistent manner to refugee crises in all parts of the world. the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms is firmly on the international agenda. in kenya the government effort is geared towards enhancing public awareness of existing rights and freedoms. in this regard, the government has prepared a bill seeking to establish an independent human rights commission to monitor and protect human rights. that commission would also advise the government on its international obligations on the protection and promotion of human rights. during the last session of the assembly i commended the high commissioner for human rights for adopting a proactive approach to human rights issues. we continue to stress that human rights should be addressed in a global context through a dialogue- based approach. in this way, we will realize wider acceptance and observance of human rights. the rise in transnational networks of crime, narcotics, money laundering and terrorism is another matter of grave concern to us. the effects of the august 1998 terrorist bombing in nairobi are still evident in our economy and in the lives of kenyans. we have undertaken measures to contain this menace by establishing special policing units and strict control of movement on border areas and other national entry points. we are also collaborating with international security agencies, such as interpol, and have signed extradition treaties with a number of states. we call for concerted efforts to adopt effective international measures to eradicate the growing and dangerous links between terrorist groups, drug traffickers and armed criminal groups. the struggle against terrorism can only succeed if there is cooperation between all countries to track down and apprehend wanted terrorists. kenya supports the initiative to restructure and revitalize the united nations in the economic, social and related fields. we stress that the promotion of development should remain a central priority of the organization. the process of reforming the economic and social council should be expedited by organizing its work throughout the year and reinforcing its role in providing overall policy guidance for operational development programmes and funds. kenya supports the implementation of policies that foster economic growth in developing countries in order to bridge the widening gap between rich and poor. my delegation urges the united nations and the bretton woods institutions to ensure the facilitation of stronger and more equitable international multilateral development cooperation designed to address the growing problems in economic development. we are all aware of the challenging task of eradicating poverty consistent with the overall objectives and strategies agreed in the copenhagen declaration and the programme of action adopted at the world summit for social development and with the outcome of the millennium summit. kenya supports and continues to implement the copenhagen declaration and the programme of action. this commitment is manifested in our governments determination to establish a firm policy and institutional framework for mainstreaming the poverty eradication agenda. the formulation of the national poverty eradication plan is a step towards focusing national policies and operational priorities on the poor, as well as providing an enabling environment for them to participate in economic and social development. further, the government of kenya has developed an interim poverty reduction strategy paper, which has been prepared in consultation with all stakeholders. the strategy paper outlines measures designed to improve economic performance, while identifying key actions to reduce the prevalence of poverty. the above measures are part of the kenya governments strategy to restore economic growth while maintaining economic stability. economic reforms are gaining momentum and are expected to lead to a progressive increase in real per capita growth. currently, the country is facing a severe drought, the worst in our countrys history. this is having a debilitating effect on our economy. we appreciate the assistance received so far from the international community and seek continued support to deal with the situation. globalization poses enormous challenges to developing countries, and ours is no exception. kenya welcomes initiatives that protect the weaker states from the adverse effects of globalization. the ability of african countries to participate effectively, exercise their rights and meet their obligations in the world trade organization (wto) is an important determinant in their integration into the international trading system. my delegation is concerned about the growing protectionism manifested in attempts to support a new round of multilateral trade negotiations within the context of the wto. kenya is firmly opposed to the introduction of new protectionist barriers to trade camouflaged as labour, health and environmental standards. at the same time, we urge the implementation of special and differential provisions in respect of developing and least developed countries because of their low levels of industrialization and the vulnerable nature of their economies. the increased globalization of financial markets and capital flows poses new challenges for the mobilization of adequate resources. kenya shares the concerns of developing countries over the general decline in official development assistance and the free flow of foreign direct investment to developing countries. portfolio investment, which tends to be volatile and unpredictable, as experienced during the 1997 financial crisis, is a source of financial instability. we support the creation of a new international financial architecture for a more stable financial system. the global market environment poses enormous challenges, and there is an urgent need for supportive international policies that will ensure the financial systems efficient functioning. the slow progress in africas attainment of sustainable economic growth is linked to the failure to mobilize resources. this has been aggravated by internal conflicts and the prevalence of diseases such as malaria and the hiv/aids pandemic, which in themselves have a causal relationship with poverty and deprivation. my country, in collaboration with international agencies, is zealously pursuing scientific research to find a cure for malaria and the hiv/aids pandemic. we call upon the international community to support our research efforts to find a cure for these diseases, which continue to ravage millions. kenya wishes to stress the need to ensure the easy availability of existing drugs to those already afflicted. given that information technologies are important prerequisites for development, the developed countries should direct resources to accelerate the development of information technology in africa. in this regard, kenya welcomes the okinawa charter initiative of the g-8 countries and looks forward to the implementation of its aims. my delegation notes the commitment made by the g-8 to speed up the pace of implementation of the enhanced highly indebted poor countries debt initiative, in line with the targets agreed at the cologne summit. however, the initiative suffers from a lack of commitment to implementation and should be reviewed with a view to being speeded up. we share the concerns, expressed by the leaders from developing countries who attended the okinawa g-8 summit, on the impact of the debt burden to poverty alleviation efforts. debt repayment in sub-saharan africa is to the detriment of health, education and other essential services. kenya urges creditor countries to honour pledges for debt relief and increase balance of payment support to developing countries. kenya attaches special importance to south- south cooperation. it is in recognition of the important role of economic cooperation among developing countries that we continue actively to pursue economic integration with countries in our own subregion. the relationship between regional and subregional economic groupings is seen within the framework of the african economic community, which kenya fully supports. the institutions established in 1945 are overdue for an overhaul. the world political, economic and security landscape has changed, and so must these institutions. the united nations must become a truly universal organization, democratic and representative of the many diverse interests. its organs should reflect this rich diversity, with effective representation and participation at all levels of decision-making. the general assembly has to reassert its role within the organization. the security council must also reflect the principle of equitable geographical representation and the realities of our times. kenya seeks to have permanent seats on the security council allotted for africa, to be filled by african countries on a rotational basis and on the same footing as existing permanent seats. the transformation of institutions dealing with other issues is equally overdue if we are to re-energize the efficacy and effectiveness of the united nations, as called for in the millennium declaration. kenya appreciates the increased utilization of the united nations office at nairobi. we are nevertheless dissatisfied with the level of involvement with environment and human settlement issues. there is a huge, under-utilized capacity in the nairobi offices. it should be noted also that the nairobi declaration adopted by member states in february 1997 declared the united nations environment programme (unep) to be the principal body in the field of environment. kenya is therefore totally opposed to the creation of new institutions with similar concerns and calls upon the international community to strengthen the role of unep and the united nations centre for human settlements (habitat) in nairobi. in conclusion, kenya fully embraces the spirit of the millennium declaration, with a pledge to make its modest contribution in the general service of a happier family of nations.",Kenya,Africa,82.2290802001953,5.186729907989502,2619.0,8.0,0.0,8.0,3.0546009927453226
NAM,56,2001,"the fifty-sixth session of the general assembly is no ordinary one. we are meeting in the aftermath of the despicable terrorist attacks on new york, the seat of the united nations, washington, d.c., and pennsylvania. once again, we express our deep condolences to the government and the people of the united states. our thoughts go out to the families of those who lost their loved ones in those tragic and horrific events of 11 september. namibia reiterates its unreserved condemnation of these and all other terrorist attacks, wherever they occur. in the same vein, we express our condolences to the families of those who perished in the american airlines accident on 12 november. we also convey our condolences to the government and the people of the dominican republic. namibia also expresses its heartfelt sympathy to the government and the people of algeria as they mourn the deaths of those killed by the violent storm and mudslides there. our thoughts go out to their families. i would like to congratulate mr. han seung-soo on his unanimous election as president of the general assembly at its fifty-sixth session and to assure him of namibias cooperation during his tenure. i would also like to congratulate his predecessor, his excellency mr. harri holkeri, for the skills he brought to the work of the general assembly while presiding over the fifty- fifth session. under his able leadership, we have made a firm beginning to the implementation of the declaration of the millennium summit. our secretary-general, mr. kofi annan, and the united nations have earned a place among the nobel peace prize laureates. for this, as well as for his unanimous, early re-election, namibia extends warm congratulations to the secretary-general. this, indeed, is eloquent testimony to the universal respect and admiration he has earned from all member states. we wish him well and assure him of our full support during his new term of office. 29 today we face multiple challenges, some of which threaten the future existence of communities and nations. with the adoption of the historic millennium declaration, world leaders pledged their determination to address old as well as new obstacles hampering peace and security. a solemn commitment has thus been made to enhance social and economic prosperity for all people, thereby ensuring a better world. through the united nations, and with strong political will, no challenge is insurmountable. the united nations is the only international body capable of serving the interests of all nations. it is an effective consultative and organizational forum for world affairs, and it can create trust and confidence among nations. it can bring peace to war-torn areas and bring relief and development to people who need it most. when sufficiently funded, its programmes and mandates can help developing countries to meet the challenges of hiv/aids, malaria and other diseases threatening our populations. it is therefore important that we, the member states, reaffirm our commitment to continue to strengthen our organization in order to effectively address the challenges of the new millennium. in this context, we reiterate our call for the reform and democratization of the security council. the security council must be transparent and equitably representative. above all, it must be responsive and accountable to all states members, on whose behalf it maintains international peace and security. the outcome of the historic first conference on illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects, held in july 2001, marked an important first step and set achievable goals to address the problems associated with this scourge, at all levels. it will now require the combined efforts of the united nations, member states and relevant international and regional organizations to ensure that rapid progress is made to stop the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, which has wreaked havoc, especially on the african continent. terrorism has assumed an increasingly alarming globalized character. for some time now, the movement of the non-aligned countries has been calling for an international conference against terrorism. the time is now right for member states to reach a consensus on such a conference. in this respect, i wish to point out that namibia signed, on 10 november 2001, the international convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism, and we call on others to do likewise. at the 1990 world summit for children we made a collective commitment to put children first, take care of and educate them and protect them from harm, exploitation, war and abuse. yet too many children in too many parts of the world are still deprived of a peaceful childhood. let us seize the occasion of the twenty-seventh special session of the general assembly, on children, to take effective measures to make the world fit for all our children. the hiv/aids pandemic has reached catastrophic proportions. the secretary-general reminded us that nearly 22 million people have died of hiv/aids and that out of more than 36 million people infected worldwide by hiv/aids, 25.3 million live in sub-saharan africa. thus, if indeed we are to succeed in reversing the spread of hiv/aids by 2015, as world leaders committed themselves to doing in so many forums, then governments, civil society and the private sector must, in strong partnership, tackle hiv/aids. in this connection, the establishment of the global aids and health fund to combat the aids epidemic and other communicable diseases is a welcome initiative which calls for generous contributions. the world conference against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, held in durban, south africa, was the beginning of a process undertaken by the international community to address the inhuman and brutal treatment of the victims of the dehumanizing practice of slavery and colonialism, especially the african people. the trans- atlantic slave trade and the colonization of the african peoples remain the darkest and most humiliating episode in the history of the african continent. the healing process will be enhanced only if and when those who committed and benefited from slavery and colonialism accept their full responsibility. namibia applauds the establishment of the international criminal court (icc), designed to bring to justice those individuals accused of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community. recently, the southern african development community (sadc) adopted the windhoek plan of action on icc ratification and implementation, designed to promote early ratification of the icc treaty. 30 namibia is currently reviewing its national legislation to prepare for the ratification of the treaty. the knowledge-based global economy has revolutionized the nature of trade, finance, employment, migration, the environment and social systems, as well as the concept and application of governance. namibia, like other countries of the south, expects tangible results from the international conference on financing for development, to be held next year in mexico. it is in the interest of north-south and south-south cooperation that additional options be explored to mobilize financing for development. similarly, the fourth ministerial meeting of the world trade organization, in doha, qatar, could pave the way to an equitable international trading system that is mutually beneficial to all countries, provided that political will prevails. the world summit on sustainable development, to be held in johannesburg, south africa, next year should galvanize momentum for the full implementation of agenda 21, in particular the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. desertification, land erosion and land degradation should be given due and appropriate consideration. africa has recently taken an important step towards greater unity and cohesion with the transformation of the organization of african unity into the african union. this momentous step would bring about closer integration of the continent and would make africa more competitive in an increasingly global market. furthermore, the heads of state and government adopted the new african initiative, now the new partnership for africas development, whose primary objective is the eradication of poverty through sustained economic growth and sustainable development. we call on the international community to support and assist african countries in the implementation of this new partnership. let me stress that the initiatives undertaken by japan, the peoples republic of china, the united states, under the third tokyo international conference on african development, the china-africa forum and the african growth and opportunity act respectively can complement the efforts of african countries for sustained economic growth. we congratulate the people of east timor on their struggle for independence and on conducting successful elections for their first constituent assembly. we commend the united nations for its important role in east timor. we wish the people of east timor every success in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of their country. we call on the international community to be generous in its support of the east timorese people in this most challenging phase of their nationhood. the eleventh of november this year marks 26 years of the independence of the republic of angola. but for more than a quarter of a century, the people of angola have endured a brutal and devastating war. they have suffered horrendous terrorist attacks against civilian targets, including most recently attacks on a passenger train, on school buses, the kidnapping of schoolchildren, attacks on hospitals and the wanton destruction of infrastructure; all at the hands of unita. tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children have been killed. their agricultural fields are infested with landmines. angola has acquired the dubious distinction of having the largest number of amputees and the greatest number of landmines. this is not right; it cannot be right. these heinous atrocities committed by unita, as well as that groups consistent record of duplicity and always negotiating in bad faith, compelled sadc, in 1998, to declare savimbi, unitas leader, a war criminal. for its part, having determined convincingly that unita is responsible for the violations of the lusaka protocol and the resumption of the war, the united nations security council imposed sanctions against unita. while sanctions have been effective in many important respects, more concrete measures need to be taken by member states to strengthen them and make them even more effective. african countries have a bigger and special obligation in this regard. sanctions must be tightened in those areas identified by the monitoring mechanism on sanctions against unita, such as the freezing of unita assets and bank accounts and the closing down of unita representations abroad, which now operate under misleading and innocuous sounding appellations but which in fact continue to promote unita activities and advocate its wicked cause. the international community should respond more decisively to repeated defiance of security council resolutions by unita. by acting more resolutely against unita, the 31 international community will help end the prolonged suffering, tears and agony of the people of angola. regarding the democratic republic of the congo, namibia is encouraged by the progress made in the implementation of the lusaka ceasefire agreement. the ceasefire has been holding so far despite some violations and infringements, particularly in the eastern part of the country. the continued occupation by forces of aggression has created deplorable human suffering and large-scale human rights violations in the democratic republic of the congo. namibia, once again wishes to remind the members of the united nations that a cardinal principle of the charter of this organization has been violated with impunity, when some of its members committed an act of naked aggression against the democratic republic of the congo. it is even more deplorable when the aggressor countries are engaged in the ruthless exploitation and plundering of the natural resources of the congo. we reiterate here that aggression should be rejected and condemned whenever and wherever it occurs. there should be no double standards when it comes to the violation of the principles of the charter with regard to aggression. the international community should also assist the people of the congo in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of their country. now it is time for the security council to implement its decisions without further delay and approve the personnel for phase iii of the deployment of the united nations organization mission in the democratic republic of the congo (monuc), taking fully into account the demands and requirements of that peacekeeping operation the size of the country and the non-existence of the infrastructure. the united nations and the international community cannot fail the people of the congo this time around. we are gratified by the increased efforts of the security council and the serious attention paid by the international community to sierra leone, which have now started to pay off. the international community should remain actively engaged and continue to assist with the peace-building and reconstruction of the peace-loving people of sierra leone. history teaches us that no administrative power has relinquished authority as a gesture of good will, that no peace process has been problem-free and that parties to a conflict, naturally, will have differences. this notwithstanding, however, no amount of difficulties can justify abandonment of the united nations settlement plan for western sahara. any attempt to legitimize, in whatever form or shape, the present situation in western sahara is unjustifiable and is a departure from the united nations declaration on decolonization and relevant general assembly and security council resolutions. ignoring the legitimate aspirations of the brave sahrawi people will only delay durable peace in the region. a departure from the united nations settlement plan will deny the sahrawi people their inalienable right to self-determination and independence. namibia will reject and will dissociate itself from any plan, informal or otherwise, to deny the sahrawi people their legitimate right to express themselves through a free, fair and impartial referendum for self-determination. no people can maintain peace and security or build its prosperity on the helplessness and abject misery of others, particularly their neighbours. the people of palestine and, indeed, the international community are crying out for the establishment of the palestinian state. they are crying out for peace between palestine and the state of israel. it is now time to heed this call. the legitimate right of the people of palestine to self-determination and the establishment of an independent state of their own cannot be denied and cannot be compromised. a palestinian state will be in the best interests of israel, of security and peace, of the entire middle east and of the whole world. the basis for a just and lasting peace in the middle east remains security council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). let us make sustained and determined collective efforts to promote peace and development in all corners of the world, so that our children and grandchildren can live in a peaceful world.",Namibia,Africa,84.9442596435547,6.888869762420654,2419.0,12.0,0.0,12.0,4.9607275733774285
NER,56,2001,"the fact that we are meeting under the presidency of one of the most eminent personalities of the republic of korea bears eloquent testimony to the positive changes in international relations and to the end of the ideological bipolarization of the world. i would like at the outset to convey the condolences of the republic of the niger to the united states of america and the dominican republic for the tragedy that occurred this morning. the niger would like to warmly congratulate mr. han seung-soo on his election as president of the general assembly at its fifty-sixth session, as well as the other members of the bureau. we are sure that he will demonstrate the same dynamism, energy and human qualities as his predecessor, mr. harri holkeri of finland, as he continues his outstanding work for the benefit of humankind. i would like to reaffirm the warm congratulations of the niger to our brother, mr. kofi annan, the secretary-general, for his re-election to a post whose visibility, prestige and effectiveness he has done so much to enhance, as well as for the award of the 2001 nobel peace prize, which is a testimony if further evidence were needed to the global recognition of the work that he has already accomplished in the service of humanity. this serves as an eloquent rebuttal to the arguments of all those who claim to find, in the denial of the fundamental principles of dialogue between cultures and nations principles enshrined in the charter the high road to salvation. in this regard, the niger endorses the relevant general assembly and security council resolutions, and welcomes the emergence of a general consensus on the need to wage war against terrorism on a collective and global basis, within the framework of the international legality embodied by the united nations. if we are to succeed, the fight against terrorism must be based on a programme of international cooperation, including, in particular, substantial financial and technical assistance to the most disadvantaged states so as to enable them to make a significant contribution to that process. still on the subject of peace and security, i would like to point out that, within the realm of disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, we are in the final stages of the process of ratifying the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty and of signing a safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency. with regard to conventional weapons, the convening of the united nations conference on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects fulfilled one of the commitments undertaken by our heads of state or government in the historic millennium declaration. the niger welcomes the fact that the conference was able to adopt, by consensus, a programme of action to combat that scourge, which is one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. furthermore, the niger welcomes the fact that that programme of action took account of the principal concerns expressed by african states in the bamako declaration, by providing, in particular, financial and technical assistance measures for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants. no part of the world has been spared the illicit trafficking in and circulation of small arms. but the developing countries, in particular those on the continent of africa, are paying the highest price for the proliferation of small arms from the standpoint of their security, stability and development. that is why the economic community of west african states moratorium on the manufacture, import and export of small arms, adopted in abuja in october 1998, which was extended for three years on 5 july, as well as the programme for coordination and assistance for security and development, should receive substantial financial support from the international community. 36 in this context, the niger reaffirms its support for the proposal of the united kingdom to create an international fund, to be managed by the united nations development programme, for the collection of small arms. if it is effective, that fund will help to support regional and national projects for the collection and destruction of small arms in exchange for development projects. in this regard, i am pleased to reaffirm to the assembly the gratitude of the niger to the countries that participated in the work of the group of interested states on practical disarmament measures. since the events of 11 september, the entire world has been assessing the tragic consequences of that manichaean ideology. terrorists are, without doubt, a threat to international peace and security. it has been claimed that those events were committed in the name of islam. but as everyone knows, islam is the religion of the golden mean, and condemns suicide and murder. it advocates dialogue and persuasion and the steadfast combating of any tendency towards individual or collective nihilism. that is one of the reasons why the niger fully associates itself with the global coalition against terrorism. that is also why, during the recent discussions on measures to eliminate international terrorism, the niger reiterated its firm condemnation of all forms of violence and its determination to commit itself to all subregional and international initiatives aimed at eradicating that scourge. in the millennium declaration, world leaders undertook to enhance the effectiveness of the united nations in the maintenance of international peace and security by providing it with the necessary tools and resources to better prevent conflict, bring about the peaceful settlement of disputes and consolidate peace and post-conflict reconstruction. in order to be effective, a preventive conflict-management strategy, as set out in the report of the secretary-general, requires the international community, working together with national and regional actors, to adopt a comprehensive approach encompassing political, diplomatic, humanitarian and institutional measures, and to undertake actions aimed at economic revitalization. as a follow-up to that report, last july in agadez my country, acting within the national dynamic aimed at consolidating peace and with the support of the united nations, organized a forum on conflict prevention the first of its kind in africa. that forum recommended the elaboration of a national conflict- prevention strategy, the implementation of which would be coordinated by the national commission for social dialogue, which brings together representatives of the state and civil society. for too long, the international communitys attention has been focused on the middle east, where repeated efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement of the israeli-arab conflict have ended in deadlock. the support of the g-8 for the idea of sending international observers to palestinian territory is an important step forward; such action would guarantee the impartial application of the recommendations of the mitchell report. the niger would like to reaffirm, here in the assembly, that a lasting settlement of the israeli- palestinian conflict cannot be achieved without the realization by the palestinian people of their inalienable right to an independent sovereign state. the niger wholeheartedly supports the position of the united states of america in this regard. with regard to the conflict in western sahara, the niger supports the efforts of the united nations, in particular those of the secretary-general and his personal envoy, to bring about a final settlement that is acceptable to interested and concerned parties. with regard to asia, the summit meeting that took place last july in india between the president of pakistan and the prime minister of india raised great hopes for a political settlement of the conflict in kashmir. such initiatives must be supported and encouraged so as to allow for the self-determination of the kashmiri people as soon as possible in accordance with the relevant security council resolutions. by according highest priority to the specific needs of africa, the millennium summit recognized the full magnitude of the serious problems that beset our continent. proof of this is that most african states are included on the list of least advanced and poorest countries and have been left behind by the technological revolution. the ravages caused by armed conflicts and the hiv/aids pandemic have affected more than 26 million africans and wiped out the hard- won progress made over the past decade. at the same time, the flow of official development assistance to africa has plummeted, while foreign direct investments have continued to stagnate. worse yet, between 1999 and 2000 those investments even fell from $10.5 37 billion to $9.1 billion, while during the same period they rose in asia and central and eastern europe. it is therefore urgent to increase the volume of official development assistance, to expand debt- cancellation initiatives, to improve the access of african exports to international markets and to promote investment. these measures must be accompanied by appropriate support for the efforts of the united nations system because this organization is the best forum for promoting new partnerships for the benefit of africa. in this respect, the niger very much hopes that africas drive to reappropriate its own development will be encouraged. that drive is marked by the proliferation of national and regional initiatives, the most recent manifestation of which was the adoption at the lusaka summit of the organization of african unity (oau) of an african development plan, the implementation of which the g-8 has decided to support. the forthcoming international conference on financing for development should prove to be a decisive turning point in the establishment of a more just and equitable world economic order. it should, inter alia, lead to the adoption of a clear political declaration defining strategic priorities, accompanied by a precise timetable, with respect to the strengthening of the capacities of the developing countries, particularly the least developed among them, and their integration into the world economy. the conference should be the point of departure of a broad world partnership to channel all energies towards the mobilization of resources for development and the reform of international financial structures. in this regard, the 10-year brussels programme of action for the least developed countries has made it possible to lay the foundations of an enhanced world partnership to achieve the economic growth essential to reducing poverty. following the firm commitments undertaken in brussels, there are now grounds for hope that, particularly with regard to trade, the current round of world trade organization negotiations in qatar will take fully into account the interests of the least developed countries, whose 630 million inhabitants have a legitimate aspiration to benefit from the positive effects of globalization. in the absence of an appropriate response from the affluent countries, the damage caused by the hiv/aids epidemic may prove to be irreparable, given that some specialists estimate that there will be 100 million dead from that disease by the year 2010 if effective measures are not taken immediately to stem the scourge. need we recall, moreover, that malaria claims as many human victims in africa as aids, particularly in west africa? it is comforting to note, however, that the international community has finally become aware of the signal danger posed by that disease. the niger welcomes the decision of the united nations to proclaim the period 2001-2010 the decade to roll back malaria in developing countries, particularly in africa. the united nations is thus in step with the various initiatives of the oau in the struggle against malaria, led by yahya jammeh of gambia, olusegun obasanjo of nigeria and mamadou tandja of the niger. there can be no doubt that the struggle against major diseases calls for substantial resources and a strong capacity for coordinated action. the niger therefore welcomes the secretary-generals establishment of the global aids and health fund, which should give a new dynamic to the struggle against aids, malaria and tuberculosis, which together claim 5 million dead throughout the world every year. the announcement made at the g-8 summit in genoa that $1.8 billion will be devoted to launching the global fund is an important step in the right direction. in spite of everything, a great deal remains to be done. according to united nations estimates, approximately $3 billion must be mobilized before 2001 for aids alone and contributions of $7 billion to $10 billion will be necessary every year thereafter until 2005. thus, today more than ever, the international community must demonstrate active solidarity between rich and poor and a sense of unshakeable collective responsibility in a word, unfailing political will if it wishes to translate into deeds the declaration of commitment adopted at the special session on hiv/aids. the progress achieved in the niger in its current reform programme has allowed us to re-establish and consolidate the countrys economic bases, to revive fruitful relations with the international financial institutions and thus to secure the nigers eligibility for the heavily indebted poor countries debt initiative. furthermore, the niger recently established a new framework for the implementation of its own national 38 anti-poverty policy. a strategy for reducing poverty defines the countrys priorities and measures and actions to be undertaken in order to achieve the targets set in various spheres, which will allow us to make serious inroads into poverty by 2015. this struggle against poverty in the niger enjoys the highest political involvement. a programme initiated personally by the president of the republic, mr. mamadou tandja, is designed to improve the living standards of the people of our country. the first phase of what is known as the programme of the president of the republic has already led to the construction of 1,000 wells, 100 mini-dams, 100 schools and 100 health centres for rural communities. it is well known that such communities in the niger suffer intractable illiteracy, a serious lack of infrastructure and cyclical food shortages caused by irregular rainfall. the programme also stresses the link between poverty and the environment. it is in that context that we plan to plant 1 million trees throughout our national territory by the end of this year. the government is thus perfectly in step with the deep-rooted aspirations of the people of the niger, who recognize in its actions their ancestral lore of personal and collective effort against adversity, and with its bilateral and multilateral partners, whose ongoing concern is the restoration of the environment. all the institutions of the united nations family and the european union in particular france, germany, italy and great britain as well as canada and japan, have contributed significantly to reviving the ecological system and to combating desertification in the niger. in the niger, we are fully aware that this fight is primary a national one. we wage it through volunteerism, the roots of which are deeply entrenched in our traditions and extend beyond our frontiers. i take this opportunity to reiterate the profound gratitude of the niger to all the bodies of the united nations system, in particular the united nations development programme, the united nations population fund, the united nations childrens fund and our other development partners, for their precious support for the efforts of the government to promote the well-being of our people. to conclude, i would say that the international community needs a strong united nations to achieve the ambitious objectives set forth in the charter and to implement the millennium declaration. it is therefore necessary to give unstinting support to the secretary- general in his efforts to reform the organization, strengthen its role and secure the resources that will allow him to accomplish his task effectively. the united nations remains indeed the only institution capable of bringing about the new world order to which we all so deeply aspire.",Niger,Africa,14.3760404586792,2.279819965362549,2566.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,1.9485580670303975
SEN,57,2002,"my delegation is particularly pleased to convey to mr. jan kavan its heartfelt congratulations and fervent hopes for success in the lofty and important task ahead of him. his well-deserved election to the presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the general assembly is a fitting tribute to the spirit of the czech people as well as to his outstanding intellectual and moral qualities. i am pleased to take this opportunity to say how much we appreciated the courtesy, the commitment and the competence of his predecessor, mr. han seung-soo, who guided our discussions in such an outstanding manner. we express to him our sincere and deep gratitude for his many relevant initiatives, including working visits to west africa, particularly to senegal, which are testimony of friendship for my country and support for the new partnership for africa's development (nepad). i should like also like to express once again to secretary-general kofi annan our admiration for his steadfast determination in serving the ideals and causes of our organization. thanks to his wisdom and far- sightedness, the united nations has found new vigour with which to meet the tremendous challenges confronting humankind. it is therefore fitting that our organization which more than ever needs the widest support for its plans and projects for a better management of the affairs of our globalized world is gaining two new members: switzerland and, soon, east timor. to the delegations of those two friendly countries, i would like to express senegal's warmest congratulations and our conviction that their contribution will undoubtedly be enriching for our organization, whose universal character will thereby be reinforced. it is precisely in the name of the principle of the universality of the united nations that senegal reiterates its fervent wish to see the republic of china on taiwan join the concert of nations and assume its full responsibilities in our organization and its specialized agencies. granting that request, following the good precedent of the world trade organization, would bring justice to the 23 million inhabitants of the republic of china on taiwan, who through their exemplary conduct on the world stage have already given proof of taipei's attachment to the noble objectives of the san francisco charter. last week, the united nations and the international community commemorated the anniversary of the tragic events of 11 september 2001. we express once again our sincere sentiments of sympathy and compassion to the thousands of american and other families in mourning. senegal, its head of state and its government strongly reiterate their steadfast determination to fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, whatever its motivations and whoever its perpetrators and sponsors. senegal proclaims loudly and clearly that there is no reason or cause sufficiently just or sufficiently good that it could justify an act of terrorism against pregnant women and other innocent civilians. 23 the dakar declaration against terrorism, adopted on 17 october 2001 at the initiative of president abdoulaye wade of senegal, gives full expression to our fervent wish to strengthen regional and subregional cooperation in order to dismantle the menace of terrorist activities on our continent. let us remember the heinous and unrepentant terrorist strikes against the african people in kenya and tanzania. nor do we forget the heroic daily resistance of the algerian people in the face of repeated assaults by killers blinded by their hatred and not by their faith in god, at least not in the god of love and compassion that we muslims proudly call allah. to that end, senegal submitted some months ago to the african union a draft additional protocol to the convention on the prevention and combating of terrorism of the organization of african unity and the african union. the draft protocol aims to strengthen the algiers convention and to adapt it to the post-11- september context. also, my delegation welcomes the fine initiative of the commission of the african union, which recently held in algiers a high-level intergovernmental meeting on terrorism in africa. in other words, we have the common responsibility to maintain and to strengthen the international mobilization against terrorist networks and their financing. my government welcomes the excellent work already carried out by the security council counter- terrorism committee pursuant to security council resolution 1373 (2001). senegal encourages the committee to pursue its efforts and requests the working group of the general assembly's sixth committee to do everything to hasten the adoption of a comprehensive international convention against terrorism. it is a truism that the fight against terrorism is a part of the international community's struggle to promote international peace and security. that is the objective that over the past months has not escaped our organization, which has strived to find lasting solutions to conflicts that destroy the social and economic fabric of numerous countries, especially in africa. in that regard, senegal keenly appreciates the determined commitment of the security council, which, more conscious than ever of its role of guarantor of international peace and security, has devoted a large portion of its work this year to conflicts and tensions afflicting the african continent. among the numerous praiseworthy initiatives of the security council, i would like to mention the convening of special meetings devoted to the situation of africa, brilliantly presided over by the ministers for foreign affairs of mauritius and singapore during their respective presidencies. on behalf of the economic community of west african states (ecowas), of which senegal currently holds the chairmanship, i would like to nurture the hope that the united nations will stay the course in order to forever stave off violence and wars, which take a serious financial toll on the future of many african countries. i am thinking of sierra leone, where the current exemplary normalization of the political and economic situation has largely been facilitated by the holding of free, transparent, democratic and peaceful elections. it is urgent that the bells of peace, which have sounded in freetown, also be heard in monrovia, where the absence of political dialogue led the way to grave socio-economic instability, whose contagious effect could turn out to be disastrous for the mano river union area. senegal, as chairman of ecowas, is working tirelessly and hopes to be able to report to the assembly on its many initiatives under way, which could very shortly lay the foundations of peace in liberia. in sierra leone and liberia, as in guinea-bissau, where the government of president kumba yal is attempting with courage and abnegation to lift the country out of a financial and economic crisis following a trying civil war, the international community has the duty to continue more steadfastly its valuable assistance. in that regard, i welcome the strong signal sent by the security council under the united states presidency to financial backers with respect to granting guinea-bissau substantial financial aid so that it can firmly return to the path of peace and prosperity. the interest in that neighbour of senegal and in our subregion recalls the wise and timely decision to establish at dakar an office of the special representative of the secretary-general for west africa. that office should promote better coordination among the activities of the united nations in our subregion and their greater impact on the ground. i am 24 pleased to sincerely congratulate secretary-general kofi annan on that clear-sighted initiative. it goes without saying that the office will enjoy the enthusiastic support and complete cooperation of the government of senegal. allow me to recall the activities of president abdoulaye wade in benefit of the great african people of madagascar. his personal and total involvement in mediating a solution to the madagascar crisis has, as a great international statesman said, surely spared the people of that great island a drift towards a civil war of incalculable consequences. he and his african colleagues who have taken up that issue have shown the world that with the strong support of the international community africans will prove that they are also and above all peacemakers. elsewhere, beyond the african continent but so close to our hearts, we observe a growing danger in the middle east. this year again, the world has witnessed unheard-of violence in the palestinian territories, where the occupying military power, israel, has decidedly opted for state violence, which leads to concepts as dangerous as the so-called targeted assassinations and other preventive operations. on the palestinian side, that situation has caused an increase in terrorist cells specialists in suicide belts groups that we unequivocally and resolutely condemn. that network has produced an erosion of trust between israelis and palestinians trust that must be restored as swiftly as possible through frank and constructive dialogue that leads to a just and lasting solution. in order to achieve that, it is imperative that tel aviv comply with the relevant security council resolutions in particular resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 1397 (2002) and that it also adhere to the peace plan proposed by saudi arabia and to the initiatives of the quartet, which set out the basic principles of land for peace and withdrawal for normalization. the international community, in particular the security council and the quartet, has the critical duty to formulate a bold plan to realize the vision of two states within the 1967 borders and to hasten what senegal has continued to call for in all international forums: the immediate convening of an international conference on palestine, leading to a specific mechanism that would address political, economic and security issues and having as its starting point the creation of a sovereign palestinian state side by side an israeli state, living in peace and harmony with its neighbours. over the past 12 months, the international scene has been dominated by the holding of three major conferences that were crucial events in humanity's collective march towards a more just and more unified world: the fourth ministerial conference of the world trade organization, held at doha, qatar; the international conference on financing for development, held at monterrey, mexico; and the world summit on sustainable development, held at johannesburg, south africa. those world conferences and the strong alliances that they created will allow humanity to enter the third millennium on a positive note. i should like to note here that, in the light of those statements of good intentions, the time for action has come. we must act swiftly so that globalization, a phenomenon that affects us all, will ultimately benefit us all. up to now, despite its certain virtues, globalization seems to have caused greater marginalization of the vast majority of the peoples of the south. as a consequence, it is urgent that we identify innovative mechanisms of development financing. in fact, even if official development assistance is still valuable for the states of the south, its effectiveness will be limited without the addition of concrete measures such as access for products of the south to markets of the north, an increase in foreign direct investment flows to developing countries, particularly those in africa, and the initiating role that, we must recognize, belongs to the international and african private sectors. indeed, senegal is convinced that no country in the world has ever developed through official development assistance. the private sector, infrastructure and education are universally acknowledged as the tripod of genuine sustainable development. it is no less urgent, following the much- appreciated appointment of a high representative of the secretary-general for the least developed countries, that we all commit ourselves to implementing the brussels programme of action, in conformity with the consensus of the 12th ministerial meeting of the group of 49, held at cotonou from 5 to 7 august 2002. the success of such initiatives cannot depend on governments alone. we need to build firm partnerships with local communities, with civil society actors, with 25 the private sector, with non-governmental organizations and with international organizations. it is fitting that humanity's oldest continent should be proud of the adoption of the new partnership for africa's development (nepad), a double partnership internal and international and a linkage, on the one hand, among africans and, on the other, between africa and the rest of the international community, which has already shown its full support for that new initiative. as evidence, i cite the group of eight africa action plan and the holding of the high-level plenary meeting of the general assembly to consider how to support nepad. through nepad, which has the merit of defining the prerequisites for african development, of identifying sectoral priorities and of developing a resource mobilization strategy, african leaders among them his excellency mr. abdoulaye wade, president of the republic of senegal intend to demonstrate that the responsibility for africa's development is essentially theirs. in that context, i must mention the launching of the african union in july at durban, south africa. we hope that its peace and security council, coupled with nepad's peer review mechanism, will lead to strong commitments by our heads of state, first for our people and then for our partners, which are very concerned by the central questions of good governance and conflict prevention and resolution. our development concerns do not preclude our demands for human rights. that is why my country attaches great importance to the promotion and protection of the rights of women and children. at the initiative of the government, a major programme is under way to combat, in particular, violence against women and the trafficking and exploitation of women and children for commercial and sexual purposes. in those areas, the strategy formulated and implemented by senegal is based on action plans adopted at the special session of the general assembly on beijing +5 and on the follow-up to the world summit on children. as is its custom, senegal wishes to honour and praise the great role of women in the world, in particular their african sisters, as the foundation and the powerful engine of african renewal. history will take note that it is senegal that, through its president, has demanded and ensured that each of the five subregions of africa elect at least one woman in its quota of two commissioners to the commission of the african union. africa is thus teaching the rest of the world a lesson in unprecedented parity, which is more proof if it were needed that, if we seek competent women, we will find them. at the initiative of its president, senegal will organize, on 10 october at dakar, a special summit of heads of state or government of ecowas to follow up the results of the twenty-sixth special session of the general assembly, devoted to children. the rights of women and children are integral elements of human rights, and my country reaffirms its attachment to the principles of the universality, interdependence and indivisibility of human rights, of good economic and political governance and of the rule of law. it is that democratic imperative that has prompted the head of state of senegal to strengthen our institutional arsenal by creating the position of commissioner of human rights, to which a woman has been appointed. as members are aware, senegal was the first country in the world to ratify the rome statute for the establishment of the international criminal court (icc), whose entry into force on 1 july 2002 my country welcomed. that commitment resulted in my government's decision to present a candidate for judge on the icc one of our finest magistrates and a specialist in criminal law. in conclusion, i should like, in recalling the urgency of confronting humanity's numerous challenges, to express the earnest hope that the organization will bolster its ability to better serve the legitimate hopes of the world's peoples. undoubtedly, that path will anchor the future of a world reconciled with itself, where justice, freedom, peace and prosperity will be jealously preserved in justice and freedom, in peace and prosperity, and in the dignity of human beings all human beings.",Senegal,Africa,39.2752494812012,2.594419956207275,2641.0,11.0,0.0,11.0,4.165088981446422
BEN,57,2002,"on behalf of the delegation of the republic of benin, allow me to convey to mr. jan kavan our heartfelt congratulations on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the general assembly. his skills, his extensive experience in international affairs and his dedication to the lofty causes championed by the united nations guarantee the success of our work. i wish to assure him of my delegation's full cooperation and support in ensuring the full success of the work of this session. i should like to take this opportunity also to congratulate and to thank his predecessor, mr. han seung-soo of the republic of korea, who presided so ably and with such dedication over the work of the fifty-sixth session of the assembly. i wish also to pay tribute to our secretary- general, kofi annan, whose devotion and skills have enhanced the prestige of our organization. the message that i bring the assembly from benin is a message of peace, which our people are experiencing, and a message of the preservation of peace in all its aspects, in keeping with the charter of our organization and with the millennium declaration, in which we pledged to build for future generations a world free from fear, hunger and ignorance. 24 the barbaric acts perpetrated a year ago, on 11 september 2001 here in new york and in other places, are still vivid in our memory, making ever more urgent the need to make greater strides in our common endeavour of civilization. the sincere and spontaneous compassion and sympathy of the peoples of the world for the victims of the terrible attacks of 11 september prove that more than ever before we are bound by a common destiny. it is therefore vital to give real meaning to this solidarity and this shared responsibility. the united nations must continue to play a dynamic role in the promotion of international cooperation in order to prevent and punish acts of terrorism. for benin, nothing no pretext whatsoever could justify such barbaric acts, and the terrifying images that i am loath to recall today will remain etched in our collective memory throughout the twenty-first century. benin's firm commitment to combating terrorism is unambiguous, and we intend to fight this scourge with resolve. thus, pursuant to security council resolution 1373 (2001), adopted on 28 september 2001, benin submitted a report on the measures we have taken to prevent and punish acts of terrorism. a constructive and effective dialogue is under way with the security council committee regarding proposed measures to prevent and suppress the financing of acts of terrorism. however, the anti-terrorist campaign will be more effective and more comprehensive if it is organized on the basis of strict respect for the purposes and principles of the united nations. we believe that there is an urgent need for a clear, precise, legal definition of international terrorism in order to prevent the haphazard character of our individual or collective initiatives from jeopardizing the effectiveness of the global coalition against the terrorist threat. by placing africa at the centre of its concerns for the new millennium, the united nations has rightly focused the attention of the international community on that continent, which, despite its commendable efforts, is having difficulty finding its way towards development. the persistence of war and conflict, which repeatedly lead to great bloodshed in that part of the world, is one of the main reasons for that situation. aware that, as it faces new challenges, our continent is at a critical stage in its development and that it is for africa to shoulder its own responsibilities, african leaders have taken a number of political initiatives aimed at resolving conflict, rising to the great challenge of endowing africa with new forums for dialogue and action. this african renaissance, by means of which africa is determined to take control of its own destiny and find solutions to its ills, should be encouraged through support for the african union, which was launched in durban, south africa, in july this year. the african union espouses the vision of the founding fathers of the african nations and of the former organization of african unity. the african union is different from the organization of african unity because it stresses the need for the economic integration of the continent and affirms that peace, security and stability are indispensable conditions for the creation of an environment conducive to development and that good governance must be the norm for our states. i wish to reaffirm what many earlier speakers have said: africa is beginning to play its proper role. it looks forward to a concrete demonstration of the goodwill so often expressed by the international community. it looks forward to real action in the form of deeds. we expect this for the new partnership for africa's development (nepad), for example. under the wise guidance of the president of the general assembly, we spent an entire day debating that african union programme. relevant remarks were uttered, commitments undertaken and forceful statements made from this very rostrum, and i do not need to dwell further on that subject. now is the time for action, and time is of the essence. globalization must become synonymous with a better life for all the peoples of the world. the world cannot just stand by and watch the spectacle of an africa that has been marginalized and ravaged by wars and disease. africa must not be an object of condescension, as if the world did not have sufficient resources to avert catastrophe. i am sure that our collective awareness is real and sincere. that is why i welcome the timely initiative of the security council to establish an ad hoc working group on conflict prevention and resolution in africa. we hope that that initiative will demonstrate a genuine, ongoing commitment on the part of the security council to act to put an end to the cycle of violence in africa, thereby according equal treatment to all humanitarian crises without exception. 25 in the context of collective efforts to consider and deal with the question of conflict prevention and resolution through a comprehensive, integrated approach that takes into account political, economic and social dimensions, my delegation recommends reinforced interaction between the security council and the economic and social council, in particular by developing close consultations with the ad hoc advisory group of the economic and social council on african countries emerging from conflict. one of the most encouraging signs for africa in recent years indeed in recent months is the firm determination finally to put an end to fratricidal warfare. we must support such efforts everywhere, including in sierra leone, angola, congo, eritrea and ethiopia. i want to comment in particular on sierra leone, which has successfully emerged from a risky and dangerous electoral process. i would like to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the united nations and to the countries which, at the bilateral level, have been helping sierra leone to reintegrate itself into the community of nations. i hope that the positive evolution of the situation in that country will have a ripple effect within the mano river union. i welcome the outstanding progress that has been made in the process towards the restoration of peace and security in the democratic republic of the congo. in that respect, i would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to president thabo mbeki and to the facilitator, sir ketumile masire, for their commitment and perseverance. we welcome the fact that the guns have now been silenced in angola after so many years of suffering, destruction and privation. it is crucial to strengthen and consolidate the peace process that is under way in that country. that is why i urgently appeal to the international community to provide support that is commensurate with the enormous reconstruction needs of angola. only thus will conditions be right for the establishment of lasting peace and sustainable development. i am pleased to note, among the initiatives to promote peace in africa, the success of negotiations on an agreement on the demarcation of the border between ethiopia and eritrea and the continuing dialogue to restore peace in burundi and the sudan. in january this year, 49 of the poorest countries of the world chose my country, benin, to hold the chairmanship of the coordinating office for the least developed countries. when we accepted that prestigious post, my government was well aware of the heavy responsibilities that we were assuming. the most important item on mankind's agenda today is sustainable development. any progress or any regression must be assessed by the group of countries that benin is now coordinating. the international community itself recognizes that many problems remain. the third united nations conference on the least developed countries noted with regret that previous goals had not been achieved, and it clearly identified the main obstacles to the development of the least developed countries. these include the continuing decrease in official development assistance, the debt burden, the difficulty of gaining access to the markets of the developed countries and the lack of foreign investment. by adopting a programme of action and a political declaration at brussels, the international community renewed its commitment to helping the least developed countries resolutely to deal with mechanisms whose operations increase poverty. mindful of the need to mobilize energy and increase capacity in order thoroughly to implement the brussels programme of action, the least developed countries took the initiative of meeting at cotonou, from 5 to 7 august 2002, in order to consider ways and means of ensuring the implementation of the programme. the cotonou conference formulated guidelines and made recommendations, contained in the important cotonou declaration. at the national level, the declaration recommends the establishment of an implementation and follow-up mechanism to monitor integration of the programme of action into national development programmes and to promote the creation of a national forum for dialogue. it also recommends that the least developed countries design their strategic development priorities in keeping with local contexts. that is an important factor for guaranteeing rationality and national ownership of policies. at the international level, united nations and other international agencies are called on to incorporate the programme of action into their work programmes and government processes. 26 i believe it important to call attention to the dangerous dwindling of resources available to the operational institutions of the united nations system particularly the united nations development programme, the united nations population fund, the united nations capital development fund, the united nations children's fund and the world health organization and to stress the crucial need to find ways and means of increasing those resources in order to strengthen these agencies' valuable efforts to combat poverty in our countries. the cotonou ministerial meeting also recommended the establishment of a synoptic table to be used by the economic and social council when it reviews and follows up the implementation of the programme of action by the least developed countries and their development partners. i wish at this point to reiterate our gratification and thanks to secretary-general kofi annan for the celerity with which he implemented the decision taken by the general assembly at its fifty-sixth session to establish the office of the high representative for the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states. the secretary-general nominated ambassador chowdhury of bangladesh to that important post, which he has already assumed. in nominating ambassador chowdhury, the secretary-general could not have made a more fortunate choice. we all know ambassador chowdhury and his great experience, resolve and dedication. his country, bangladesh, has served the group of least developed countries with distinction for 20 years. i salute that work today. the secretary-general and each one of us must now offer every assistance to ambassador chowdhury and his office in becoming fully operational and in carrying out his important mission of obtaining the resources necessary for action. to that end, it is important that every member of the united nations, even the poorest, make some effort, for example, by contributing to the trust fund to support the implementation of the brussels programme of action. the government of benin will assume all its responsibilities in that respect in due course. in johannesburg recently, at the world summit on sustainable development, the international community acknowledged its responsibility to the poor, the vulnerable and the marginalized as members of the great human family. it also recognized the need to conclude a world alliance for sustainable development, by which the developed countries would make the essential effort of solidarity with the poorest. a giant step forward was taken there, but action is now required. we fervently hope today that all the measures advocated in johannesburg will become a reality. if they do not, there will be no reduction, but an increase in poverty. we can stave off that danger, which is deadly for all of us.",Benin,Africa,34.6578483581543,2.15949010848999,2152.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,2.3234200743494426
ERI,57,2002,"let me start by congratulating the president on his unanimous election to preside over the fifty-seventh session of the united nations general assembly. his election is an honour to him and to his country, the czech republic. the delegation of the state of eritrea assures you of its full cooperation and support. allow me also to extend to his predecessor, mr. han seung-soo of the republic of korea, my delegation's deep appreciation for a job well done during the fifty-sixth session of the general assembly. profound appreciation is also due to our secretary- general, mr. kofi annan, for his tireless efforts to make our united nations more responsive and effective. on this happy occasion, my delegation welcomes the swiss confederation to the family of nations with great pleasure. we commend the decision taken by the swiss people in allowing their great country to become a full member of the united nations. the same words go to the soon-to-be 191st member of our organization, the democratic republic of east timor, a country whose sovereignty and independence has been won with sweat and blood, like that of my own country. warm welcome from eritrea, east timor! the fifty-seventh session of the general assembly is taking place at a time when the wounds and scars from the 11 september terrorist attack one year ago, in three locations over the soil of the united states, are still healing. grief, pain and anger are still lingering. at a gathering here at headquarters this 11 september to commemorate the first anniversary of the attack, secretary-general kofi annan said, on 11 september grief enveloped the world, not only out of solidarity with the people of the united states, but out of shared loss. more than 90 nations lost sons and daughters of their own murdered that day for no other reason than that they had chosen to live in this country. today, we come together as a world community because we were attacked as a world community. the loss of almost 3,000 innocent lives in a single day is so painful. the eritrean people share the pain and the grief. they reiterate their condolences to those who lost their loved ones, and they stand in solidarity with the american people at this trying time. indeed, the attacks of 11 september have inevitably changed the way we live and the way we see our world. this day has symbolized the alarm clock that rung around the world to wake us all. my delegation regrets that it took attacks of such magnitude to shake us from our unwatchful sleep. 22 terrorism is not a new phenomenon in my country. the state of eritrea has suffered it since its formal independence, in 1993, as the youngest country in africa. the eritrean islamic jihad movement and the so-called eritrean popular islamic conference were created and sponsored by al qaeda and other regional and international islamic groups to perpetrate subversive acts in eritrea for the last 10 years. in 1994, eritrean security forces intercepted a mixed group of terrorists that included in their ranks al qaeda-trained nationals from several countries. in 1995, this group murdered four belgian tourists inside eritrea in cold blood. sporadic cross-border acts of terror and subversion continue to this day. in a statement contained in document s/1997/517 of 7 july 1997, my government first warned the international community, and subsequently the then organization of african unity (oau) and the security council, that international terrorist threats from extreme fundamentalist islamic groups were on the way. the eritrean jihad terrorist movements, which are members of the al qaeda network, are now part of the so-called alliance of eritrean national forces. this umbrella organization has bases and physical presences in some neighbouring, and a number of western, countries. these groups continue to obtain sanctuary, as well as financial and other forms of assistance, from western capitals. as the fight against international terrorism assumes high priority and warrants concerted action, the government of eritrea requests full cooperation and joint action from the countries where these terrorist elements live, plan and launch their operations. at this juncture, i also wish to reiterate to the assembly that the people and government of eritrea will continue to fight terrorism in all its forms. despite the declaration by the 1999 algiers summit of the oau to make the year 2000 the year to end conflicts and to start a new momentum for peace in africa, conflicts have continued to take a heavy toll on african peoples in many countries of the continent. this is indeed disappointing. i come from the horn of africa, a subregion where conflicts and wars have been a way of life for many decades. the horn of africa is also a place that has seen many misfortunes. recurring conflicts over past decades have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, displaced a staggering number of people and forced millions out of their countries to live as refugees in foreign lands. the internal conflict in the sudan is now the longest running one in africa. under the framework of the inter-governmental authority on development (igad), a subregional entity, the state of eritrea, together with the other member countries, is doing its best to bring about a resolution to this conflict. we have come a long way in bringing the conflicting parties to face-to-face talks. there are encouraging signs, but we cannot congratulate ourselves yet. our efforts may be considered a success once quieter days of peace, stability and sustained prosperity prevail in that sisterly country. i must admit that we need the help of the international community to end the suffering of our brothers and sisters in the sudan. in the same vein, the problem in somalia, another sisterly country in the horn, continues to be a serious one that the international community cannot ignore. the vicious conflict in somalia will have long-term catastrophic humanitarian consequences if the international community abandons this unfortunate country. the united nations and the world community at large must help the transitional national government of somalia to stabilize peace and security in the country. the international community should rush to save somalia. now, on a positive note, let me tell the assembly the good news regarding the border conflict between my country and ethiopia. on 13 april this year, the eritrea-ethiopia boundary commission, a panel of five judges established by the algiers agreement, made a judicial ruling on the entire 1,000-kilometer border between the two countries. the people and government of eritrea are pleased to see a legal solution to a conflict they never chose. my government believed from the very beginning that this conflict could not be settled by might, but by peaceful means alone. the pacifist a. j. muste said it all: there is no way to peace. peace is the way. the boundary commission has drawn the new border and is currently in the process of physically demarcating the lines on the ground. completion of the demarcation is expected in the next few months. according to the algiers agreement, which both countries signed, the decision of the commission is 23 final and binding. eritrea has reiterated its acceptance of the commission's decision of 13 april 2002. eritrea therefore believes that territorial claims and counter- claims ended on that day. in legal terms, the conflict ended then too. now that the conflict has legally been put to rest, the people of eritrea want to leave this awful experience behind them and move on with life afresh. as carl bard said, though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending. what matters is the destination point. the people and government of eritrea are committed to turning things around. at the end of this saga, my delegation finds it fitting to pay tribute at the general assembly to our peace-loving friends and partners who helped us to get here. allow me therefore to particularly thank the former organization of african unity, now the african union; president abdelaziz bouteflika of algeria; the secretary-general of the united nations, mr. kofi annan; the government of the united states of america; and the european union. we are grateful to them all for their valued efforts in this difficult and long peace process. the year 2002 saw five important international gatherings aimed at bringing peace, security, human dignity and economic prosperity to the peoples of the world, big and small alike. those meetings included the international conference on financing for development in monterrey, the second world assembly on ageing in madrid, the special session on children in new york, the world food summit in rome and, lastly, the world summit on sustainable development in johannesburg. the promises and declarations of all these international events are tied in with the goals of the 2000 united nations millennium declaration. as we all know, those goals embrace the key dimensions of human development related to poverty, hunger, education and health stated as a set of time-bound targets. those targets are: halving poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education and gender equality, reducing under-5 mortality by two thirds and maternal mortality by three quarters, halting the spread of hiv/aids and halving the proportion of people who lack access to safe water. with 1990 as the base year, those targets are to be achieved by 2015. despite the promises of globalization and the many initiatives launched at various times to help the continent, africa's economic growth is still lagging far behind. the success of development in africa still depends on the political will of rich countries to provide financial assistance, on the one hand, and on the full ownership and effective execution of national development programmes by african countries themselves, on the other. having said that, i shall now, for the benefit of our partners, reiterate the five core principles underlying eritrea's development strategy: first, developing the capabilities of our people as the principal asset and driving force of our development endeavours; secondly, establishing strong public- private sector partnerships; thirdly, striving to achieve self-reliance and avoiding chronic and debilitating dependency; fourthly, protecting the environment from the adverse effects of development programmes; and fifthly, establishing effective development partnerships with multilateral and bilateral development agencies, with governments and with non-governmental organizations. i would be remiss if i failed to bring to the attention of the assembly the looming drought that threatens the lives of more than 1 million men, women and children in eritrea. the failure of vital rains expected in the months of april and may has put their lives at risk. famine is imminent if international aid does not reach the eritrean people soon. i wish to use this occasion, therefore, to appeal to the donor community to respond to this pressing humanitarian need. in conclusion, i wish to express my delegation's confidence that, under your able leadership, mr. president, the fifty-seventh session will see much success.",Eritrea,Africa,52.5139503479004,3.523900032043457,1822.0,12.0,0.0,12.0,6.586169045005488
MLI,58,2003,"first, sir, please accept my warm congratulations and my fervent hopes for your successful achievement of the mission entrusted to you. your election to the presidency of the fifty-eighth session of the general assembly is a fitting tribute by the international community to the people of saint lucia. i am convinced that with your experience 22 and your distinguished intellectual and ethical qualities, you will successfully lead our work to be carried out in the best spirit. sir, i wish to convey to your predecessor, mr. jan kavan, the congratulations of the delegation of mali for the skill, dedication and spirit of initiative and the authority with which he directed the work of the fifty- seventh session of the general assembly. i also take this solemn occasion to pay well-deserved tribute to secretary-general mr. kofi annan for his dedication to the ideals of the united nations. the present session is opening in a context where the united nations is still confronting challenges to its very existence; those challenges moved humanity 58 years ago to equip itself with an instrument of hope capable of meeting them. let us recall that the united nations were conceived to save ourselves from the demons of war and insecurity. the idea was to secure a state of grace one of man reconciled with himself and to create the conditions for reducing material want, uncertainty and poverty. flashpoints of tension fire and smoke exist and are developing in many places. poverty and distress are the daily lot of many inhabitants of our planet, particularly in africa. the arrival of the new millennium brought enormous hopes. we have barely turned to the third page of this millennium and new challenges are assailing humankind. upon us are other questions for which we must uncover the appropriate solutions so that our organization will remain true to itself and pursue its goals without succumbing to a hijacking of its mandate. the government of mali believes that the united nations remains an instrument of great value. defining the rules of the game is one thing; applying them under the watchful eye of an impartial arbiter who has the necessary authority and the corresponding means to act is another. we need to work to make the united nations that authority and arbiter. for its part, under the distinguished leadership of mr. amadou toumani toure, president of the republic of mali, our country is steadfastly committed to supporting the united nations in attaining its objective: the full development of humankind. at the national level, our president is firmly committed to strengthening the institutions of the republic and of communities, to promote democracy and human rights and to give a boost to good governance, economic growth and sustainable development. peace and security are among the principal values held and venerated by the peoples of the entire world as they are essential for their social and economic development. mali has been fully committed to the twin challenges of conflict prevention and conflict management. at the subregional level, mali has sent troops to liberia, and our president has been personally committed to solidarity with the government and people of cute d'ivoire in their search for coordinated political solutions to the crisis faced by that brotherly country. that testifies to the importance we attach to peace and stability. at the continental level, our country will unstintingly continue its tireless efforts within the african union, which have deployed continuously since the establishment of the african union to achieve stability, the guarantor for all economic social and cultural development. therefore, mali calls on all states to adopt a multilateral approach, subregional and regional cooperation and international solidarity, with rigorous respect for the sovereignty of states. the overall situation prevailing in the middle east, in particular the conflict in iraq, remains a burning issue of the day and a major concern for the international community. we should point out to the protagonists of these conflicts that war is never anything other than a political failure and that the victories of peace are no less renowned than those of war. peace between palestinians and israelis will garner more fame than all wars combined. the parties to the conflict should be mindful of that. in addition, we invite the international community to provide aid and assistance to the palestinian people and the palestinian authority because the destruction of palestinian infrastructure and the restrictions imposed as a result of occupation have caused a clear deterioration of the socio-economic fabric of palestinian society. it is therefore to be feared that the strategy of destruction will henceforth become a constant in how conflicts unfold in general. terrorism is one of the gravest threats to human security. combating that scourge requires strengthening national and regional capacities. it should be recalled 23 that mali has ratified all international legal instruments concerning terrorism and transnational organized crime, as well as the additional protocol. it is encouraging to note that the international community, in particular the united nations, has made the campaign against the proliferation of small arms and light weapons a major focus of concern. that is particularly reassuring because, for the last ten years, small arms and light weapons have weighed on the future and destiny of the peoples of africa. their adverse affects have been a great blow to human dignity, freedom and security. mali, which since 10 may 2003 has held the presidency of the human security network, calls on all states to unite for the success of the initiative of the framework convention on international transfers of arms, currently being drafted, which is expected to be launched in bamako next october; it will be an important step towards the establishment of the mandate of the heads of state and government of the economic community of west african states to transform the moratorium on small arms and light weapons into an international convention. in addition, mali continues to be deeply concerned by the phenomenon of child soldiers and calls for vigorous action to put an end to that practice, if we wish to save future generations from the scourge of war. for many reasons, the level of security for the world's population has considerably deteriorated in recent years. even today, in many african countries, people are often caught in the grip of conflicts involving guerrillas, rebel groups, civil war, ethnic war, clan war and clashes between militias, warlords and regular army forces. designing a political strategy based on the idea of human security has now become a very urgent priority. for its mandate at the head of the human security network, mali has made its priority the issues of education in human rights, children in armed conflict, the campaign against the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, gender in peacekeeping operations and food security. in the field of economics, the government of mali is adopting stimulative fiscal measures in order to attract national and international investment, in particular in the productive areas of cotton, mines and raising livestock. but those efforts are being hampered by the effects of globalization. in fact, in agriculture in particular, it is not so much poverty that offends as the conditions that engender that poverty. to give but one example, mali like other african, caribbean and pacific (acp) countries is suffering from the cotton competition with developed countries, which each year provide five times more funds in subsidies to their farmers than they do to development assistance. those subsidies have a direct impact on world cotton prices, which are lower than they have been for 25 years. that policy of cotton production and export subsidies by certain developed countries must be abandoned, because they are contrary to the rules and principles of the multilateral trade system. they are ruining african economies, depriving our farmers of their share of the world market, and exacerbating the poverty that we undertook to eliminate at the millennium summit. on another topic, mali welcomes the adoption of the almaty programme of action, whose aim is forge partnerships that will better meet the special needs of the landlocked developing countries. we believe that that programme makes it incumbent on the international community to devise a new framework of cooperation with respect to transportation and transit a policy that will help developing landlocked countries to integrate into the world economy and to speed up their socio-economic development. to do so, it is essential that this programme of action be implemented with diligence at all levels, with the active assistance of the technical and financial partners of the landlocked developing countries. given the major changes that the world is going through today and the many challenges that it faces, africa decided to crystallize its willingness to act through two initiatives: the creation of the african union and the launching of the new partnership for africa's development. these two initiatives represent a clear and courageous vision of the way africa intends to shoulder its responsibilities with respect to its own development and its full integration into the world economy. we deeply appreciate the commitment made by the international community here at united nations headquarters to support the tremendous task of development in africa, and we welcome the actions of the group of eight aimed at establishing programmes 24 that will help translate into reality the commitments made in the african action plan. we hope that this example will be followed by the international community, because the implementation of nepad will require substantial and effective support. with respect to information and communication technologies, my delegation welcomes the upcoming holding, in december 2003 in geneva, of the first phase of the world summit on the information society, which will offer the international community, and african states in particular, the opportunity to discuss the role of those technologies and their impact on socio-economic development. the second phase will be held in tunis, africa, and we hope that the summit will adopt specific measures to promote the development of the least advanced people in these areas. the world is in crisis, and the worldwide crisis at present is largely due to humankind's inability to comprehend and to take on the responsibilities required by the new role that is required in the world. in the context of this crisis, realities have changed also for the united nations. today we have to deal with those who had previously been overlooked. for mali, the united nations remains the living incarnation of this hope for peace and security. it is an unequalled instrument. but, like any other instrument, it can worn out if it is overused, and from time to time it needs to be reinvigorated in order to be more effective, efficient and modern and to perform better. our organization is at a crossroads. to quote a contemporary author, if we keep looking towards the past to prolong it, we are doomed. if we look towards a new horizon, then our strength, our creativity and the power of our intellect will do the rest.' the past of our organization has shown its limits. we must now implement reforms that will allow us to realize our hopes for the future. global governance requires the democratization of the decision-making structures that will implement it. the current membership of the security council, for example, no longer meets the needs of our planet. its composition must reflect its universal nature. therefore, we are in favour of opening it up and expanding it to include other member states in order better to meet the complex challenges of the day. mali has taken note of the commitments made along these lines by the secretary-general in his most recent report and reaffirms the central role of the united nations in the implementation of international commitments and the fact that this can be done only if there is a dynamic and innovative partnership between developed and developing countries. the creation of the international criminal court, whose elected judges and prosecutor were sworn in this year, is certainly a success for the international community, which has fought against impunity and made it a subject of international concern. in fact, for two decades, the fight against impunity and respect for human dignity has mobilized all people of goodwill. although recent developments seem to indicate that prospects for the advent of an independent international judicial forum do not appear promising, i would recall that the path to follow involves not only resolving conflicts and establishing peace, but also requires our determination to work together. we are convinced of this, and therefore mali would plead for a strong icc a universal icc, acting as an instrument which cannot be deterred and which will help contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. in conclusion, i should like to recall that democracy, justice, freedom, peace, security, development and respect for commitments are common values that are our foundation for, and give us a sense of, our humanity. all people must be given their freedom and their dignity. we therefore call on all states to look to the future to imagine and to promote the lifestyle that corresponds to the aspirations of our people. to do so, we are determined to reject any sense of fatalism of whatever kind political, economic, social or cultural. indeed, today there are men and women who are capable, through their work and through their will, of realizing the aspirations of our peoples for well-being, peace, security, prosperity and sustainable development. now we can hope to build a new world a world that is rich in its diversity within the framework of the united nations and on new bases, a glorious world in which we can work together in a spirit of solidarity. some of those men and women, on behalf of the peoples of the world, paid with their lives for their 25 dedication to the lofty ideals of the united nations. let them always be in our thoughts and prayers. let us all work together. let us all continue to believe in the intrinsic nature of human beings in their basic dignity and kind-heartedness.",Mali,Africa,24.0,3.805599927902222,2343.0,11.0,0.0,11.0,4.694835680751174
GIN,58,2003,"on 19 august 2003, the international community took a blow to the body in baghdad in odious acts that caused the tragic loss of approximately 20 united nations officials, including the lamented sergio vieira de mello, special representative of the secretary- general. by attacking a symbol as prestigious as the united nations, the forces of evil intended to destroy the firm resolve of our organization to carry out its mission of safeguarding international peace and security. those unspeakable crimes demonstrate once again the intensity of terrorism in all its forms and underscore the vital need for the international community to reaffirm its solidarity in order to find the ways and means to stamp out this scourge, which remains one of the greatest threats to humankinds harmonious development. my delegation energetically condemns those vile acts and pays tribute to the memory of the victims. it renews to the secretary- general, mr. kofi annan, the sincere compassion of the people and government of guinea, particularly of his excellency general lansana conte, president of the republic of guinea. my delegation also wishes to take this opportunity to express its deep gratitude to mr. annan for the courage and the effectiveness with which he is leading the destiny of our organization. the republic of guinea will be unstinting in its efforts to make its contribution to the influence of the united nations, which, it hardly needs to be said, remains the primary framework for concerted action in the conduct of international relations. i wish to take this opportunity to convey my delegations warmest congratulations to you, mr. president on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the general assembly at its fifty-eighth session. appreciating your great ability, there can be no doubt that you will skilfully follow up the work of your predecessor, mr. jan kavan, whose dedication and skill were greatly appreciated in the course of the previous session. africa, where more than one third of the population lives in absolute poverty, continues, alas, to be the scene of fratricidal wars, whose negative effects undermine the development policies of its states. notwithstanding that bitter state of affairs, marked progress has been made in extinguishing hotbeds of tension. hope is reborn in west africa. sierra leone is being stabilized, thanks to the active support of the international community, but also, and above all, thanks to the patriotism of sierra leoneans and the determination of their leaders to close the book on war. my country, while expressing its appreciation for the respect shown for the criteria for the withdrawal of the united nations mission in sierra leone (unamsil), takes the view that the success of that plan also hinges on increased assistance to sierra leone, as well as the effective restoration of state authority throughout the territory. in liberia, with the departure of president charles taylor on 11 august, a new era is becoming apparent for that country, scarred by 14 years of fratricidal war, which augurs well for the subregion as a whole particularly the mano river basin, whose overall development has long been jeopardized. we wish to pay tribute to the efforts of the economic community of west african states (ecowas) and the united nations that have made it possible to secure a ceasefire and to achieve the comprehensive peace agreement in accra, thus opening the way for the establishment of a government of transition and national reconciliation. my delegation appeals to the international community for effective support for the implementation of the accra accord, so that liberians can finally be reconciled among themselves and can tackle the reconstruction of their country in renewed democracy. 7 the joint action undertaken by ecowas, the united nations and the development partners to deploy the multinational force and ensure the maintenance of peace in liberia should be supported and welcomed. the establishment of this stabilization force has proved vital to facilitate the implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement, to make it possible to carry out a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme and to promote the return of refugees and national reconciliation. however, my country remains convinced that the perpetrators of hateful crimes must answer for their acts. that is why we support unreservedly the decisions of the special court for sierra leone in its fight against impunity. that is a moral and political requirement. in cote divoire, my delegation urges all the parties to pursue dialogue to implement effectively the linas-marcoussis agreement, and thus achieve national reconciliation. in guinea-bissau, recent developments have made even more fragile a situation that was already precarious because of years of political instability and economic crisis. my delegation appeals for the creation of better conditions for a rapid return to normal constitutional life, which is vital to the recovery of that fraternal country. guinea attaches great importance to the restoration of lasting peace in our subregion. it has paid a heavy price in terms of instability, whose negative consequences have impeded its progress. despite a particularly difficult economic situation marked by the drastic drop in bauxite and aluminium prices and the soaring price of petroleum, guinea continues to tackle the burden of refugees and displaced persons. i wish to reiterate the guinean governments appeal to the donor community for increased assistance in managing refugees and displaced persons and for strengthening the capacity of our country to pursue its programme to combat poverty while consolidating its democratic achievements. i would like to address the situation in the great lakes region, where there are promising prospects. in the democratic republic of the congo, despite the humanitarian crisis in the eastern part, considerable progress has been made, particularly in the context of the disengagement of foreign armed forces and current demobilization and reintegration operations. we hope that the transitional government of national unity will do its utmost to preserve the territorial integrity of the country and to promote a return to normal constitutional life. my delegation appeals to the international community to support the united nations organization mission in the democratic republic of the congo (monuc) with the resources necessary to carry out its mandate, which has been enhanced by security council resolution 1493 (2003). in burundi, my delegation welcomes the encouraging results in the implementation of the arusha agreement and calls on all parties to put an end to hostilities to strengthen the peace, which is still fragile, and to promote humanitarian assistance. in the central african republic, my delegation appreciates the commitment of the new authorities to promote the return to constitutional legality in the context of consensual management. in the horn of africa, the permanent and binding commitment of ethiopia and eritrea concerning the delimitation of borders is a prelude to the return to peace between the two countries. with regard to somalia, my delegation hopes that the mbagathi conference in kenya will make it possible to overcome past contradictions and restore comprehensive everlasting peace. i cannot fail to address the thorny question of the western sahara, which has mobilized the energies of the international community for decades. the republic of guinea, which has always advocated a peaceful settlement of the issue, remains convinced of the urgent need for a political settlement under the auspices the united nations the only body that can guarantee a fair and lasting solution that is mutually acceptable to all parties. the future of our continent is closely bound up with international peace and security, and so we will continue to express our profound concern about conflicts that cause upheavals in other parts of the world. first, in the middle east, the appointment of prime minister mahmoud abbas, the publication of the quartets road map and the establishment of a unilateral cease-fire by the palestinian armed groups had given us grounds for hope. these hopes, 8 unfortunately, are threatened by the resumption of the cycle of violence. we have together a historic duty to salvage peace. the international community and the quartet must do everything to give a fresh impetus to the dialogue between the parties. for their part, palestinians and israelis have the obligation to honour their respective commitments, in order to win mutual trust. my delegation is convinced that a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the crisis in the middle east necessarily involves tackling the lebanese and syrian aspects and the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the security council. guinea, which has always been at the forefront in defending legitimate struggles for just causes, hails the historic role of president yasser arafat in restoring the inalienable rights of the martyred people of palestine. here we reiterate our firm opposition to any attempt to undermine his political or physical integrity, and once again send him our sympathy and support. we also encourage the new prime minister of palestine, mr. ahmed qorei, to do his utmost to create favourable conditions for dialogue aiming at a durable resolution of the israeli-palestinian conflict. on the question of iraq, which is going through a phase that is crucial for its future, my delegation encourages the united nations to continue and strengthen its peace mission and its mission of reconstruction and humanitarian assistance so that the iraqis can quickly take charge of their countrys destiny in unity and democracy. with regard to afghanistan, the international community needs to step up its assistance, particularly in the area of security and development assistance, so as to give support to the transitional administration, in implementation of the bonn agreement. my delegation urges on the korean peninsula the parties to pursue their efforts to achieve the peaceful and independent reunification of the two koreas and to settle the nuclear issue by dialogue. the guinean government reaffirms its commitment to the principle of a single china. it welcomes the efforts being made by the peoples republic of china to safeguard international peace and security. concerning the crisis in cyprus, whose resolution is still bogged down, in spite of the secretary-generals determination, we appeal to the parties to show political will, so that they may return to the negotiating table on the basis of the revised plan. poverty, armed conflicts, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, organized transnational crime and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, continue to be major obstacles to peace, security and development. safeguarding international peace and security depends on our commitment to eradicating the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, as well as mercenary activities, all of which fuel conflicts, particularly in africa. this is all the more true since in july, in this very hall, member states were able, at the first biennial meeting of states to consider the implementation of the united nations programme of action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects, were able to gauge the devastating effects of light weapons, whose major victims, unfortunately, continue to be women and children. my delegation reiterates the appeal by the economic community of west african states (ecowas) for adequate financial assistance to effectively implement the moratorium on small arms and light weapons. it also calls for effective implementation of security council resolution 1467 (2003), adopted at the end of the workshop organized by my country when it held the presidency of the council in march 2003, on the theme proliferation of small arms and light weapons and mercenary activities: threats to peace and security in west africa. mindful of their primary responsibilities for the recovery of the continent, african leaders are continuing their efforts in implementing the new partnership for africas development (nepad) effectively. the commitments undertaken at the second summit of african union heads of state at maputo are part of this process. guinea welcomes the support of the international community, particularly the g-8 countries for the african union and its programme, nepad. we also welcome the initiatives taken by development partners to increase public assistance, relieve debt and provide for improved access to markets. guinea welcomes also the useful arrangements planned by the united states, the european union and japan to combat the hiv/aids, malaria and 9 tuberculosis pandemics, as well as food insecurity. these efforts, which we encourage, were undoubtedly strengthened by the recent agreement at the world trade organization (wto) enabling the poorest countries to have access to generic drugs and thus to tackle the health tragedy of 6 million deaths annually as a result of those three pandemics alone. my delegation, however, regrets the lack of consensus at cancun at the fifth ministerial conference of the wto. we remain convinced that the international community will continue the debate, aiming at further integration of the weaker economies into the world trading system. we need to do our utmost to ensure that globalization is better managed and less iniquitous. the common good must be at the heart of our concerns. the path ahead of us is still long and full of pitfalls. the midterm review shows that, at least as far as africa is concerned, there is not great optimism abut achieving the objectives of the millennium declaration. we hope that the spirit of solidarity which is still developing at the level of the international community can be translated into tangible acts and galvanize everyone to action, so that future generations will acknowledge our struggle to ensure the development of humankind. in order to achieve this, we must reaffirm our unity and promote multilaterism to enable our common organization to tackle the challenges of peace, security and social and economic progress. the latest developments in the international situation have demonstrated the extent to which the united nations is still the unique framework for consultation and concerted action in the management of world affairs. strengthening the role and capacities of the united nations is therefore more than ever essential in order to provide fair, lasting and equitable solutions to issues of major importance. my delegation appreciates the efforts to reform the united nations and revitalize the work of the general assembly. in this regard, we support the recommendation of the secretary-general concerning the setting up of a high-level panel to propose ways to strengthen the united nations by reforming its institutions. all these steps to help improve the effectiveness of the organization must of course be underpinned by a genuine reform of the security council so as to make its membership more representative. this will make it possible to enhance its transparency and give all states, large and small, the opportunity to find a voice there and thus make their due contribution to the building of a renewed world.",Guinea,Africa,29.7040195465088,1.626129984855652,2415.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,2.070393374741201
TUN,59,2004,"it is my honour to read out the statement of mr. zine el abidine ben ali, president of the republic of tunisia and chairman of the sixteenth session of the arab league council, who had wanted to attend this meeting but was detained by urgent commitments. the statement reads as follows: it is my distinct pleasure to convey to you, sir, and to your sisterly country, the republic of gabon, my sincere congratulations on your election as president of the general assembly at this session. we wish you every success. i also wish to express to your predecessor, mr. julian hunte, my great appreciation for his excellent management of the proceedings of the previous session. i also take this opportunity to convey my thanks and appreciation to secretary-general kofi annan for his commendable efforts to promote the role of the organization and to fulfil its objectives of establishing security and peace throughout the world. tunisia reiterates its commitment to the principles and purposes of the united nations charter and reaffirms its steady resolve to continue to contribute to all efforts to reform the organization and to develop its structures, the general assembly and the security council in particular, so that it can remain the guarantor of the application of international law and the consolidation of justice, stability and development throughout the world. faced with rising tensions in many regions of the world, the widening development gap between countries and the serious challenges confronting humankind, the international community is called upon to reorganize international relations in accordance with a new vision based on cooperation, solidarity and coexistence among all peoples. that is the approach which we sought to develop at the summit conference of the arab league council hosted by my country on 22 and 23 may, the current session of which we have the honour of chairing. in addition to the outcome of the arab summit, which represents a qualitative leap in the system of joint arab action, the arab states sent a clear message to the international community. in it, they reaffirmed their commitment to a just, comprehensive and lasting peace as a strategic option in settling the arab-israeli conflict, based on the arab peace initiative, international legality, the relevant resolutions of the security council and the implementation of the road map. the community of arab states is determined to intensify its international activities to reactivate the arab peace initiative and to rally international support for it. the serious escalation of the situation in the occupied palestinian territories and israels stubborn imposition of a policy of fait accompli and unilateral measures require the international community to act promptly to end the violence against and provide international protection for the brotherly palestinian people, to lift the siege imposed on its legitimate leadership, to cease the building of settlements and to recognize the advisory opinion of the international court of justice declaring the construction of the separation wall illegal and calling for its demolition. we believe that this would help to create conditions conducive to the establishment of a new era of confidence and understanding among all parties in the region in which the peace process can be resumed, the brotherly palestinian people can recover its legitimate rights and establish its independent state, and syria and lebanon can recover all of their occupied territories. while renewing its commitment to supporting iraqs national unity and respect for its sovereignty and independence, the community of arab states stresses the need for the united nations to assume its vital role in that sisterly country. in the framework of the league of arab states, we will continue to support international efforts to demonstrate the solidarity of the arab world with the iraqi people as our contribution to establishing security and stability in that country and creating conditions conducive to its reconstruction. 7 the arab countries also support the efforts made at the united nations and regional levels, and in particular by the african union, to achieve unity, peace and development in the brotherly sudan. they also welcome the steps taken by the sudanese government to honour its commitments under the agreement to re-establish security and stability in darfur, signed on 3 july 2004 with the secretary-general of the united nations. the arab summit was an historic occasion at which the arab states reaffirmed the fact that finding just solutions to the fundamental problems of the region that have adversely affected world peace and security would reinforce the instincts of its peoples for security and peace, enhance the development process, update and consolidate the principles of human rights and democracy, and promote the role and status of women in society, in conformity with each countrys cultural specificities, conditions and abilities, and based on its own free will and commitment to shared humanitarian values. given the arab states conviction of the importance of the economic and social dimensions in strengthening the process of building the pan-arab system, our arab summit has decided to establish a common strategy for economic and social action and a plan to fight poverty and reinforce development efforts. in so doing, it has demonstrated its resolve to contribute to implementing the decisions of the millennium summit. the arab states call for the articulation of a new concept of cooperation- and solidarity-based partnership with all countries of the world consecrates the path of dialogue among cultures and anchors the values of tolerance, understanding and complementarity among them. our states and peoples hope that the international community and the influential parties will step up their endeavours to settle the pending issues in the region, support the efforts of countries to upgrade their economies, and promote their development and social programmes in the framework of cooperation and coordination between the united nations and the league of arab states. tunisia is eager to contribute to the promotion of joint arab action and seeks to give new impetus to regional cooperation. in that context, we and our brother leaders of the maghreb states are seeking to reactivate the maghreb union, which is an irreversible strategic choice and a legitimate aspiration, shared by all the peoples of the region, to greater complementarity and solidarity. our country is also eager to continue contributing to building the structures of the african union, strengthening the foundations of security and stability in africa, and establishing economic and social cooperation among african countries. that will effectively help our countries to achieve integration in the march towards prosperity and progress and to create genuine partnerships with regional groupings throughout the world. at the mediterranean level, the five plus five summit involving the maghreb countries and european countries of the southern mediterranean, held in tunis in december 2003, has made a fresh start for cooperation and solidarity-based partnership among them in the context of establishing security and stability and of achieving economic complementarity, cultural and social communication, and constructive political dialogue. serving as coordinator of the community of arab states within the euro- mediterranean process, tunisia strives to inject more efficiency and vitality into the process so as to consolidate the foundations of security, stability and development within the euro- mediterranean area. the world solidarity fund for poverty eradication, created on the basis of a tunisian proposal of 1999 and adopted by the general assembly on 20 december 2002, reflects tunisias ongoing commitment to anchoring the principles of justice, solidarity and sustainable development in the world, based on our successful pioneering national experience in that field over many years. we believe that the fund, which has become a united nations mechanism, requires all members of the international community, including governments, civil society and private sectors, to pool their efforts and swiftly mobilize the financial resources necessary to activate it. in that context, we suggest the proclamation of 20 december of each year as the 8 world day for the fight against poverty, in commemoration of the date of the general assemblys adoption of the resolution establishing the fund and in order to enshrine the concept of solidarity as a permanent universal value in international relations. we also welcome any initiative in support of the activation of the fund. in that regard, we take special note of the initiative of president luiz inacio lula da silva of the federal republic of brazil. tunisias sustained efforts to provide optimum conditions for the hosting of the second phase of the world summit on the information society on 16 to 18 november 2005 are also being undertaken in that context. we called for the convening of such a summit in 1998, based on our conviction that, today more than ever before, our world needs to establish a solidarity-based digital partnership, allowing all countries to be integrated into the international information society. in that way, we hope to achieve a more just and balanced approach as a strong development and cultural bridge between the countries of the world, in fulfilment of the goals and principles of the millennium summit. i should like to take this opportunity to reiterate my earlier invitation to heads of state and government, to representatives of civil society and the private sector and to other international organizations, extended at the first phase of the world summit on the information society held in geneva in december 2003, to participate actively in the tunis summit in order to ensure its success and to achieve the prosperity and well-being of all humankind. the general assemblys adoption of the tunisian proposal to proclaim 2005 the international year of sport and physical education was a recognition of the importance of those two activities in strengthening the bonds of friendship, cooperation and rapprochement among peoples and in further disseminating peace and development throughout the world. we are convinced that all countries recognize the noble dimensions of the proclamation and will spare no effort to formalize it within their national programmers next year. the increasing danger of the phenomenon of terrorism in our times requires greater international coordination in resisting that scourge and averting its threats by treating its root causes, finding just solutions to several outstanding international problems, and curbing poverty, exclusion and marginalization in the world. tunisia is convinced that international relations can prosper and develop only in a climate of dialogue, entente and solidarity, eschewing fanaticism, extremism and the dangers of discord and warfare and in a context of justice, mutual respect and equitable cooperation among individuals, groups and peoples. thus, security, peace and stability may prevail throughout the world and humankind may look to the future with the utmost confidence, optimism and ambition.",Tunisia,Africa,74.2969970703125,6.720789909362793,1753.0,6.0,0.0,6.0,3.4227039361095266
SLE,59,2004,"i would like to join others in congratulating you, mr. president, on your election to direct the affairs of the general assembly this great parliament of nations at its fifty-ninth session. let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor, his excellency mr. julian hunte, especially for the momentum he gave to the ongoing process of the revitalization of the general assembly. once again, in his annual report on the work of the organization and in his forthright statement to the assembly last week, the secretary-general set the tone of the annual general debate. my delegation commends him for his tenacity and courage under extreme political circumstances and shares his overall assessment of the current international situation and the role of the united nations. 20 just a little more than three weeks ago, on the initiative of the member states of the non-aligned movement, the assembly reaffirmed the central role of the united nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of international cooperation. it was, indeed, a reaffirmation that this organization was founded on international cooperation and that its efficacy is rooted in international cooperation. my delegation therefore urges all member states to adhere to the principle of cooperation. sierra leone believes, and will continue to believe in the united nations. after all, we are part of the united nations, like each and every state represented in the general assembly. of course there are some difficulties, but we strongly believe that, given adequate resources and cooperative support in a timely manner and given the necessary moral and political support, the united nations can deliver, as it has done admirably in sierra leone. in that connection, allow me to express our sincere appreciation to all the countries that have contributed to the united nations mission in sierra leone (unamsil). our thanks also go out to the staff of all the agencies and programmes of the united nations family and the non-governmental organizations that have worked in partnership with the united nations, the government and civil society to restore peace and stability in our country and, most recently, to conduct local government elections. a theme that has reverberated within the hall in the past week, and in other international forums, is the observance of the rule of law. the secretary-generals analysis of its significance needs no embellishment. the causes and character of the conflict in sierra leone, perhaps more than in any other country in the world in recent times, tell us that nearly everything crumbles when the rule of law collapses and that, therefore, it should be made the pillar of post-conflict reconstruction, national recovery, governance and administration of justice and the cornerstone of lasting peace. while the government of sierra leone is struggling, albeit with limited resources, to reform its own administration of justice, it is also concerned about the financial situation of the special court, established in the country to address impunity. the efficacy, and indeed the credibility of the court, could be questioned unless urgent measures are taken to address its budgetary problems. i should therefore like to take this opportunity to appeal for continued voluntary contributions, as well as the requested subventions from the regular budget of the united nations for the special court. as president kabbah said at the formal opening of the courthouse last march, it is a special court for sierra leone, a symbol of the rule of law and an essential element in the pursuit of peace, justice and national reconciliation for the people of sierra leone. it is also a special court for the international community, a symbol of the rule of international law. there is no guarantee that the victims of violations of international humanitarian and human rights law during the civil war in sierra leone will receive reparation for those heinous crimes. so the least we can do for them now is to ensure that justice is done. we can do so by reducing the financial burden of the special court and by demonstrating that we are indeed serious about respect for the rule of law. the united nations was formed over 50 years ago as a response to the peace and security needs of the era of its birth. since then, the world has experienced, and continues to experience, fundamental changes, to which the united nations should adapt. that is why sierra leoneans continue to follow with profound interest the consultative processes for the revitalization of the general assembly and reforms in the security council in order to reflect the reality of the contemporary world. my delegation wishes to urge the president to sustain the momentum in the processes generated by the fifty-eighth session of the general assembly. the menace of terrorism and local conflicts continues to impede peace, stability and development in many parts of the world. innocent victims aside, conflicts have reversed the development gains of poor countries, and even reduced them to the status of donor-dependants. while deploring all acts of terrorism, it is important to recognize that poor countries, particularly those emerging from conflict, have weak capacity to fight terrorism. if global action is what is needed to fight terrorism, and my delegation believes that this should be the case, efforts should be made to enhance the capacity of poor countries to play their own role in that battle. 21 after about 11 years of a violent and destructive civil conflict, sierra leone is now in the delicate post- conflict phase. it is in that phase that the root causes of the conflict should be addressed and the foundation for permanent peace, stability and sustainable development should be laid. in short, that is the phase in which the gains of the peace effort should be maximized, using a synergetic approach that incorporates development and other strands of generators of peace into peacekeeping. but this approach needs resources and planning beyond the traditional peacekeeping strategies that involve pulling out when the guns fall silent. it is in that regard that my delegation is soliciting continued and enhanced support for post-conflict sierra leone. an important component of this appeal is that development and financial institutions should understand the multifaceted demands and delicate character of post-conflict situations and treat them as special cases. that means that those institutions should revisit their rigid and standard prescriptions, with the purpose of making them flexible and responsive to the special requirements of post-conflict situations. ten days ago, the security council extended the mandate of unamsil to june 2005. the government of sierra leone has endorsed the secretary-generals assessment and recommendations regarding the benchmarks for the residual presence of unamsil in the country. we note in particular that, over the next several months, the security council will review the residual functions against the capacity of the sierra leone armed forces and police to maintain security and stability effectively throughout the country. we hope that the review will also take into consideration the security situation in the subregion. i would like to reassure the international community through the assembly that we do not expect unamsil to remain in sierra leone indefinitely. the government of sierra leone is determined to ensure a smooth and seamless transition from unamsil to the republic of sierra leone armed forces and the police throughout the country. the restructured army and the police have already demonstrated through training, discipline and performance that they are nearly ready to assume full responsibility for the security and safety of the people of sierra leone. but training is only a part of the total picture of readiness. for effective operational readiness, both the army and the police need logistical support and equipment. accordingly, my delegation wishes to appeal to friendly nations for assistance to equip our security forces to enable them to function effectively. meanwhile, for obvious reasons, the government and people of sierra leone are encouraged by the prospects for consolidating the deployment of the united nations peacekeeping mission throughout neighbouring liberia. recent dialogue between, and among, the leaders of the mano river union also augur well for peace and stability in our subregion. we need the continued support of the international community in resuscitating the objectives and programmes of the mano river union, because, if fully functional, it can complement the efforts of the economic community of west african states (ecowas) and the united nations in the subregion. in that connection, i would like to express our appreciation to the secretary-general for his encouragement of the rejuvenation process of the union. the united nations has already identified many of the root causes of armed conflict within states. with the assistance of the international community, efforts are being made to address those root causes. the objective is to prevent the recurrence of armed conflicts. my delegation believes that equal attention should also be paid to the root causes of armed conflict across states, including the senseless acts of international terrorism that are being perpetrated in many parts of the world. while prompt, effective and decisive measures are absolutely necessary to deal with the phenomenon, it is about time that we try to identify and address the root causes of such ignoble acts. new challenges are emerging and new threats are being hatched in various corners of our world with unprecedented frequency. however, we must not forget the old, unresolved challenges and threats to human safety and security. without prejudging the outcome of the secretary-generals high-level panel on threats, challenges and change, sierra leone hopes that the panels report will help to throw some light on the probable link between what could be described as old and still existing threats and those now being characterized as new threats and challenges. perhaps, as president kabbah suggested at the millennium summit four years ago, the old and still existing challenges are taking on a new form and new dimensions. what we are experiencing is, perhaps, the transmutation of threats and challenges. 22 in speaking of old challenges and threats, the question of palestine comes to mind. it has been on our agenda for far too long. we know that that is a complex issue. however, the longer it remains unresolved, the greater the risk of unending cycles of violence. sierra leone firmly believes that an equitable solution, in particular the establishment of an independent palestinian state side by side with israel within secure borders, would be a giant step towards peace and security, not only in the middle east but also in the rest of our troubled and unsafe world. still in the area of existing threats to international peace and security, my delegation is disturbed by the tragic humanitarian situation in the darfur region of the sudan. we applaud the response of the african union to the crisis and urge all stakeholders to do whatever is necessary to speedily resolve the conflict. but let me emphasize that the african union would like to do more and would do more if it had the resources. accordingly, i would like to make an open appeal, on behalf of the african union commission, for financial and material support for the african union to enable it to deal with the situation. the government and the people of sierra leone know from experience that ceasefire, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration are essential components of peace. but we are still faced with the daunting task of consolidating the peace, because peace goes far beyond the process of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants. the consolidation of peace real peace means improvements in the lives and livelihoods of all our people. it means jobs, food, education, health care, adequate housing and other social services. as the secretary-general observed in his most recent report on the united nations mission in sierra leone, considerable progress has been made towards economic and social recovery. however, in order to sustain the process of consolidating peace and to facilitate the smooth transition from recovery to sustainable development, sierra leone needs continued support, particularly for vulnerable areas of the country. we look forward to the 2005 comprehensive review of the implementation of the millennium development goals a review that will coincide with the sixtieth anniversary of the united nations. we in sierra leone will also be reviewing the state of our food security goal of ensuring that by the end of 2007, no sierra leonean will go to bed hungry. our food security goal must be seen in the context of one of the united nations millennium development goals, namely, the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger. given the grave consequences of extreme poverty and starvation, those are realistic goals. they represent the minimum standard necessary to save lives. they are attainable. we know that it is our responsibility to do more for ourselves. we also know the urgency of addressing the democratic deficit in international economic and financial decision-making. in our interdependent and increasingly globalizing world, economic and social inequities within countries are a reflection of unfair rules, unfair trade practices and an uneven playing field in international transactions. the director- general of the international labour organization, juan somavia, was correct when he told the recent african union summit in ouagadougou that good national governance will not succeed unless we have good global governance. consumers need to share, in a more equitable manner with producers in the developing world, the benefits derived from their abundant natural and human resources. that means, among other things, fair prices and debt relief, all of which should have a positive impact on our capacity to reduce poverty within our respective developing countries.",Sierra Leone,Africa,34.826789855957,3.146929979324341,2260.0,6.0,0.0,6.0,2.6548672566371683
TCD,59,2004,"first of all, on behalf of the members of my delegation and on my own behalf, i would like to congratulate you, sir, upon your election to the presidency of our assembly. your election is a great tribute to both our subregion in central africa and to your country, the gabonese republic. it is also a sign of recognition of your abilities as a statesman and a guarantee of our works success. my thanks and my congratulations also go to your predecessor and his team for their dedication and the enthusiasm with which they did a great deal of work which was much appreciated by all in a particularly tense environment marked by animated debates about the iraqi crisis. finally, i would like to pay a particular well- deserved tribute to the secretary-general of our organization, our brother kofi annan, whose commitment and unceasing efforts to establish lasting peace and sustainable development in the world are praiseworthy. he can count on chads support for all of the initiatives that he is still undertaking with courage and tenacity, particularly in dealing with the problems and conflicts in africa, initiatives through which he is thus contributing to restoring our organizations credibility. a year ago, when we addressed this assembly and reiterated our commitment to defend the great causes of mankind, we took that opportunity to condemn terrorism and all forms of blind violence and intolerance that could lead our world astray. we recalled at the time that our states needed to apply the united nations charter in reacting to terrorist acts or acts considered as terrorist that constitute a threat to international peace and security. we reiterate those appeals, and call again on the sense of responsibility of our states to act together to curb by all possible means the major scourges that are such a dangerous threat to all mankind, physically as well as socio-economically. 5 with respect to combating terrorism, the government of chad, for its part, is actively cooperating with the appropriate institutions of the united nations, under security council resolution 1373 (2001), in order to strengthen its national capacity to prevent and combat this scourge. the past year for chad, as for many african countries, was a year of serious concerns regarding the armed conflicts raging everywhere conflicts that took peaceful populations hostage, destabilized our states and continued to jeopardize the joint efforts being made to establish democratic institutions and promote socio-economic progress. let us say, however, that the accomplishments under the agenda that led to the re-election of the president of chad, his excellency idriss deby, for a second term are progressing at a reasonable rate in spite of various difficulties. this agenda, which is perfectly in line with the millennium development goals, seeks to create, through good governance, conditions that are conducive to the strengthening of peace and stability in the country so that we can promote education and health for all social strata, employment particularly for the youth and women and true synergy among the different forces and competencies arising from the various national entities. this must be done so that we can do an effective job in combating poverty and the great pandemics, such as hiv/aids and malaria. i recall here that this agenda, in which the fight against illiteracy and ignorance is written in capital letters, is based on the most important principles: peace, security and justice. without these, it will not be possible to build a society in which universal values such as democracy and the respect for human rights are ensured. in addition, the task of adapting our legislation to national and international realities was imposed on our national representation meeting, which made a commitment on 26 may 2004, to a procedure aimed at amending some provisions of the fundamental law adopted by referendum on 31 march 1996. this procedure, which will harmonize the constitution with the requirements of democracy and fundamental freedoms, is in keeping with the final provisions of the constitution, which itself authorizes the revision. in this context of globalizing economies, in which the rules of the game are constantly being subverted, in particular by the practice of the largest states of subsidizing their own agricultural products to the detriment of the poorer countries, all efforts to resolve these developmental problems have been inconclusive. even a strict application by our states of structural adjustment measures is still seriously threatened by the double weight of foreign debt and the complexity of social problems. those issues make it practically impossible to take action to stimulate economic growth in the developing countries. with the exception of oil resources, we are witnessing an ongoing decline in export earnings due to fluctuating commodity prices on international markets, and losses, caused principally by the policy of providing subsidies, continue to grow; yet states have been slow to help the least developed countries by meeting the commitments they made at successive development conferences. here, let me speak of the cotton initiative, whose purpose is to obtain compensation for harm caused by subsidies that have been detrimental to the economies of cotton-producing african countries. it is increasingly urgent to ensure respect for the laws of competition, which the states seen as the principal initiators and defenders of free markets now seem to be disregarding. as if that were not enough, in addition to the inherent difficulties of the international economic environment, those very farmers are today confronting a threat of an entirely different scope: the invasions of locusts. this raises the spectre of famine throughout the sahelo-saharan countries. chad is in a natural reproductive zone for locusts and is also considered a corridor for locust swarm migration. the situation is of even greater concern because, in addition to the other difficulties, the areas exposed to locust invasion are the ones that are protecting the sudanese refugees. our countries have taken the appropriate measures, thanks to the assistance of our partners; we have thus been able to deal with the progress of the first locust swarms. however, the threat has not disappeared. at the risk of having to manage a humanitarian crisis that could result from the destruction of food crops by the locusts, we must mobilize financial resources and the necessary technical and logistical means while we still have the time, in order to curb the scourge. we thank the countries and international 6 organizations that have helped my country, and i take this opportunity to reiterate my governments appeal to the international community for vigorous action against the threat of locusts. responses to the appeal will help us set up appropriate structures for preventive action. while speaking of natural disasters, i must mention the consequences of tropical depressions that are doing a great deal of damage and that have, in the past few weeks, claimed thousands of victims among the populations of the caribbean islands. we express our sympathy to those populations, and i would ask the wealthy nations to provide the needed assistance to help them recover from the disaster. in addition to natural disasters, armed conflicts too play a part in exacerbating the social crises from which our people are suffering. in 2004, my country and the united nations have engaged in intensive diplomatic activity related, inter alia, to the humanitarian and security situation along the border between chad and the sudan. that situation, which is the result of a conflict between the rebels of darfur, and the central government in khartoum, is of serious concern to my government. the scope of the hostilities and the violent excesses perpetrated against civilian populations by the various parties to the conflict, have provoked massive and continuous flows of sudanese refugees to the eastern and north-eastern regions of chad. that flow has consequences for our people and for the environment, whose ecosystems were already in a precarious state of fragility caused by the aridity of the soil and the climate. the president of the republic of chad quickly understood the consequences of the conflict and made a commitment to help our brothers in the sudan find a peaceful solution, by offering to mediate between the parties. he personally initiated the inter-sudanese negotiations on the darfur conflict, with the signature of the abeche agreement on 3 september 2003. that process was followed by the 8 april 2004 ndjamena agreement on a humanitarian ceasefire, and the 25 april agreement on a joint commission; these will provide a framework for negotiations on a final and comprehensive settlement of the conflict. in other words, we could not remain indifferent to the tragedy that the people in darfur were experiencing. it is our duty, more than any other country, to help our brothers in the sudan to reconcile. we have spared no effort to help president omer hassan a. al-bashir and his government, while respecting the sovereignty of their country, to resolve the darfur conflict. thus, we took the risk of exposing ourselves to criticism from the rebel movements, which accused us of favouritism, as well as the discontent of the chadian people related to the people of darfur. this clearly contradicts the widespread disinformation claiming that the government of chad might have supported some kind of rebellion against the legitimate authorities of the sudan, with which our country has close ties of friendship and cooperation in all areas. we will never stop fulfilling our mission to mediate alongside the african union to urge our sudanese brothers to renounce war once and for all and to promote sincere dialogue in order to resolve the conflict. in spite of the recent uncertainties due to the hardening of positions, we place our hope in the abuja talks under the auspices of his excellency president olusegun obasanjo of the federal republic of nigeria, current chairman of the african union. we believe that the adoption of security council resolution 1564 (2004), whose full implementation by the government of the sudan is expected in order to facilitate conditions conducive to the return of populations to their homes, will be followed by complementary measures aimed at convincing the other parties to the darfur crisis to take a constructive approach at the negotiating table. we hope that the international community will be firm with all sides in order to promote a successful conclusion of the process of a political settlement of the darfur crisis. throughout the terrible times the populations along the border of chad and the sudan have endured, international solidarity has been evident. i must express the appreciation of the government of the republic of chad for the many forms of assistance we have received from the international community, which has allowed us to help the refugees. i would also like to call upon states and organizations represented here to convey to the appropriate authorities in their countries and organizations an appeal to continue or renew humanitarian assistance to the refugees, whether from southern sudan or southern central africa, whom we are sheltering in the south of our country. 7 i would also like to ask the international community to help the populations of the host regions not only to provide shelter for the refugees but also to make possible the reconstruction of their socioeconomic structures that have been affected by the unexpected flow of refugees. the flow of refugees and their prolonged stay in chad would if we are not careful have consequences which might be dangerous to the security of my country. having agreed to abide by the international commitments it has freely entered into, chad is receiving the refugees and looking out for their safety. in the long term, the international support that my country enjoys should focus on promoting the voluntary return, within a short and reasonable time, of refugees to their countries of origin. international assistance to refugees must therefore be designed and conducted so as not to perpetuate the presence of the refugees in chad. while we are working together with the international community to ease the pain of the refugees on our soil, we say frankly that we can in no way tolerate chad being used as a base for subversive actions, for acts of terrorism or for the conduct of hostile or destabilizing actions against the institutions of the refugees countries of origin. thus, the government of chad will act, with all the unambiguity reflected in its current position, against refugees who become involved in such activities. the gravity of the humanitarian and security situation born of the crisis that is raging in darfur has not deflected my countrys attention from other similar concerns on the continent. we are following attentively and with great interest the evolution of other conflicts that are taking place in africa and in other parts of the world. we are pleased to see the efforts being made within the african union and the united nations to find lasting solutions; we are available to help as best we can. therefore, the government of chad has decided to respond to the needs outlined by the department of peacekeeping operations by making available to the united nations a contingent of 150 qualified men. on this solemn occasion, how could we fail to recall the unjust and undemocratic situation that characterizes the structures of our organization? i would like to say firmly that my country remains committed to the common african position regarding the restructuring of the united nations, including the enlargement and reform of the security council in order to ensure equitable representation of all regions. all the initiatives taken by secretary-general kofi annan regarding united nations reform are much appreciated by my country, which awaits with interest the outcome of the deliberations under way. the objective is the revitalization of the united nations. all suggestions should help us to improve the performance of the principal organs and the functioning of present and future funds and programmes. to that end, my country would expect account to be taken of the concerns and viewpoints of member states and groups of states that have been reiterated on many occasions in the assembly. chad awaits with equal interest the outcome of the study on globalization: the current characteristics and direction of globalization by no means enable weaker or transitional economies to benefit fully from the opportunities it offers. another injustice should be pointed out. i must draw the assemblys attention to the question of the exclusion from our ranks of a large community of the 23 million men and women of the republic of china on taiwan. those men and women, who increasingly are asserting themselves in international trade and are generating wealth throughout the world, deserve to be fully associated in decision-making on subjects and in areas with an impact on their lives and those of all humankind. the united nations would have everything to gain and nothing to lose with their active participation in debates on the many topics of international concern. their contribution would undoubtedly enrich the assembly debates and would help us build the operational capacity of our world institutions, funds and programmes. the distressing legacy of armed conflicts includes buried caches of abandoned munitions and unexploded ordnance and, in particular, anti-personnel mines. referring to the danger of landmines, the secretary-general has said that these abominable weapons, buried by the millions, are not only waiting silently to kill or maim innocent children and women, but their presence or even the threat of the presence of one single landmine can put a stop to crop cultivation, deprive an entire village of its livelihood and thus place one more obstacle along the difficult path to reconstruction and development. chad is 8 actively participating in the preparations for the ottawa convention review conference soon to be held in nairobi and will continue to act to eliminate all of these arms so as to attain the objective of an earth without mines. i would like to take this opportunity to thank, without exception, all the states and all the intergovernmental and non-governmental institutions that have helped us establish and implement our humanitarian demining programmes. we ask them for their continued generosity, and we ask them to extend their assistance to survivors among the victims of landmines, to help design and implement programmes enabling these individuals to be reintegrated socially and professionally. i appeal to all united nations member states to join in this humanitarian undertaking by acceding to the ottawa convention banning anti- personnel landmines.",Chad,Africa,28.3814296722412,1.592949986457825,2726.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.467351430667645
BFA,60,2005,"burkina faso is delighted to see this important session of the general assembly being presided over by an illustrious son of a great country, sweden, with which we have maintained exemplary and fruitful relations of friendship and cooperation for several decades. i hasten to assure the president of the full cooperation of my delegation. it is also my pleasure to pay a tribute to his predecessor, mr. jean ping, whose talents as a seasoned and effective diplomat we have been able to appreciate throughout the fifty-ninth session of the general assembly. i would like to associate in this tribute the secretary-general, a man of great vision, who has been the architect of this new united nations that we have so earnestly sought and who has had the courage to lay its foundations. the current session will receive specific notice in the annals of the united nations. apart from its coinciding with both the midterm review of the millennium development goals and the reform of the organization, this session is also being held at a watershed in world history and international relations. in africa, despite the constant efforts of states and regional groupings, the persistence of numerous conflicts and hot spots continues to be a subject of major concern. i am thinking particularly of the situation in the great lakes region, darfur, somalia and cote divoire. in the middle east, the struggle for survival is the daily battle of the palestinian people. it is our conviction that only the strict implementation of the road map will make peace possible in that sorely tried region. the numerous terrorist acts throughout the world claim our attention and remind us of how vulnerable we are in the face of terrorism. we must, henceforth, realize that no strategy, no matter how energetic it might be, will be able to wipe out this scourge, unless it attacks the underlying causes, which are injustice, exclusion, humiliation and poverty. it is quite obvious that desperate behaviour stems from those sources. more than ever, the quest for democracy, good governance and respect for human rights has become part and parcel of the daily behaviour of peoples and nations. it is this vision that makes it so necessary that unprecedented reform be carried out of the united nations, which, 60 years after its creation, is duty bound to take full account of the new challenges and new problems that have arisen. in this connection, once again we should welcome the secretary-generals lucidity and farsightedness, whose report in larger freedom (a/59/2005) gives us a thought-provoking framework, indicating that comprehensive and thorough reform is essential for our organization. furthermore, the african position on this reform, particularly that relating to the security council, is now well known. burkina faso is convinced that justice must be done to africa and has fully joined the other members of the african union to formulate a common platform that will make it possible for africa to reclaim without hesitation its legitimate place in the essential united nations decision-making bodies. 7 nevertheless, however committed and however passionate our debate is on the reform of the united nations, it is of paramount importance that we give even greater priority to the question of development. speaking of development, as is so aptly pointed out in the final document of the high-level meeting that we have just adopted, it is not so much promises and commitments that are lacking but rather their diligent and consistent fulfilment, given the urgency and acuteness of the problems we face. under these circumstances, burkina faso willingly associates itself with all activities that promote genuine international solidarity. that is why we have associated ourselves with president lula da silvas anti-hunger initiative. that is also why we support president jacques chiracs international solidarity contribution initiative involving an airline ticket levy, which is aimed at helping to finance the struggle against aids, tuberculosis and malaria; prime minister tony blairs international finance facility; qatars fund for development and humanitarian assistance; and president george w. bushs millennium challenge account, of which my country has just become a beneficiary. burkina faso also welcomes the g-8s recent decision to cancel the multilateral debts of a number of developing countries. we hope that additional countries will be included on that list. there can be no doubt that trade relations between industrialized and developing countries continue to be marred by inequality even inequity. it is therefore essential to recall the need to respect the rules of the multilateral trading system, which are the foundation of the world trade organization. it should therefore be clear why burkina faso continues to demand an end to the unfair export subsidies of the countries of the north, particularly as concerns cotton. burkina faso is a staunch proponent of democracy, good governance, respect for human rights, and peace and development in africa and throughout the world. in that context, it is actively involved in peacekeeping operations in africa and in other regions. furthermore, my country, which currently holds the chairmanship of the community of sahelo-saharan states and of the international organization of la francophonie, is proud to serve the cause of regional integration and of international brotherhood and solidarity. we believe that working for peace also means respecting international conventions. we therefore believe it to be our duty to discharge our international obligations by acceding to most of the relevant agreements and treaties, such as the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty, which burkina faso has signed and ratified. i should like to take this opportunity to encourage other countries to do likewise in order to speed up the coming into force of that legal instrument, whose importance for world peace and stability is fully evident. i hardly need recall that the current sessions leitmotif is the democratization of the united nations. it is therefore rather difficult to understand how we can continue to disregard the rights of 23 million taiwanese people. the time has come to deal justly with that people, which for decades now has demonstrated its commitment to democracy, peace and international solidarity. today more than ever, the fate of humankind is in our hands. moving in concert, in the same direction and inspired by the same principles, we must assume our new common responsibility: to build a world in larger freedom, with development, security and dignity for all.",Burkina Faso,Africa,23.5221996307373,3.941139936447144,1050.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,3.8095238095238093
MDG,60,2005,"no one here took part in the first general assembly in 1945. we can only imagine how at the end of the second world war men and women full of hope were prompted by a firm resolve to change and make the world better. they were right. the shortcomings and weaknesses of our organization should not in any way detract from the leading role of the united nations in the world. do we today share the same spirit that inspired our predecessors? at the end of this general assembly will we feel that we have improved the world? we welcome the draft outcome document. we also welcome recent resolutions adopted by the 4 security council on counter-terrorism and conflict prevention, particularly in africa. we support the early establishment of a human rights council so as to promote democracy. however, the results of the summit meeting do not fully correspond with africas aspirations. what is lacking is that long-hoped-for impetus that would enable every member state to express its views, give hope to our peoples, preserve the balance of nature and enable us to ensure the futures of all the worlds children. we need to further strengthen our efforts by trying fresh approaches. first of all, it is high time to strengthen the role of the general assembly. it is also time for africa to be better represented within united nations bodies, and in particular on the security council. that is a matter of justice, but it is also a necessity for the development of our continent. having africas voice heard on the international level and allowing it to share in responsibilities on a global level are marks of concern and respect for our states and our peoples. let us put an end to the exclusion of the african continent. we want to make our full and complete contribution to debates and decision-making on issues that concern how our world works. the discussions in recent months have focused on institutional reform at the united nations. that is a very important question. it is also important for africa. but we would ask you to expand the discussion so as to properly define the role that the organization should play in world development. the united nations should be more than just a crisis management body a body that addresses poverty, disasters and emergencies. let us convert it into a body that inspires us with hope. let us work together for development, justice and equity. the sixtieth anniversary of the united nations should mark the beginning of a new era in which we will have the opportunity to build a more prosperous, more just, more democratic and more environmentally aware world a world that is sounder, healthier, more responsible and more united. we need to work out strategies and plans that arouse enthusiasm among nations and attract the fervent hopes of our peoples. we will only change the world if we can secure the support of our populations. the united nations must devise and adopt the necessary measures to establish a more balanced world. all the crises, the wars, the questions of security and terrorism, the worlds epidemics all of those have concrete causes. the secretary-general rightly quoted one of the united nations purposes from the preamble to the charter: to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. our peoples want to have real opportunities. quite rightly, they call for the favourable conditions that will allow them to take advantage of those opportunities. our organization is 60 years old. much has been achieved in decolonization and peacekeeping, for instance. five years ago we defined the millennium development goals. now we must go still further. let us devise a genuine global strategy for development, a strategic partnership with a clear-cut vision and more ambitious goals. as regards africa, what is lacking is a clear vision of its future. it can be seen that africa is still a poor continent. nonetheless, africa has the potential to be rich. the previous general assembly provided me with an opportunity to propose a marshall plan for africa. the prime minister of the united kingdom made the same proposal and the president of the world bank, mr. paul wolfowitz, has also spoken of a plan of action for africa. let us ask other donors to join in this initiative. the marshall plan for africa should cover much more than a call to cancel debt and increase financial support. it should take into account africas potential and the right steps that are needed to realize it. it should build a positive image of our continent and determine the role that it could play in economic, political, social and cultural spheres. globalization highlights the economic dimension of international relations. however, we need to invest more in the social dimension of development by enhancing the role of the economic and social council so as to meet the legitimate aspirations of our peoples. the future of africa lies, of course, with its children. the plan for africa should describe how we can approve the transfer of knowledge and how we can ensure access for young africans to the worlds knowledge and expertise, so that the intellectual potential of millions of people will not be wasted. we need to increase literacy levels. we also need an educational system that meets international 5 standards of quality and effectiveness a system that will foster creativity and help our peoples to realize their dreams; a system that will optimize our countries human resources so as to enable us to play an important role in the world economy; a system which will help to close the digital divide among nations. saving african children also means feeding them. in that respect, overcoming hunger in africa is an urgent challenge, as millions of people will be affected by this crisis. madagascar, as a new member of the southern african development community, urges the general assembly to make that crisis its highest priority. we must act rapidly and with resolve. let us also improve the situation of women. they deserve to play a more significant role in civil society and in the economic and political arena. i have personally been asked by the water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) project to share their concerns with you. indeed, one of the most burdensome daily chores of african women is providing a family with water. access to drinking water for all frees women from servitude and thus preserves their dignity. moreover, the issue of water management is inseparable from those of sanitation and hygiene. water is a source of life and a great economic asset. the development of hydroelectric energy is one solution to africas energy deficit. let us not forget that rational water management will enable us to achieve food self-sufficiency. such a marshall plan should include the protection and development of natural resources, which are crucial to our continent. to that end, we have a vision, which we call madagascar, naturally. two years ago in durban, i announced our decision to triple the extent of protected areas in the country so as to ensure the preservation of our rich and unique biodiversity. we took the decision to earmark 8 per cent of funds stemming from the cancellation of external debt for the funding of our protected-area system. the african continent already is involved in the preservation of natural resources for the world and will increase its efforts in that area. let us focus on agribusiness by creating more opportunities for processing our natural products and thus enhancing the value-added that they bring to our countries. this is the approach that madagascar is taking now, with the support of donors. let us foster initiatives to establish a fair and equitable trading regime among nations, such as the reduction of trade barriers. in short, such a marshall plan should make it clear that the african continent can prosper by shouldering its responsibilities. we need to speak more of our assets than of our weaknesses. we need to speak of our potential rather than our lack of resources. the world wants to invest in our potential. let us find a fresh approach. let us create a new image, a new, clear vision for africa. it is only through such a vision, along with a genuine global strategy for development, that the millennium development goals can be achieved. such an approach must incorporate the various international and bilateral programmes and projects whose differing structures, objectives and content make them complicated to manage and hinder the identification of possible synergies. but it is incumbent on us to ensure the effective coordination of development and thus adopt the concept of country ownership. we in madagascar have taken the initiative of setting up national programmes in which all donors projects are incorporated. the world must heed the needs of africa, but africa must also face up to its responsibilities by strengthening democracy, good governance and the rule of law. the discussions on the role and the structure of the united nations which have taken place in the context of the sixtieth anniversary offer us an exceptional opportunity. let us create more equitable structures that are better suited to todays needs and realities. let us draw inspiration from the spirit of the founding fathers of our organization. let us be nations united in spirit, with a global vision and strategy of development for a world that is not only more dynamic but also more balanced, more equitable and more responsible. let us work towards that end.",Madagascar,Africa,58.9359397888184,3.309639930725098,1589.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,3.1466331025802394
BFA,61,2006,"madam president, burkina faso is pleased to see you presiding over the general assembly at its sixty-first session. please be assured of the full cooperation of my delegation, which will spare no effort to help your noble mission succeed. i would also like to express our gratitude to mr. jan eliasson, minister for foreign affairs of sweden, who successfully guided the work of the assembly at the sixtieth session. this session is being held at a time when peace and security are seeing their foundations severely shaken in several regions of the world. areas of tension persist in africa, despite recent efforts to dispel them. that is the case, for example, in the sudan, somalia and cote divoire. fortunately, fighting has ceased in several countries, thus opening up real opportunities for progress and development. in liberia, sierra leone, guinea-bissau and burundi, democracy and building the rule of law have now become a reality. that is proof that nothing, absolutely nothing, can replace the political will of people to engage fully in inclusive and constructive dialogue. we very much hope that the democratic process which is under way in the democratic republic of the congo will be successfully pursued. likewise, we welcome the progress made in the inter- togolese political dialogue. having had the privilege of following that process as a facilitator, president blaise compaore has been able to sense fully the degree of determination of the togolese political leaders. that is why we reiterate the appeal he made to togos partners to provide the support necessary for the economic revitalization of togo. the crisis in cote divoire is at a decisive turning point. we are convinced that with the firm and sincere commitment of all parties and the support of the international community a lasting solution can be found very quickly. in the middle east, we have watched a disturbing escalation in the violence in recent months. since the causes of that conflict are sufficiently known to all, there is no reason to go into them here. while welcoming the adoption of security council resolution 1701 (2006) and the deployment of an expanded united nations interim force in lebanon (unifil), burkina faso strongly hopes that negotiations will continue and intensify at all levels in order to achieve a global and lasting peace in that region, a peace that will restore the sovereignty of lebanon, provide freedom for the palestinian people and ensure israels security. the question of free and fair international trade remains on the table. the collapse of the doha development round is proof of this, and it has shown us the need to search for the best way to ensure that the rules of the multilateral trading system set by the world trade organization are strictly observed. for burkina faso, which has thrown its full weight behind the interests of african cotton producers, this requirement is more imperative than ever. sustainable development, the reduction of poverty and the elimination of hunger and precariousness in the world still constitute challenges that must be faced. over and above what has been done to reduce debt and find innovative financing mechanisms, which we welcome, the international community must work to forge a true north-south partnership that will guarantee fair treatment of the questions of concern to all the regions and countries in the world. the midterm review of the implementation of the brussels programme of action for the least developed countries, held several days ago, and its conclusions suggest that we are moving in the right direction. the sheer scale of international migration in recent years, together with the daily tragedies experienced by thousands of young people who risk their lives, presents a new challenge caused by accelerated globalization. to deal with the problem, the countries of origin, transit and destination must find more imaginative solutions that go to its root causes, as neither barriers, nor borders, nor interdiction, nor forced repatriation can be an adequate, much less a sustainable, response. that is why we welcome the results of the euro-africa conference on migration and development, held on 10 and 11 july 2006 in rabat, the initiatives taken by the african union to prepare a joint african policy on migration and the 29 06-53323 conclusions of the high-level dialogue on international migration and development, held recently in new york at the margins of the current session. the unprecedented rise in the price of a barrel of oil and the resulting energy crisis have hit our countries hard. the economies of african countries that do not export oil, such as burkina faso, will take a long time to recover. this crisis means that we must find not only innovative forms of international solidarity but also alternatives to fossil fuels. with this reality in mind, burkina faso has already decided to make the development of biogas from the waste of plant crops, such as cotton, one of its priorities. the question of nuclear energy has been on the agenda of most of our meetings for some time. burkina faso reiterates its firm condemnation of the arms race in general and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in particular. it is now imperative that we give full force to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. however, we must do so without prejudice to the rights of all states to develop, produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. in the name of democracy and justice, we have all sought to create a new united nations, a symbol of modern governance and efficiency in its management of world affairs. that is why we have undertaken to ensure deep-rooted reform of the organization and its working methods. africa in particular is dedicated to that cause because we are convinced that it is the only way to put right an unjustice that has festered over decades. change was launched with the creation of the peacebuilding commission and the central emergency response fund, the conversion of the commission on human rights into the human rights council, and the adoption of the global counter-terrorism strategy. we must now all work together to ensure that multilateralism and universalism triumph over unilateralism. to that end, we need a strong and democratic united nations that is open to all peoples who seek peace and justice. that spirit of openness and universalization in the organization must be a component of a genuine and irreversible democratic movement. that is why we must do justice by the 23 million taiwanese whose only aspiration has always been to play an active role in our common endeavour to build a better world. in that respect, burkina faso is very pleased to welcome montenegro as the 192nd member of the united nations. on behalf of my country, burkina faso, i wish now to pay special tribute to secretary-general kofi annan, who, with commitment, tact, selflessness and unprecedented efficiency has breathed new dynamism into the organization over the past 10 years and rejuvenated the founding elements of the new united nations that we have dreamed of for decades. as he prepares to move on from this important chapter in his life, we wish him every success in his future activities. the aspirations of our peoples are vast. just as we must strive to optimize governance globally, we must also work to entrench local governance, democracy and freedom. that is the only way we will be able to satisfy those legitimate aspirations and to bequeath to future generations a world of peace that is reconciled to itself.",Burkina Faso,Africa,22.4725799560547,3.982189893722534,1248.0,6.0,0.0,6.0,4.807692307692308
BEN,61,2006,"i am taking part personally in this session of the general assembly in order to reiterate benins commitment to the noble purposes and principles of the united nations, and to express the readiness of the beninese delegation to cooperate and contribute, as best it can, to the success of these deliberations. but first, allow me, to once again warmly congratulate ms. haya rashed al-khalifa on her unanimous election to the presidency of the general assembly at its sixty-first session, and to express our appreciation for the remarkable way in which she guided the work of the high-level meeting on the midterm comprehensive global review of the implementation of the programme of action for the least developed countries for the decade 2001-2010. i also wish to pay tribute to the remarkable efforts of her predecessor, his excellency mr. jan eliasson, minister for foreign affairs of the kingdom of sweden, who had the weighty task of leading the sixtieth session of the general assembly, which was focused, essentially, on the implementation of the major decisions taken at the 2005 world summit. allow me to pay a resounding tribute to my friend secretary-general kofi annan, who over the past 10 years has wisely and skilfully led our organization at a time of new challenges and threats created by changes unprecedented in the history of humanity. my country, benin, believes that the future secretary-general should come from the continent of asia. we hope that the new secretary-general will be able to take the measures necessary to lead the organization towards the achievement of the millennium development goals (mdgs). i am pleased to note that the assembly is already progressing in the preparation of this great endeavour: the promotion of development is the key issue for the general debate at the sixty-first session, focusing in accordance with ms. al-khalifas proposal, on the establishment of a global partnership for development. my country, the republic of benin, joins in this debate with the conviction that we will make significant progress in finding pragmatic ways of fulfilling the commitments that have been adopted on many occasions, for the promotion of economic and social development throughout the world. the question of development is at the heart of the mission of the united nations. in the charter, members proclaimed their belief in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small. they made the commitment to use international institutions in order to encourage economic and social progress for all people. hence, reform of the united nations, if it is to be viable and effective, must also help ensure that our organization can do better as a framework and an instrument for development through the promotion of the well-being of the poorest of our planet, ensuring the economic growth of the most vulnerable members of the community of nations, in particular the least developed countries. financing for development is a factor on which genuine partnership needs to be built between donor countries and developing countries. in this context, the monterrey consensus, as members know, continues to be relevant. it is good to note that some donor countries have achieved the objective of allocating 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to official development assistance (oda) for developing countries, with 0.2 per cent earmarked for least developed countries. it is also important to encourage those who have already established a specific timetable for achieving those objectives. given the inadequacy of official development assistance, it is important to examine new sources of financing for development activities, and some are already doing so. i would like to take this opportunity to welcome the proposals that have been made by some countries, such as the french republic and president jacques chirac. identifying new sources of financing thus deserves special attention. we are pleased that mobilizing the remittances of migrant workers can in some respects also contribute to development action. nonetheless, it is important to facilitate those transfers so that they can effectively contribute to improving the living conditions of the beneficiary populations and their impact on poverty reduction can be maximized. but it should be stressed that the resources that come from remittances by migrant workers cannot be 06-52885 14 considered part of oda and should not be included in oda calculations. we must also mobilize resources through microcredits for the poorest sectors. the support of the international community should contribute to strengthening microcredit systems, which could be extremely useful in the context of efforts to counteract unemployment among young people and to promote the empowerment of women in order to improve their living conditions and enhance their contribution to the national income of the countries concerned. we must ensure the full insertion of developing countries, particularly the least advanced, into international trade so that they can be sure that, through that mechanism appropriate resources for financing their development are mobilized. here we express our disappointment at the failure of the multilateral trade negotiations in the framework of the doha round. among other reasons, they floundered because of the crucial question of agricultural subsidies, which are stifling the producers in developing countries. my country, benin, will continue to work with other affected countries to ensure the abolition of those subsidies. or at least to get compensations equal to the harm we suffer. in order to promote development, our countries are seeking to implement democratic reforms. however, as i said at the opening session of the meeting of the least developed countries, any democracy that does not go hand in hand with development is doomed to fail. also, our efforts to promote development will not bear fruit if we do not succeed in maintaining peace in our own countries and throughout the world. that is why in 2005 benin, while it was on the security council, sought to contribute to the efforts to enhance the effectiveness of that body in preventing armed conflicts. we welcome the secretary-generals prompt action through the inspired and wise recommendations he recently submitted on questions related to the prevention of conflicts. resolving various conflicts enables the affected developing countries to resolutely get themselves back on the track of reconstruction and national development. from this rostrum, my country pays tribute to the decisive action being taken by the united nations in the area of peacekeeping, and we repeat that we are willing to contribute actively to it. the government of benin is ready to continue participating in peacekeeping operations in order to allow peoples affected by armed conflicts to overcome them and to create the conditions for stability that are necessary to ensure the reconstruction of their countries and their economic and social development. for us in benin, another word for peace is development. this is the message that i wished to bring, on behalf of the people of benin and of the least developed countries, during this general debate.",Benin,Africa,28.7021102905273,2.563400030136108,1143.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,3.499562554680665
SEN,61,2006,"senegal and the kingdom of bahrain have had cordial relations of friendship, which have been enhanced and strengthened by reciprocal confidence and esteem. i am therefore pleased that ms. haya rashed al-khalifa is presiding over the general assembly at its sixty-first session, during a key time in the history of our organization. her election was an act of faith in the ideals of the united nations and a message of hope for peoples who dream of a fairer, more equitable and more welcoming world for all. i offer her my warmest congratulations and assure her of the full cooperation of the senegalese delegation as she carries out her high responsibilities in the service of the international community. i would also like to convey to the secretary- general a fraternal message of my greatest appreciation and gratitude for the ability and effectiveness with which he has always acted, enabling our organization to better adapt to the requirements of the new millennium. at a time when he is preparing to leave his high post after 10 years of loyal and good service, it is with a sincere sense of pride that i say to him as an african compatriot, mr. secretary-general, mission accomplished. last year, in this very hall, we renewed our commitment to meet the millennium development goals (mdgs) by 2015. to be sure, since that time, some praiseworthy initiatives have occurred along the way, especially with measures to erase the multilateral debt of 18 least developed countries (ldcs) and to establish a levy on air tickets as a source of financing for development. i salute the efforts made by president jacques chirac of france and by president luiz inacio lula da silva of brazil for their promotion of this innovative mechanism to mobilize resources. the problem of debt, however, in particular the debt of our continent, remains a hindrance to our development. in reality, the first question we should be asking ourselves, and which we do ask in africa, 5 06-53005 regards the evaluation of the debt: to take a look at the overindebtedness of africa, to see exactly how much we owe, because it turns out that some countries are paying more than they owe. this is why i have long been advocating an x-ray of african debt to see how our countries have ended up in a situation whereby they devote much of their export earnings to paying off debt, contracted sometimes in dubious circumstances, to the detriment of their economic and social development programmes. the vicious circle of debt, compounded by unfair imbalances in international trade owing to agricultural subsidies in wealthy industrialized countries, has been particularly harmful for our farmers. the failure of the agriculture negotiations in the doha round, which is still fresh in our memory, shows how far we have yet to go in order to ensure respect by all for the rules of the game, so that world trade can be equally profitable for the giants of agro-business as for the small-scale cotton growers of senegal, benin, burkina faso and mali, or for the small-scale coffee planters from uganda, ghana and cote divoire. we say yes to free trade, but it must be fair and equitable. the dizzying increase in the price of oil and its by-products since 2003 constitutes a new source of concern for non-producer countries. if the current trend continues, many countries will see their years of economic and social development efforts wiped out by the cost of oil. it will then be pointless to expound on the millennium development goals on schooling, universal health care, access to drinking water for all, the fight against unemployment and the eradication of poverty. in africa, we have decided to take up the challenge by gathering together, on the initiative of senegal, in the association of non-oil producing african countries, in order to promote the development of bio-fuels. this green version of the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) has already been launched. with its vast cultivatable lands and enormous fresh water resources, africa has, without a doubt, incomparable advantages in this sphere, and could even aspire to become the worlds premier bio-fuel producer. i would call upon all interested parties to join with us in this new green energy revolution, especially since it respects our environment and is in perfect harmony with the objectives of the united nations framework convention on climate change and its kyoto protocol. let us be optimistic in thinking that our planet will be a healthier place in the interest of all peoples, thanks to a civilization based on clean energy. turning to the situation in africa, senegal welcomes the progress made in democracy on the continent, as well as the significant progress achieved in the peaceful settlement of disputes. such positive developments, however, have been thwarted by the persistence of some hotbeds of tension. in the sudan, we hope and work for the expansion of the camp of peace, so that those protagonists who have thus far been left out of the peace process can sign the abuja agreement for a settlement of the darfur crisis. yesterday, here in new york, the peace and security council of the african union addressed the issue of darfur and emphasized that africa must offer more efforts, more sacrifices and more commitment, but that it can find a solution only within the framework of close cooperation with the united nations, for which it must indicate its readiness. turning to the democratic republic of the congo, senegal welcomes the holding of elections last july. we hope that, whatever the outcome of the second round of presidential elections on 30 october, a reconciled congolese people will work in the spirit of unity to utilize the tremendous potential of their country for peace, national unity and economic and social progress. to my ivorian brothers and sisters i would like to solemnly state that the need for a cote divoire, healed of its wounds for good, has become most urgent as much for themselves as for all of us in the subregion. i would thus urge ivorian leaders of all ideologies to show that they can get beyond their differences to foster a return to lasting peace, more in accordance with the history of that brother country and with its proper destiny within the west african family and within our continent. with regard to the digital solidarity fund, which i proposed in december 2003 at the world summit in the information society, as information technology and communications coordinator of the new partnership for africas development (nepad), i am pleased to report that we have had satisfactory results. since being launched in march 2005 with the support of nearly all members of the united nations, the fund has gained the formal support of the peoples republic of 06-53005 6 china. i would like warmly to thank the chinese authorities for their support, which surely bolsters the funds universal nature. i request all states that have not yet done so to formalize their previously voiced commitment to the fund by sending a letter to the executive secretary of the fund in geneva. i would recall that cities too can become members. i take this opportunity also to recall that the digital solidarity fund is supported exclusively through voluntary public and private contributions, the amount of which is up to member states, cities or local governments. we would suggest that countries commit themselves to the so-called geneva principle, which consists of, including in calls for bids in the digital technology field, a contribution to the fund of 1 per cent of the value of the goods and services linked to information and communications technology. fund resources are managed in strict transparency through the foundation council with a tripartite membership: local authorities, private enterprise and civil society. the general assemblys recent high-level dialogue on international migration and development shows the extent to which we must continue our joint efforts to address an extremely relevant and complex problem which will be with us for a long time to come. international migration has always been a part of the history of peoples. what is new is the current scope and form of illegal immigration. for a wide variety of reasons, with north-south imbalances not the least of them, illegal migration necessitates an approach of joint partnership instead of unilateral solutions. in senegal, we have already decided to resolutely combat this phenomenon by strengthening the surveillance of our coasts with the support of our european partners. we have already signed an agreement with spain, and we shall sign a similar agreement with france next week. the purpose of these agreements is to regulate migratory flows to developed countries, thereby combating illegal migration. the smugglers, largely responsible for this, are constantly being hunted down and punished in accordance with the law. along with the dismantling of clandestine networks, we have launched our return to agriculture programme, through which we are setting up rural farms in order to enable our young people to engage in modern agriculture and animal husbandry. this will give them reasons to stay at home and avoid tragic ventures which often end at the bottom of the sea or in the desert. that is how we implement the principle we have adopted in senegal: zero illegal emigration. the year 2006 marks a decisive turning point in the history of the united nations, with reforms under way to adapt to changing world realities. these include the establishment of the human rights council and the peacebuilding commission, which i hope will allow for enhanced promotion of human rights and more effective management of post-conflict periods. as for security council reform, senegal deplores the deadlock in the negotiations, which is to the detriment of regions such as ours. africa, while it is the focal point of the councils agenda, does not have a single permanent seat. that is a historical injustice which must be corrected as soon as possible by granting africa a seat, with the right to veto, apart from the overall reform package. the palestinian people, too, are victims of injustice, depriving them of a legitimate right to a viable, free and independent state. history teaches us that war, despite its long list of innocent victims and the toll it takes on civilian infrastructure bitter experiences recently relived by the peoples of lebanon and palestine will never overcome a peoples will if it aspires to take its rightful place in the community of free nations. the right to freedom and independence is part of the destiny of peoples. its attainment can be delayed by historic circumstances, but destiny will always be achieved. it is better to understand this in time than to regret it too late. as chairman of the committee on the exercise of the inalienable rights of the palestinian people, senegal will continue to ensure that the organization continues its efforts towards a negotiated, just and lasting solution to the middle east conflict so that all of the suffering peoples of the region can finally live in peaceful coexistence. with regard to iran, the assembly is aware of my position. there should be dialogue without prior conditions, meaning that the protagonists should sit down around a negotiating table. senegal has always acted in the service of peace and continues to do so more than ever before at a time when we face such major challenges.",Senegal,Africa,41.8911514282227,3.821379899978638,1896.0,7.0,0.0,7.0,3.691983122362869
TGO,61,2006,"first, on behalf of our delegation, i warmly congratulate the president on her election to preside over this session, which encourages the government of togo in its commitment to value the role of women in our society. togo remains convinced that the specific insights of women in the management of national or international affairs will make a big contribution to giving a more united and human face to relations between peoples and nations. the president can rest assured that as she does her inspiring job togo will continue to support her unstintingly. i also pay a merited tribute to the presidents predecessor, mr. jan eliasson, whose competence, moderation, sense of compromise and character earned him the respect and esteem of all during the last session. in addition, i pay particular tribute to the secretary-general, and express to him our sincere gratitude for his tireless efforts for peace, democracy and development. we appreciate his commitment and his bold proposals to ensure substantial and fair reform of the united nations. in our quest for peace, security and socio- economic development togo has just reached a critical stage in its history, with the signing on 20 august of the comprehensive political agreement at the end of an open, constructive and inclusive dialogue. when the head of state took the initiative to resume the political dialogue we were aware that our current stage of social and political development would not allow us to deal with all matters of discord or eliminate all political and institutional problems. it was necessary first to strengthen the dynamic of national mobilization and social cohesion by promoting a policy of openness, calm and national reconciliation. the desired results have largely been achieved, with the effective and active participation of all the major political participants in the dialogue. everyone was able to speak freely on the substantive problems that were feeding the persistent feeling of crisis. the frank and responsible discussions, and the conclusions reached, enable us to establish bolder conditions for reform and lay the foundations for a new covenant for the republic and for national harmony. the conclusions of the national dialogue favour the holding of free and democratic elections. additionally, the resolution of the dialogue regarding the need to re-examine the role and mission of the army and the other security services allows us to anticipate an unprecedented strengthening of measures to maintain public order and provide more security for the activities of political parties and various other organizations, as well as the electoral processes. after the social dialogue involving employers, unions and the government, and a number of bold measures aimed at youth and workers of all categories a milestone will be reached with the holding of free legislative elections, pluralist and transparent, in the very near future. togo will then have satisfied all the commitments made to the european union on 14 april 2004 in brussels. in an attempt to give every opportunity for national harmony, implement the conclusions of the political dialogue and establish sustainable democracy, a broad-based government of national unity was established on 20 september 2006. all sections of the togolese people, in their political, social and regional diversity, are represented in it. all the changes under way in togolese society were made possible by the support of the international community, the maturity of the people of togo and, of course, the sense of compromise of the political class. we are very grateful to all our international partners who assisted us during this process of peacebuilding in our country. our appreciation goes in particular to the economic community of west african states (ecowas), the african union, the european 06-53609 24 union, the international organization of la francophonie, france, germany, the united states of america and all african heads of state, who have always been very attentive to what we have had to say. i wish also, and very particularly, to express to the facilitator, mr. blaise compaore, president of burkina faso, the gratitude of our entire government and people for his critical role in the conclusion and signing of the comprehensive political agreement. consolidating peace in togo and the success of our democratization process remain closely linked to the stability of the regional and international environment. therefore, togo continues to be concerned about the situation in cote divoire. given the many preconditions for organizing elections in that neighbouring country, there must be concern, from any point of view, about the fulfilment of the mission for which the united nations is responsible. we hope that the resolution of those preconditions will permit the holding of free and democratic elections leading cote divoire to sustainable peace. similarly, with regard to the region of darfur and somalia, in the absence of a much more vigorous voluntary mobilization by the international community to end the cycle of violence and the tragedy of the peoples concerned, peace will not come soon to that part of africa. in other parts of the world, the continuing developments in both iraq and the middle east are a major source of concern for the government of togo. togo firmly believes it is high time that the people of iraq were reconciled and that the international community provided all the necessary support for their government to help it complete the reconciliation process. it should be emphasized that the countries of the subregion have an important role to play in the quest for peace in iraq. the tragedy that unfolded in lebanon weighs on our conscience. togo welcomes the security councils adoption of resolution 1701 (2006), whose effective implementation will permit the return of peace to the country. at the heart of the middle east conflict is the thorny question of palestine. sustainable peace in the region requires an end to the continuous cycle of violence and a climate of confidence, which would make possible talks to create a palestinian state alongside the state of israel, the two of them coexisting within secure and internationally recognized borders. while the resolution of crises and conflicts remains at the heart of our concerns, everything must be done to consolidate peace in countries emerging from conflicts, or countries which, after great efforts, have succeeded in their democratization process. therefore, the peacebuilding commission must play a vital role in african countries emerging from conflicts. we are pleased that it is already considering the situation in burundi and sierra leone. it must also help liberia to strengthen its regained peace and make sure that guinea-bissau does not sink into violence. similarly, while we welcome the holding of legislative and presidential elections in the democratic republic of the congo, togo calls on the international community to pay sustained attention to that country so as to assist it until its still fragile process is completed. disarmament efforts by the international community are still far from producing the desired results. on the korean peninsula the nuclear question is still unresolved, and there is a need for a strengthening of mutual confidence among the states concerned. therefore, my country firmly supports every effort to resolve the regions security questions peacefully. we believe also that the question of the nuclear programme of the islamic republic of iran cannot be resolved without negotiations between the interested parties, and we call on them to create conditions conducive to such talks. it would not be wise to stop the country, by whatever means, developing a nuclear programme, essentially peaceful, for its fundamental research needs and the socio- economic development of its population. with respect to small arms and light weapons, togo regrets that the international community was unable to successfully conclude the july 2006 new york united nations conference to review progress made in the implementation of the programme of action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects, adopted in 2001. the failure of that conference is not encouraging for regional and subregional initiatives. at the same time, the adoption in june this year of the ecowas convention on small arms and light weapons, their ammunition and other related materials is very much part of strengthening confidence-building measures among states in the subregion. it is to be hoped that at this 25 06-53609 session the general assembly will seriously examine the question of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, which are a destabilizing factor for african states in particular, and a threat to the peace and security of people in general. i should also like to emphasize the importance of our collective responsibility to counter terrorism and human rights violations. the reply of the international community to terrorism should be appropriate and should correspond to the expectations of peoples who only wish to live in a world free from fear. the general assemblys adoption of the global counter-terrorism strategy is to be welcomed. we hope that the human rights council will contribute to strengthening the capacity of states to promote and protect human rights by developing and implementing appropriate strategies and programmes. accordingly, on 10 july the government concluded an agreement on establishing an office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights in togo. the current state of the world characterized by a considerable increase in united nations membership, from 51 member states in 1945 to 192 in 2006, the emergence of new powers, the persistence of certain conflicts and especially the frequent paralysis in the security council requires that the united nations be reformed as soon as possible, as the september 2005 world summit recommended. while the objective of reform is to make the organization more effective and efficient, we must not lose sight of the fact that a central, urgent factor is security council reform. if that is not included, the reform will be unfinished business. decisions related to economic development and the elimination of poverty adopted by the september 2005 world summit have rekindled hope about the will of the rich industrialized countries to assist the countries of the south to promote sustainable development for their peoples. implementation of the commitments made would permit achievement of the goals. therefore, the countries of the south ask the countries of the north to commit themselves not only to keep their promises to make a genuine contribution to reducing poverty by 50 per cent by 2015, but finally to eradicate it. as the assembly is well aware, the support of the rich industrialized countries will enable us to consolidate the efforts that the countries of the south continue to make, efforts which have allowed us to improve macroeconomic management by tackling inflation and consolidating a balanced budget. however, the global incidence of extreme poverty has not declined, especially in the less developed countries, where combating poverty is still a very difficult task. the situation that i have just described is exacerbated by factors that the developing countries have not been able to master. they include, to mention just a few: the external debt, deterioration in the terms of trade, the weakness of official development assistance, and environmental degradation. moreover, the hiv/aids pandemic presents a major challenge to growth and economic development. major conferences organized under united nations auspices are slow to yield results. the status review of the millennium development goals, held in september 2005, and the failure of the doha round and the midterm review of the brussels programme of action for least developed countries for the decade 2001-2010, held on 18 and 19 september, have shown that there are still barriers to implementing the commitments made. it is therefore regrettable that development partners have not always honoured their official development commitments to the least developed countries. nevertheless, promises made recently, in particular by the g-8 summit in 2005, regarding an increase in assistance and debt relief, have given us reason for some optimism. additionally, access to markets and the gradual elimination of agricultural subsidies by all countries simultaneously, on dates set by the world trade organization, would contribute to the development of poor countries, since agriculture is the basis of the existence of hundreds of millions of people in the least developed countries. for togo it is essential that progress be made in resolving questions relating to cotton, in particular, questions that remain vital for many developing countries. my country welcomes the high-level dialogue on international migration and development, held on 14 and 15 september, during which the general assembly dealt with the multiple aspects of international migration. we must do more in-depth thinking on ways to stem the tide of the massive and hazardous exodus to northern countries. an arsenal of repressive measures alone will not resolve a situation that is becoming more and more like a scourge. in conclusion, i emphasize that if we are faithful to our common destiny and our worldwide partnership 06-53609 26 based on solidarity we can realize the millennium development goals. therefore, the countries of both the north

ZAF,62,2007,"let me begin by adding my voice to the many salutations directed to mr. ban ki-moon on being elected as the secretary-general of the united nations. i wish him a fruitful tenure of office, trusting that through his work the poor of the world will have good reason to increase their confidence in this organization of the nations of the world. again, i reiterate the many thanks to her excellency ms. haya rashed al khalifa, for the good work she did as the president of the general assembly at its sixty-first session. equally, my congratulations go to mr. srgjan kerim on his election as the president of the general assembly at its sixty-second session. we meet here today, under the theme of responding to climate change, at this session, which marks the half-way point in the freely agreed period during which the nations of the world committed themselves to work, individually and collectively, to achieve the millennium development goals (mdgs). billions of the people of the world know as a matter of fact that the consequences of climate change be it droughts, floods or unpredictable and extreme weather patterns undermine our common efforts to achieve the mdgs. today, we all understand that the costs of doing nothing about climate change far outweigh those of taking concrete measures to address this challenge. it is clear that delaying action on this matter of climate change will hit poor countries and communities hardest. yet the pace of climate change negotiations is out of step with the urgency indicated by science. i would therefore urge that we collectively aim for a significant advance in the multilateral negotiations when our negotiators meet in bali in december this year. together, we must ensure that we build a fair, effective, flexible and inclusive climate regime under the united nations framework convention on climate change and its kyoto protocol, and we must agree to this as a matter of urgency. though we have different responsibilities, and developed countries clearly have an obligation to take the lead, we all have a common duty to do more and act within our respective capabilities and in accordance with our national circumstances. the world summit on sustainable development correctly reaffirmed sustainable development as a central element of the global action against poverty and the protection of the environment and identified important linkages between poverty, the environment and the use of natural resources. these linkages are real to billions of the poor; the combination of their empty stomachs, their degraded environment and their exploited natural resources, for which they benefit nothing, defines hopelessness and a heart-wrenching existence. many of these wretched of the earth know from their bitter experience how their resource-rich areas were transformed into arid, uninhabitable and desolate areas forcing migration to better-endowed regions, thus exacerbating conflicts and the struggle for scarce resources. gathered here as representatives of the peoples of the world, we know very well that climate change, poverty and underdevelopment are not acts of god but human-made. clearly, the starting point for a future climate regime must be equity. a core balance between sustainable development and climate imperatives will have to be the basis of any agreement on a strengthened climate regime. any deal on fair use of the ecological space will have to be balanced by a deal giving all countries a fair chance in the development space. under the aegis of the united nations, but also within our regional bodies, we have adopted many programmes and declarations, with clear implementation targets aimed at addressing the challenges of climate change, poverty and underdevelopment. as this conclave knows very well, the many lofty agreements include, among others, those adopted at the rio earth summit, the copenhagen social summit, the millennium summit, the world summit on sustainable development and the monterrey international conference on financing for development. at all these summits and others, we have adopted declarations using moving and solemn words that express our profound understanding of the gravity of the challenges facing the modern world and have unequivocally committed ourselves to defeating any and all of the miserable and dehumanizing conditions facing large parts of humanity. indeed, this collective asserted, in paragraph 11 of the millennium declaration (resolution 55/2): we will spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty. ... we are committed to making the right to development a reality for everyone and to freeing the entire human race from want. yet the poor, whose hopes have been raised many times as we have made declaration after declaration against poverty and underdevelopment and as we are doing now on climate change can be forgiven for thinking that this important global leadership often sounds like an empty vessel. that this collective is able to express, always eloquently, the dire circumstances characterizing poverty is without doubt. however, this organization, which should pride itself on visible actions and results in the fight against climate change and poverty, finds it difficult to demonstrate decisive progress in that regard. the reasons for that are not hard to find. although the concepts of freedom, justice and equality are universal and fully embraced by the united nations, this global organization has not itself transformed and designed necessary institutions of governance that are consistent with the noble ideals that drive modern democratic societies. because the nations of the world are defined by the dominant and the dominated, the dominant have always become the decision-makers in the important global forums, including at this seat of global governance. accordingly, the skewed distribution of world power political, economic, military, technological and social replicates itself in multilateral institutions, much to the disadvantage of the majority of the poor people of the world. indeed, even as we agree on the important programmes that should bring a better life to the billions of poor, the rich and the powerful have consistently sought to ensure that, whatever happens, the existing power relations are not altered and therefore that the status quo remains. the results of that situation are that the united nations can and does correctly identify problems and appropriate solutions necessary for making the world a better place for all of humanity. naturally, the dominant and the powerful very often respond positively to agreed programmes if these would advance their own narrow interests. at the same time, the poor will continue to strive for improvement of their wretched conditions. they therefore see the united nations as a natural instrument for helping to accelerate the process of change for the better. hence, they correctly see implementation of all united nations programmes as being central to the efforts relating to climate change and the struggle against poverty and underdevelopment. yet the cold reality is that it will be difficult for the united nations, in its present form, to fully implement its own decisions and therefore to help the poor to swiftly achieve the millennium development goals (mdgs). indeed, until the ideals of freedom, justice and equality characterize this premier world body itself, the dominant will forever dictate to the dominated, and the interests of the dominated which are those of the majority of humanity will be deferred in perpetuity. thus, noble statements will continue to be uttered on all matters facing the majority of the people of the world, such as the need to successfully conclude the doha development round, while little is done to implement the many critical agreements necessary to pull the poor out of the morass of poverty and underdevelopment. we in my own country are of the firm belief that we will achieve the mdgs. having emerged from more than three centuries of colonialism and apartheid, we inherited two interlinked economies, which we characterize as the first and second economies. the two economies one developed and globally connected and the other localized and informal display many features of a global system of apartheid. as south africans, we have sought to strengthen the first economy and to use it as a base for the transfer of resources to strengthen and modernize the second economy, and thus embark on the process of changing the lives of those who subsist in the second economy. indeed, without the requisite resource transfers, it will not be possible to achieve the mdgs, because our second economy cannot on its own generate the resources needed to bring a better life to millions of poor south africans. i mention this because, as we all accept, central to the global attainment of the mdgs is the critical matter of resource transfers from the rich countries of the north to the poor countries of the south. many developing countries especially those of my own continent, africa do not have the material base from which to address and attain the mdgs on their own. accordingly, there is an urgent need for massive resource transfers through development assistance, investment, trade, technology transfers and human resource development to these poor countries if we are to achieve the mdgs and successfully adapt to the devastating impacts of climate change. if we do not succeed in building a climate change regime that balances adaptation and mitigation, underpinned by the transfer of technology and financial resources, we will place an unmanageable burden on future generations. in that regard, given africas specific and dire challenges, we believe it is important to enter into a partnership with africa using the african unions programme the new partnership for africas development (nepad), which the assembly has adopted, so that the measures that the continent has undertaken, with limited resources, for the regeneration of all the african countries can be strengthened by support from the international community, guided by the programmes of the united nations. as history teaches us, it was because of the massive resource transfers in the aftermath of the second world war that western europe recovered and was set on its development path. a similar intervention helped to put a number of asian countries on their own development trajectory. the question we should ask is, why is there an absence of the same resolve to assist poor nations today? the global village to which we constantly refer should encourage us to expand human solidarity. thus, we would build a durable bridge over the river dividing our common global village and regrettably ensuring that one human being lives a fulfilling life while another experiences a miserable existence. representing the citizens of the world, we have set for ourselves programmes requiring that all of us work together to create better living conditions for humanity and ensure that we achieve that which is necessary for our mutual prosperity. together, rich and poor, developed and developing, north and south, we can and must truly hold hands and address the challenges of climate change and sustainable development, work together to defeat poverty and underdevelopment and ensure that every human being is saved from the indecencies and humiliations that are inseparable from poverty. but to do that, we need first and foremost to implement the decisions that we have adopted freely in this eminent house of the representatives of the global community. and so, let our actions speak louder than our words.",South Africa,Africa,88.7172470092773,4.446670055389404,1862.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.611170784103115
CMR,62,2007,"let me first of all say that i am happy to see the former yugoslav republic of macedonia, represented by ambassador kerim, presiding over the general assembly at its sixty-second session. my country extends to him wishes for the greatest success in accomplishing his mission. we would like to assure him of our full cooperation. please also allow me to pay tribute to ms. haya rashed al-khalifa of the kingdom of bahrain for the skill with which she conducted the work of the sixty-first session. i would also like to welcome the presence among us of mr. ban ki-moon, secretary-general of the united nations. i congratulate him on his accession to this post of the highest prestige in our organization. the vast experience and the qualities of a diplomat that he is known for are a guarantee of success in this lofty function. i am convinced that he will be able to work for the benefit of our organization in continuing the efforts of his predecessor, mr. kofi annan, to whom i would like once again to pay tribute. the general debate in this assembly is a special moment in international life. indeed, it is an opportunity every year for heads of member states to take stock of the worlds affairs, to exchange views in this regard and to reflect the aspirations of their nations. the sixty-second session of the general assembly opens this year again in a rather troubled international context. at the dawn of the twenty-first century, the challenges facing humanity are more pressing and more complex with each passing day, giving rise alternatively to hope and fears. the first of these challenges to which i would like to refer here today has to do with peace and security. international events today highlight even more than before the paramount need to breathe new life into efforts for disarmament and non-proliferation. nuclear proliferation is a threat, not only to international peace and security but also to the very survival of humankind. attempts by terrorist organizations to acquire weapons of mass destruction are also indicative of the reality of this threat. terrorism, indeed, is a particularly great danger to the international community, a threat that we can only face through concerted and resolute global action. it is because of this conviction that cameroon has in the past year contributed to the adoption by the general assembly of the global counter-terrorism strategy. once again, i would like to salute this historic accomplishment. for the first time, member states have decided to take up concrete political, operational and legal measures to coordinate their fight against terrorism. they have committed themselves to strengthening their capacity to react, as well as the capability of the united nations in this regard. they have agreed to address situations that could lead to the extension of this scourge. today, the problem is to apply this fundamental text, both in letter and spirit. my country would like to reaffirm its availability and its determination in terms of taking on commitments in this work. in many regions around the world, peace and security continue to be seriously threatened. for years now, the unrest in the middle east has been a serious threat to international peace and security. the evolution of the israeli-palestinian conflict causes deep concern. it is paramount that israel and the palestinian authority resume a constructive dialogue. that is the only way, in the opinion of my country, to move forward toward a settlement. cameroon is convinced that only the efforts of all concerned parties, supported by the great powers and based on the principle of two states israel and palestine coexisting in peace and security, will make it possible to reach a definitive, fair and just settlement to this conflict. in lebanon, as in iraq, reconciliation among the various communities of these countries is the only hope for a sustainable stability. in africa, in spite of initiatives undertaken by the international community, there remain a number of hotbeds of tension. please allow me to highlight some of these. the crisis in cote divoire seems to be reaching a turning point. we are convinced that, with the firm and sincere commitment of all parties and the support of the international community, this fraternal country will have definitively turned a particularly painful page in its history. the people of cote divoire, we are sure, will be able to persevere in their choice of peace and national reconciliation. it is extremely important that they work together in good faith for a full and rapid implementation of the ouagadougou peace agreement. the situation in somalia continues to threaten peace and security in the region. cameroon is deeply concerned by acts of violence in somalia. we would like to congratulate the mission of the african union for the support that it has extended to the transitional federal institutions. we are sure that the speedy deployment of the envisaged united nations force will definitely have a positive effect on the stability in that country and on the security of the population. the human toll of the darfur crisis causes profound concern. it seems to us of paramount importance that all efforts be undertaken to break the tragic cycle of violence in that region. the effects of the crisis have already been deeply felt by neighbouring states and threaten to extend further. it should be understood that cameroon welcomes the announcement of the deployment of the hybrid united nations-african union peacekeeping operation in darfur. i am convinced that this operation will make it possible to stabilize the situation in the area and save innocent lives. my country welcomes the fact that the government of sudan has unconditionally accepted the deployment of this mission. in our opinion, this is a decisive stage in the resolution of the crisis. at the same time, cameroon believes it is very important to continue efforts to address the causes of the conflict, by relaunching the political process and by implementing a real programme of development in the region, specifically by ensuring access to water resources. cameroon follows with close attention the developments in the situation in chad and the central african republic. those fraternal countries with which we have long common borders have, for a number of years, been facing instability fomented by various insurgent groups. that situation poses a serious threat to peace and stability in those countries and to the security and well-being of their populations and triggers a true humanitarian tragedy in the region. it also causes cross-border insecurity that affects other countries in the region, including cameroon. for that reason, my country resolutely supports the upcoming deployment of a multidimensional presence of the united nations and the european union on the borders of chad, the central african republic and the sudan. i wish to reiterate from this rostrum that my country is ready to cooperate fully with the united nations in the implementation of that operation. with regard to the democratic republic of the congo we welcome the progress accomplished towards peace in terms of establishing democratic institutions in that country. the situation in the eastern part of the country continues to be a source of concern to the international community. it seems to us that seeking a solution to the crisis of the two kivus should be based first and foremost on political and diplomatic methods corresponding to the problem at hand. the challenges we must face in terms of peace and security are considerable. however, they must not eclipse in our minds the equally significant challenges confronting us in other areas. it seems crucial to me that every necessary effort be exerted to reach the millennium development goals. this year we are reaching the midpoint of the timetable we have established for ourselves in that regard. it is very important that states live up to the commitments made, to the extent possible. the reduction in official development assistance in 2006 underlines the need for donors to try to increase the level of their aid so that the goals set for 2010 and 2015 may be reached. furthermore, i wish again to state the hope that the negotiations of the doha round are completed on schedule and ensure that the interests of the countries of the south are protected and that the globalization of trade retains its significance. i cannot remain silent about the terrible experience of thousands of young people from africa who, for a number of years now, have set forth at risk to their lives in their attempts to reach europe in their eyes the new promised land. that migration keeps increasing and is of course attributable to the difference in the level of development between the north and the south. in that regard, the countries of origin, the countries of transit and the receiving countries must intervene to seek humane solutions that take into account the underlying causes of that phenomenon. it is indeed clear that neither controls nor repatriation will offer an adequate or sustainable response to the problem. the issue of climate change is becoming one of the most important and most urgent issues of our time, as has been recognized by all, and it is urgent that we act. the destinies of future generations depend on that. in that context i wish to congratulate the secretary- general for his initiative in convening the high-level event on climate change, which has just been concluded here. the holding of negotiations in december 2007 in bali, indonesia, on the united nations framework convention on climate change and on the post-kyoto regime should also be a focus of our attention. furthermore, we welcome the intention of the tunisian government to organize from 18 to 20 november 2007, an international conference on the effects of climate change and strategies for adaptation on the african continent and in the mediterranean region. in that domain we should try to reach a global agreement that would be part of the united nations framework convention process and which would tackle the matter of climate change in all its aspects. the challenges we have just discussed can only be taken up on a global scale. the united nations should be at the forefront of that struggle and for that purpose needs the active cooperation of all its members, particularly the great powers. but it should also constantly adapt itself to the changing realities of our time so as to be in a position to efficiently fulfil its mission. accordingly, cameroon attaches the greatest importance to the reform of the united nations. it supports a progressive, gradual reform of the current united nations system which would take into account the changing balances in the world in recent years and the emergence of many new states. it is our intention to continue to cooperate with other member states for a renewed united nations, a model of modern and effective governance, in its participation in world affairs.",Cameroon,Africa,70.6799392700195,2.878159999847412,1818.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.6501650165016502
TUN,62,2007,"at the outset, i would like to express to his excellency mr. srgjan kerim and to his friendly country our most sincere congratulations on his election as president of the general assembly at its sixty-second session. we are confident that under his skilful and effective leadership, our deliberations will be successful. i wish also to extend to our sister, her excellency ms. sheikha haya rashed al-khalifa, our deep thanks and appreciation for her valuable efforts as president of the assembly at its previous session towards the realization of the millennium development goals and towards enhancing dialogue among all members of the international community and reviving the security council reform process. i wish also to express our appreciation to secretary-general ban ki-moon for his endeavours and his determination to reform the functioning of the organization. we wish him every success. signs of new dynamism in the united nations reform process reflect a true desire to improve the organizations work so as to bring it in line with the requirements of the new world realities and with new concepts arising from the profound and speedy transformations the world has experienced in recent decades. in our view, giving effect to that desire requires new working frameworks and mechanisms to reinforce the underpinnings of international peace and security and enable us to achieve collective solutions to the common challenges facing the international community. we should be inspired in that endeavour by a new vision that lays the foundation for a comprehensive, effective and solidarity-based global partnership among the members of the international community, on the basis of constructive dialogue among peoples, cultures, civilizations and religions. on the basis of that conviction, tunisia has launched international initiatives with political, humanitarian and social dimensions. some of these initiatives were adopted by the united nations, such as the establishment of the world solidarity fund. we look forward to increased efforts by the international community to operationalize the fund. since the early 1990s, tunisia has been in the forefront of countries drawing attention to the dangers of terrorism and its negative impact on world security and stability. today, tunisia renews its call for an international conference, under united nations auspices, in order to formulate an international code of conduct for combating terrorism, by which all parties would abide. convinced of the significant role that dialogue among civilizations plays in obviating the dangers of extremism and intolerance, tunisia has consistently endeavoured to be the world capital of dialogue among civilizations, by hosting several regional and international conferences and seminars. it has also taken initiatives in this field, such as the publication of the carthage charter for tolerance in 1995, the appeal by president zine el abidine ben ali for a pedagogy of tolerance, the 2001 tunis declaration on dialogue among civilizations, and the establishment, in the university of tunis, of the ben ali chair for dialogue among civilizations and religions. we take note with satisfaction of the focus on the theme of climate change during the current sessions general debate, in view of the fact that environmental issues are a basic pillar of sustainable development and one of the major elements of the millennium development goals one that has an impact on international peace and security. tunisia believes that climate change poses a common threat to all states of the world without exception. this has prompted tunisia to host, next november, an international ministerial workshop to discuss climate change in africa and the mediterranean region, as a contribution to increasing and deepening awareness of the importance of this issue and to enriching regional dialogue on it. the international community and all its members must devote more attention to the environment and to finding urgent and effective collective solutions to environmental issues in certain regions of the world notably in africa, which suffers most from the climate change that is threatening the continents aspirations to development and to the achievement of the millennium development goals. the fact that several important international political problems remain unsolved continues to be a source of concern for us. today, tunisia reaffirms that it upholds the values of peace and justice and the principles of international legitimacy, and that it is prepared to contribute to the dissemination and promotion of the values of tolerance, moderation and mutual respect among nations and peoples. in our view, that should help consolidate a constructive dialogue among civilizations and establish international cooperation and a solidarity-based development partnership that will help eliminate the causes of tension and conflict worldwide. on this occasion, we reaffirm our principled and constant support for the palestinian people in their struggle for their just cause. we urge the international community, in particular the influential parties and the quartet, to intensify their efforts aimed at reviving the peace process, on the basis of united nations resolutions and the relevant arab and international terms of reference, inter alia, the arab peace initiative, with a view to finding a just and comprehensive solution that would guarantee the restoration of the palestinians legitimate rights, foremost among which is the establishment of their own independent state. we welcome the initiative taken by president bush and certain international influential parties to revive the peace process. in this context, we wish to stress the importance of convening an international peace conference that should yield concrete proposals for achieving a lasting and comprehensive peace in the middle east and lead to the restitution of all occupied arab territories and guarantee security and stability to all the countries and peoples of the region. by the same token, we call for concerted regional and international efforts to help the brotherly iraqi people to restore the deteriorating security, economic and humanitarian situation in their country, through the achievement of a consensual political settlement among all its segments and factions that preserves the unity and sovereignty of iraq. as far as the situation in lebanon is concerned, we urge all lebanese parties to favour dialogue as the sole way to prevent the scourge of dissension among the lebanese people and to restore confidence and reconciliation among them. since 7 november 1987, tunisia, under the leadership of president zine el abidine ben ali, has succeeded in making pioneer achievements and gains in different fields. this has been made possible thanks to comprehensive reforms that allowed tunisia to consolidate the rule of law and institutions, as well as public freedoms, and to disseminate, in theory and practice, the culture of human rights, thus enhancing the democratic structure of the country and paving the way for contributions by all components of civil society to define national orientations and choices for the future. the reform process implemented in tunisia has allowed the achievement of numerous millennium development goals, which has translated into better living standards for tunisians and well-being for all segments of tunisian society. this reflects the correctness of development choices made by tunisia, which has also allowed it to hold an advanced position among countries with the highest level of human development. on many occasions, tunisia has stated its conviction of the need for building international cooperation and partnerships based on a comprehensive approach aimed at achieving development for all and laying the foundations for constructive relations among countries of the north and the south. in this context, president zine el abidine ben ali called from this rostrum in 1989 for the adoption of a charter of peace and progress between the countries of the north and the south. the international community is called upon to exert more efforts to enable all the peoples of the world, particularly the least developed countries, to benefit from the digital revolution and to acquire knowledge. this will require operationalizing and implementing the recommendations and resolutions made by international conferences in our country in november 2005 to contribute to the building of a global, more equitable and solidarity-based information society. the integration of tunisia in its regional and international environment is one of the priorities of its foreign policy, which endeavours to enhance political relations with brotherly and friendly nations as well with regional and international organizations. tunisia looks forward to the broadening and diversification of the scope of its cooperation with all its partners in order to bring it to the level of an efficient partnership based on mutual respect and common interest. hence, tunisia is constantly striving, with its brotherly maghrebian countries, to complete the formation of the maghreb arab union and to consolidate its structures and institutions in order to reinforce integration and complementarity among the peoples of the region. tunisia has equally sought to enhance the effectiveness of arab common action. it seeks to upgrade its interaction with the changes and challenges confronting the region and to further the process of reform and modernization in this field, in conformity with the decisions and recommendations of the tunis summit, the algiers summit and the riyadh summit. on the other hand, tunisia, being a member of arab committees entrusted with palestinian, lebanese and other issues, is participating effectively in the work of those committees for the benefit of arab causes. as far as africa is concerned, tunisia has enhanced its relations with african countries and has strengthened cooperation with them. it has made active efforts to contribute effectively to the process of building the structures and institutions of the african union and to the consolidation of the fundamentals of peace, security and stability in the continent and opening promising new horizons for development in order to further enhance integration among its peoples. in view of the strategic importance of its relations with the european union, tunisia has been constantly seeking to advance those ties and to broaden their scope, so as to cover all fields of cooperation with the aim of building a solidarity-based partnership with european union countries based on mutual respect and common interest. tunisia also endeavours to strengthen the euro-mediterranean cooperation process. in this connection, tunisia has welcomed the initiative launched by president nicolas sarkozy of france for establishing a mediterranean union. tunisia has further expressed its readiness to contribute to and participate in shaping the content of such a union and in defining its objectives. since the establishment of the united nations, tunisia has expressed constant faith in the noble principles and purposes of the organization. it has always been committed to lending its support to efforts aimed at creating favourable conditions for appropriate collective responses to global common challenges and for solving the various problems that are a source of concern to the world, as well as establishing solidarity- based cooperation and partnership among all components of the international community. from this perspective, tunisia, which will assume chairmanship of the next session of the conference on disarmament, is determined to work, in coordination with member states, for the achievement of tangible progress regarding issues on the agenda of the conference. in so doing, tunisia will seek to enhance constructive and positive dialogue on those issues in order to achieve the objectives of the conference and to contribute to the consolidation of peace and security in the world and to the dissemination of a global culture of peace, thus consecrating the noble values and principles for which our organization has been created.",Tunisia,Africa,77.1903991699219,6.46451997756958,1865.0,7.0,0.0,7.0,3.7533512064343166
BFA,62,2007,"i should like at the outset to express our sincere congratulations to his excellency mr. srgjan kerim on his election to the presidency of the general assembly at its sixty-second session. i am convinced that, thanks to his skill as an experienced diplomat, he will ably carry out his mandate. he can count on the cooperation of the delegation of burkina faso. i should also like to express our deep gratitude to his predecessor, her excellency sheikha haya rashed al-khalifa, for the ability with which she led the work of the sixty-first session. i would like, finally, to pay tribute to the secretary-general, ban ki-moon, who has shown, in the less than a year that he has been at the head of this organization, his full-fledged commitment to peace and development and his firm determination to pursue the ambitious work of modernizing the united nations bequeathed to him by his predecessor, mr. kofi annan. as i speak to this assembly, burkina faso has had floods this year, which have bereaved many families in all regions of the country. the dozens of death, the thousands of homeless people and displaced persons, the food crisis and the subsequent epidemics have implications above and beyond the statistics the heavy price that a country, such as burkina faso, pays for global warming and all other phenomenon linked to climate change. it is my hope that the conclusions of the important summit on climate change held here on 24 september will promote the adoption of appropriate and urgent measures that will shield our populations from this type of scourge. all types of tension are shaking the world and, in particular, the african continent, which gives us reasons to welcome the role played by our organization in the search for and strengthening of peace and peacebuilding. burkina faso, which is the chair of the economic community of west african states (ecowas), is mindful that no sustainable development can be contemplated without an environment of peace and stability and has made conflict resolution a key thrust of its diplomacy. therefore, president compaore has made a resolute commitment as facilitator to search for solutions to the crises that have affected the fraternal and neighbouring countries of togo and cote divoire. the inter-togolese dialogue, which led in august 2006 to the signing in lome of a comprehensive political agreement. the agreement is bearing fruit, which pleases all those concerned. the latest session of the follow-up committee, which was held in ouagadougou in august 2007, noted the conclusion of the electoral roll revision process and the setting of a date for legislative elections on 14 october 2007. prospects are encouraging in togo and, on behalf of president compaore, facilitator of the inter-togolese dialogue, i can confirm the sincere will and the real commitment of the people and the political class of togo to get their country out of this crisis and to create the best conditions conducive to reconstruction, growth and development. and, in thanking the international community for their assistance, i would call on them to pursue their action for institutional reforms, peacebuilding and economic development in togo. in the republic of cote divoire, thanks to the ouagadougou political accord, signed on 4 march 2007 by president gbagbo and the secretary-general of the forces nouvelles guillaume soro, the end of hostilities is now a reality. and so we should commend and encourage them to persevere to a final peace in cote divoire. the facilitator of the direct dialogue in the ivorian crisis, president compaore, who is president of the conference of heads of state and government of ecowas at this time, is please to see all of the political class and the entire population of cote divoire joining in the ouagadougou accord. this accord translates the will of the parties to proceed with identifying people for an electoral enumeration and to organize a free, open and transparent presidential election. the security council, in its resolution 1765 (2007), has endorsed this accord. i would like to express our appreciation to the united nations, which has supported burkina faso in its efforts to establish peace and security, particularly in west africa. in deciding to be a candidate for a non- permanent seat on the security council, for the period of 2008-2009, burkina faso hopes to make its contribution to the triumph of a world of justice and peace over the current world, where exclusion, intolerance and frustrations generate violent acts of despair. at this time, i would like to reiterate our thanks to the member states of the ecowas and the african union (au) who decided to make the candidacy of burkina faso an african candidacy. our hope is that all members of this organization will give us their trust. we will be worthy of it. burkina faso remains concerned by situations of tension and conflict in africa and throughout the world. we welcome the decision of the security council to deploy a hybrid united nations-african union force in darfur (unamis). burkina faso has decided to participate in it, as we have done in a number of other theatres of operation. i would call upon the international community to give peace a chance in the sudan by giving this hybrid force the logistical and financial resources necessary for accomplishing their mission. as for the protagonists, they will have to do everything they can to make the upcoming talks an important milestone in the process of national reconciliation and in bringing peace to the country. we also think about the persistence of conflicts in somalia and between ethiopia and eritrea. the saharan zone, which includes the north of mali and niger, has also been hit by armed conflict. burkina faso has expressed its solidarity to those two neighbouring countries and hopes that durable solutions will allow for peace to be re-established and will allow for the promotion of socio-economic development. we are pleased about the political developments in sierra leone, a country which has just had great success in organizing free, democratic and transparent general elections. this is the most recent illustration that democracy and good governance are gradually taking root in africa. throughout the continent, this principle of good governance is part of the political agendas. we also congratulate the moroccan government for having initiated direct talks with the polisario front on the future of the western sahara. by this direct dialogue the two parties are, together, proving their ability to look for a mutually beneficial political solution. we would strongly encourage them to do so, convinced as we have always been that only a negotiated, political solution will put an end to this conflict. because it is at the heart of any lasting peace in the region and throughout the world, the settlement of the israeli-palestinian conflict must remain an absolute priority for our organization. in this respect, it has been established that the only solution is the creation of a palestinian state that is viable with secure and internationally recognized borders alongside a state of israel that is also certain of its security. and this is now where all efforts should be focused. in welcoming the existence of nuclear-weapon- free zones, burkina faso is also calling for a responsible, just and equitable approach to the so- called nuclear crises. my delegation is very much concerned by the proliferation and the trafficking of small arms and light weapons, which for the victims are truly weapons of mass destruction. in west africa, the phenomenon is particularly disturbing and its eradication requires sustained cooperation among states, as well as significant support on the part of the international community. burkina faso, which is the chair of ecowas, has decided to make a priority of this issue. the west african region is also in the process of becoming a key centre of drug trafficking. that situation requires urgent and appropriate action on our part, since it is likely to destabilize states, particularly by disrupting their economies and increasing the level of organized crime and corruption. therefore, we call for solidarity and support from the international community to help us eradicate this scourge as swiftly as possible. those worrisome issues will certainly be on the agenda of the conference on peace and security in west africa and the role of the joint european union-africa strategy which my country will host in november 2007. a joint initiative of the republic of austria and burkina faso, that important meeting will be an opportunity to identify the underlying causes of conflict and to formulate solutions capable of ensuring the sustainable development of countries in the subregion. the current situation in many countries reminds us of the cruel reality of terrorism, which remains among the most pernicious of challenges and thus the most difficult to overcome. we must therefore demonstrate greater solidarity to contain it. in particular, we call for diligent implementation of the united nations global counter-terrorism strategy and, in that connection, effective international cooperation to strengthen the current legal arsenal and the conclusion of a comprehensive convention as soon as possible. by working for sustainable peace, we offer our states the best guarantee for their economic development. nevertheless, the current international economic reality, which is characterized by globalization and excessive liberalization, continues to batter economies such as that of burkina faso. what is more, these fragile economies must contend with unfair trade rules. several years ago, president blaise compaore, by launching his crusade against subsidies for northern cotton growers a crusade that was also carried out on behalf of his peers in benin, mali and chad sought to put an end to one of the most cynical practices of international trade. we hope to see the conclusion of the doha round of negotiations, which will place development at the heart of international trade. millions of men, women and children particularly in africa are waiting to benefit from the positive impact of international trade in the hope that it will contribute to their development and to the improvement of their living conditions. for them, poverty and misery are not statistics or assessments, let alone projections. they are the mother who, because there is no drinking water or no health facility within a distance of 10 kilometres, sees the baby whom she bore with difficulty die in her arms; they are the child who is eager for knowledge but who will never go to school; they are the father who sees his only son confront the wrath of the sea and jeopardize his life in search of a supposedly better life on some shore. those are the daily tragedies to which all of us here can attest. we have the means to act. we must act quickly. we must act now. for a number of years, we have engaged the united nations in a process of qualitative change to equip it with the means to deal with the demands of the modern world and to be able to effectively fulfil the aspirations of peoples. however, while the achievements are considerable, the task remains vast and the expectations pressing. thus, we must demonstrate the will and the discernment to give the organization viable structures and adequate means. burkina faso hopes that, at the end of this process, the historical wrongs committed against africa and other parts of the world will be corrected, particularly at the level of the security council. we also deplore the ongoing injustice committed against the republic of china on taiwan, whose legitimate aspiration to participate fully in world affairs has been denied. nevertheless, that country is a good example of successful democracy and social and economic development. by depriving 25 million men and women of the right to make their contribution to the realization of united nations principles and objectives, our organization is also depriving itself of its own quest for modernity and universality. therefore, it is a new united nations, open to all, that burkina faso earnestly calls for. burkina faso reaffirms its faith in multilateralism and in the role of the united nations as an irreplaceable instrument for peace, development and the promotion of dialogue among peoples, which it is our historic duty to preserve and strengthen.",Burkina Faso,Africa,28.2936592102051,4.079830169677734,2023.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.9886307464162134
ZMB,62,2007,"allow me at the outset to convey my warm congratulations to mr. srgjan kerim on his election to the presidency of the general assembly at its sixty-second session. my delegation is confident that with his immense wealth of experience, he will steer the session very successfully. zambia assures him of its total support during his tenure of office. let me, at this point, pay tribute to mr. kurt waldheim, the fourth secretary-general of the united nations, and later president of austria, who died on 14 june 2007. to us, he was a great diplomat who made africa one of his priorities, especially at the height of the liberation struggle in southern africa. may i take this opportunity to thank her excellency sheikha rashed al khalifa of bahrain for having presided over the affairs of the sixty-first session in an exemplary manner. among her accomplishments was the carrying forward of the united nations reforms called for at the 2005 world summit. it was gratifying to have a lady preside over the highest office of the general assembly after almost three decades of male dominance. i hope that this organ will not again take that long to have an excellent woman as president. let me now congratulate mr. ban ki-moon of the republic of korea on his election as the eighth secretary-general of the united nations. i am confident that he will build upon the strong foundation that was laid by his predecessor, kofi annan of ghana, to whom i wish to pay tribute for the manner in which he steered the organization during his tenure in office. he made africa proud, and i wish him success in his current and future endeavours. our world today presents many challenges. these include abject poverty for the majority of the worlds inhabitants, underdevelopment, conflict, human trafficking, climate change, terrorism, violations of human rights, the hiv/aids pandemic and gender inequality. while some of these challenges have only recently emerged, others have been with us from time immemorial. these challenges cannot be entirely resolved within national boundaries or at the regional level. they can be resolved only at the multilateral level, with all the players carrying out their roles diligently. for that reason, zambia supports a strong and coherent united nations. we agree with the recommendation of the high-level panel on united nations system-wide coherence that the united nations urgently needs more coherence and synergy. that will enable it to perform as one and to use its unique universality, neutrality and capacity to operate efficiently. furthermore, zambia supports the ongoing reforms of the united nations. in particular, we welcome the mandate given to the economic and social council to make it more effective in executing its duties, which include formulating policy recommendations on international and social issues, as well as coordinating activities of specialized agencies in the economic, social and related fields. in that regard, collaboration of the united nations with the international financial institutions and the world trade organization should be further enhanced; we welcome the work going on in this area. this brings me to another issue: reform of the security council. this matter has remained unresolved for more than a decade. united nations reform cannot be complete without meaningful reform of the security council. any new proposals to reform that vital organ should seriously consider africas call to have two permanent seats with full veto power. africa is aware that the veto is an undemocratic instrument and would prefer to do away with it altogether. however, as long as others insist on keeping the veto, africa should have it as well. the status quo is unacceptable. it is my hope that during mr. kerims tenure of office, this aspect of the reform process will be concluded successfully. the issue of climate change is very important to the current and future inhabitants of our planet. it is therefore fitting that one theme of this session is responding to climate change. i commend the secretary-general for organizing the 24 september 2007 high-level event on this matter. indeed, the effects of climate change are being felt mostly by the developing countries. for instance, southern africa is experiencing critical food shortages due to torrential rains in some areas and severe drought in other parts of the region. the problem of climate change is a global issue requiring global action within the multilateral context of the united nations. as a signatory to the united nations framework convention on climate change and the kyoto protocol, zambia has already taken several measures to implement those international instruments. in that regard, we submitted our first national communication report in 2004. we have also taken deliberate steps to create public awareness about the problem of climate change so that our people can devise appropriate local interventions. regarding measures aimed at adapting to climate change, zambia has just finished formulating its national adaptation programme of action. the programme will help us identify the most vulnerable sectors of our economy, as well as adaptation activities required to alleviate the adverse effects of climate change. for this reason, we call upon the international community to ensure that the adaptation fund under the climate change convention, which has taken rather long to establish, is made operational. while placing emphasis on adaptation, we also pledge to reduce emissions from industrial and other sources. we call upon industrialized countries, which have a history of producing these emissions, to take serious steps to reduce them. we believe that the situation is now serious and that narrow national interests in this matter must be discarded forthwith. as a developing country, zambia needs assistance to enhance its capacity in key adaptive areas, such as scientific research, early warning and rapid response, to address the adverse effects of climate change. accordingly, zambia calls for the speedy development and transfer of appropriate technologies to help us cope with the negative impacts of climate change, as well as to put us on a low-carbon path to economic growth. we also call for a more comprehensive institutional framework for international environmental governance. in 2000, the developing world embraced the millennium development goals (mdgs) as a comprehensive strategy to move our countries out of economic and social decline and better integrate us into the global economy. halfway through the implementation period, many countries are far from attaining most of the goals. that is so in spite of the improved economic performance recorded by some developing countries following recent debt relief initiatives, coupled with sustained prudent economic management. to illustrate the point, in zambia the economy grew by 6.2 per cent last year, and inflation declined to a single digit level for the first time in 30 years. those economic gains, however, have not translated into a significant decline in the incidence of poverty, which stands at 68 per cent. zambias development efforts are further compromised by the hiv/aids pandemic and, now, the adverse effects of climate change. with regard to the hiv/aids pandemic, my government has declared it to be a national crisis, requiring sustained mitigation and preventive measures. i would like to take this opportunity to thank all our cooperating partners for their support to zambia in the fight against hiv/aids, tuberculosis and malaria. despite these challenges, zambia, for its part, has made steady progress and is likely to meet most of the mdgs by 2015. the goals most likely not to be attained by 2015 are: reducing by three quarters the maternal mortality ratio, integrating the principles of sustainable development into the countrys policies and programmes and reversing the loss of environmental resources. our goal now is to translate the economic achievements into tangible improvements in the quality of life of the zambian people. that goal is enshrined in zambias vision 2030, which is aimed at raising the country to middle-income status, significantly reducing hunger and poverty and fostering a competitive and outward-oriented economy. but that goal will remain elusive if our cooperating partners do not fulfil their commitments. indeed, it is saddening to note that total official development assistance declined in real terms by 5.1 per cent between 2005 and 2006, and only five donor countries have met or exceeded the 0.7 per cent target. i urge the cooperating partners to fulfil their commitments. furthermore, while zambia welcomes the discussions and progress made on aid effectiveness following the paris declaration, we call for official development assistance to be delivered in a more efficient manner, in accordance with the declaration. aid cannot be effective unless corruption is uprooted. my government has, therefore, declared war against that social vice. accordingly, i take this opportunity to urge the international community to desist from providing safe havens for leaders who plunder national resources. such ill-gotten wealth should be returned to the countries from where it was misappropriated so that it can be used to fight poverty. zambia condemns international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. for this reason, we call upon members of the international community to refrain from harbouring terrorists. zambia, for its part, supports the global initiative to combat nuclear terrorism. through regional bodies, such as the southern african development community (sadc), developing countries enhance their ability to cooperate and also jointly negotiate for better access to developed countries markets. consequently, during zambias current chairmanship of sadc, we shall continue to consolidate the formation of the sadc free trade area by 2008 as a prerequisite to the regional customs union. in addition, zambia will, on behalf of sadc, seek funding to develop an adequate regional transboundary infrastructure in support of much-needed connectivity in areas such as water, transport, energy, communications and information technology. many regions, including africa, have been dogged by conflict. this has adversely affected the countries potential to participate in the global economic arena. in the quest for peace in our subregion, sadc has launched a stand-by brigade, which will have the capacity for peace support operations. it is our hope that the international community will render necessary support to the brigade to enable it to fulfil its mandate. better still, sadc and zambia value the tenets of democracy, political stability and integrated economic development as the ultimate sound basis for peace and stability. sadc will, therefore, continue to promote the conducting of free and fair elections in the region. mr. berdymukhammedov (turkmenistan), vice- president, took the chair in conclusion, i wish to reaffirm, with regard to the theme of this session, zambias commitment to cooperate with the international community in addressing the problem of climate change. it is my sincere hope that all of us will play our full part, according to our abilities to deal with this serious global challenge. to that end, we should not remain indecisive and indifferent to this serious issue. neither should we miss the opportunity to do what we can to make the world a better place to live in.",Zambia,Africa,61.1270904541016,1.240759968757629,1805.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.554016620498615
ETH,62,2007,"allow me to begin by congratulating you, mr. president, on your election to the presidency of the general assembly at its sixty- second session. i would like to assure you of my countrys fullest cooperation in the discharge of the responsibilities bestowed upon you. i have no doubt that this assembly will benefit from both your personal and professional experience. may i take this opportunity to commend your predecessor, ambassador haya rashed al-khalifa, for her invaluable contributions and wise leadership during the assemblys previous session. i would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to secretary-general ban ki-moon. he is already fully engaged and has made an excellent beginning in the efforts to address global challenges since he took office a year ago. i would therefore, on this occasion, like to underline ethiopias firm commitment to cooperate in every way in assisting him in his demanding endeavours. just three weeks ago, ethiopia began its third millennium. this assembly has recognized the ethiopian millennium as a world event. on 15 june 2007, it adopted resolution 61/270, designating the year from 12 september 2007 to 11 september 2008 as the year of the ethiopian millennium. the assembly of the african union also declared the ethiopian millennium as a part of african heritage and a unique occasion. we thank you all for that honour and for that expression of solidarity. those who have witnessed how ethiopians of all walks of life have received the new ethiopian millennium could not have missed the new spirit that has been on display in the country. this is a spirit of renewal and commitment to stand in unity for a better future for the country. the new millennium was greeted by all ethiopians with a pledge to do more for national harmony and for durable peace and stability and to prevail against the poverty that has been the hallmark of the country in recent decades. two thousand years ago, ethiopia was the home of one of the great civilizations of the world, at aksum. a thousand years ago, we could still produce two of the worlds greatest heritage sites. one is the city of harar, the fourth holiest city of islam, which by happy coincidence also celebrates its own millennium this year. the other is the city of churches built by lalibela, a saint, priest and emperor in the town that still bears his name today. but ethiopias fortune began to change, commencing in the second half of the last millennium. though a survivor of colonialism and a representative of the greatness of africas past, ethiopia also unfortunately came to represent and symbolize the poverty, dearth and destitution of africas more recent history. despite the formidable challenges we have faced, all of this has begun to change in the last decade. hopelessness and frustration growing out of a lack of confidence in the future is no longer an image reflecting the reality of ethiopia. that is perhaps the explanation for the exuberance displayed by all sectors of ethiopian society in welcoming the new millennium. a new and strong national consensus is being created in ethiopia today. it is a consensus around conviction and the resolve to make the opening of our third millennium a symbol of ethiopian renaissance. that overwhelming optimism displayed by all ethiopians at the opening of the new millennium rests on a tangible foundation. the political, social and economic realities in ethiopia have been changing over the past decade. we are making meaningful progress. indeed, we have no shortage of detractors. these are non-ethiopians determined to scuttle the progress we are making in all areas. their attempts include efforts to undermine national unity and to micromanage ethiopias internal affairs. we have seen this, including over the past few days. despite all this, however, we continue to make progress. for five consecutive years now, our real gross domestic product growth rate has averaged over 10 per cent. our per capita income growth has averaged nearly 8 per cent for the last seven years. more tangible perhaps, in terms of the progress we have been making to change the life situation of our people, is the advance we have registered towards achieving the millennium development goals. we are set to attain universal primary health care by 2010. we are well on the way to achieving the goals set for reducing child and maternal mortality well prior to 2015. we have made much progress in combating hiv/aids, malaria and other diseases. we have managed to halt and stabilize the spread of hiv/aids and reduce the incidence of malaria. what we have been able to achieve in the area of education has been quite remarkable as well. there is now little doubt that we are on our way to achieving universal primary education by 2015. primary school enrolment at present is 91.6 per cent. sixteen years ago, it stood at 19 per cent. we have also begun to ensure that the education available will, in fact, be quality education. we have also committed ourselves to environmental sustainability in a tangible manner. our new ethiopian millennium celebrations and the preparations leading to them have underlined practical expressions to this commitment. the slogan two trees for 2000 has been enthusiastically taken up throughout the country. popular enthusiasm has led to the acceleration of the process that began earlier, culminating, after just three or four months, in the opening of the new millennium and the planting of close to a billion trees. this is a process that will continue throughout the year and beyond. nor are we oblivious to the spectre of global warming and the threat of climate change. africa is exceptionally vulnerable to the effects of climate change: so many of us live on the margins that the smallest difference in climate can mean the difference between sufficient food and famine, survival and death. it is a global challenge that requires a global response. however, the need for speedy economic development in countries such as ethiopia, and in africa as a whole, should not be compromised simply in order to reverse dangerous climatic situations for whose creation we have no responsibility. it should, nonetheless, be possible, through effective international collaboration, to ensure that the developmental process in countries such as ethiopia is environmentally friendly. in this regard, we welcome the proposal of brazil for a new united nations conference on the environment and development to be held in 2012. we are also appreciative of the european union's (eu) commitment to further cut its greenhouse gas emissions and to introduce more responsible and sustainable energy policies. we endorse the eu's support for reforming the institutional framework of united nations environmental activities. the economic and social progress ethiopia has made over the past decade has, no doubt, been underpinned by the real and concrete advances we have made in building democratic institutions and fostering the rule of law. in this regard as well, we are entering our new millennium with even greater and renewed commitment to deepening the democratic process in ethiopia and strengthening a culture of tolerance and mutual understanding among our people. there is a new spirit of tolerance, dialogue and inclusiveness and of commitment to peace among our people. the further democratization of the country and the nurturing of the rule of law is a pledge that every ethiopian is making as we enter our new millennium. this commitment is rooted in the conviction that durable peace in our country and the successful achievement of our objectives in the economic and social spheres can only be viable if we succeed in advancing towards achieving the democratic aspirations of our people. we urge those who wish to meddle in our affairs to remember that they will be held accountable for their action and that they should desist from seeking to place a trojan horse in our society. it is that same spirit of the new ethiopian millennium that must guide our foreign policy. we have, over the last decade and a half, worked in good faith for peace in our region. we are more prepared now than ever and, in the spirit of the new millennium, to contribute our share to achieving peace and understanding among peoples and countries, most particularly in our own subregion. we are indeed fully aware that the basis for the renaissance of ethiopia, to which we are committed in our new millennium, cannot be limited to what we do in ethiopia alone. to be true to the new spirit and to succeed in the rejuvenation of ethiopia, we feel we have the obligation to stretch a hand of friendship to all of those, near and far, who see wisdom in a positive response to this gesture. we are well aware of the need for a regional atmosphere conducive to the rejuvenation of our region and of ourselves. it is not just the absence of conflict and dispute, but the reality of peace and cooperation, which is, we know, an absolute necessity. without this we cannot achieve our aims, whether in ethiopia, our region, or in africa. allow me to express our profound appreciation to all those who have helped us make the progress we have made over the past decade. there are those who have been steadfast in their support for our endeavours and who have stood with us through thick and thin. we are indebted to them. our obligation is to be true to the principles that underpin those expressions of solidarity. ethiopia, a founding member of the united nations, will continue to be devoted to multilateralism and the fullest cooperation with the united nations. therefore, as i conclude, i wish to reiterate, once again, our readiness to cooperate fully, and without reserve, with our secretary-general in all areas where our contribution is needed and to seek friendship with all nations in the spirit of our new millennium.",Ethiopia,Africa,38.995979309082,5.451129913330078,1645.0,23.0,0.0,23.0,13.98176291793313
BDI,63,2008,"at the outset, i would like to join previous speakers, on behalf of his excellency pierre nkurunziza, president of the republic of burundi, and our entire delegation, in offering our warmest congratulations to mr. miguel descoto brockmann on his outstanding election to the presidency. we congratulate the other members of the bureau as well. we would also like to pay well-deserved tribute to his predecessor, mr. srgjan kerim, for the skill and wisdom with which he guided the work of the general assembly at its sixty-second session. we also take this opportunity to congratulate mr. ban ki-moon once again on the skill and dynamism with which he is guiding our organization. we would also like to pay special tribute to his tireless devotion to the cause of peace and development in burundi as we attempt to consolidate peace and stability. finally we wish to thank the united nations integrated office in burundi. the sixty-third session of the general assembly is taking place at a time when the people of burundi are at last enjoying the end of the war between the government army and the parti liberation du peuple hutu-forces nationale de liberation (palipehutu- fnl). the representatives of both parties have been sitting at the same table since may, seeking to identify the ways and means to implement the comprehensive ceasefire agreement signed in tanzania on 7 september 2006. allow us to also thank the international community, the united nations, the african union and the regional peace initiative on burundi for their participation in the return of the leaders of the palipehutu movement to burundi. we also take this opportunity to call on that movement to commit itself resolutely to the peace process, in particular by ending its practice of forcing local populations to supply its fighters. for its part, the government of burundi reaffirms that it will spare no effort to ensure progress in the peace process. this session is taking place three years after the establishment of democratically elected institutions in our country, and it is the first time in our history that an elected government has lasted more than three years. this is an important stage in democracy. the people in general and the government in particular welcome that milestone. thanks particularly to the support of the peacebuilding commission, the government of burundi has just launched, throughout the country, dialogue frameworks between the socio-political partners of burundi: the leaders of political parties, members of parliament, civil society and the media. they exchange views on the current challenges to our country in order to reach a consensus on the way democracy should function in burundi. in the framework of promoting a sound justice system and national reconciliation, the government will soon organize nationwide elections on the machinery for transitional justice. our government is firmly committed to respecting human rights in all their forms. that is no easy task in a country that recently emerged from a civil war that lasted more than 15 years. nevertheless, a number of measures have been taken and others are under way. an independent national human rights commission and a national childrens forum will soon be launched. additionally, a new criminal code providing for severe punishment for gender-based 08-52272 10 violence is before parliament, which is now up and running normally. in the same vein, the government has established human rights focal points in all ministerial departments and is providing training in that area and in peace education. i note that in burundi, security is generally good throughout our national territory, but we are encountering certain forms of insecurity linked to attacks and killings as a result of armed robbery and land disputes. in order to control that phenomenon, the government has begun to disarm the civil population. that is a very important and difficult measure, particularly because there is a large number of weapons in private hands. we are convinced that, unless those weapons are taken out of circulation and destroyed, peace and security will always be under threat. we therefore count on the support of our development partners to recover all weapons and munitions, particularly once the palipehutu-fnl combatants have completed the integration process. indeed, although our country is arduously recovering from the devastating effects of civil war, its gross domestic product remains among the lowest in the world. the purchasing power of the population has fallen and inflation has risen apace, particularly given the international phenomenon of the generalized increase in the price of food and oil products. in a different vein, we recently organized a national housing and population census that will provide us with reliable data, without which it would be difficult to carry out sustainable development projects. the results of the census will allow the government to improve the drafting of school and health policies, to which we pay particular attention, as evidenced by the measures already taken to establish free health care for children under the age of five and women at childbirth, as well as free basic education. the government has negotiated and launched macroeconomic and structural reforms that our development partners support. those reforms are aimed at macroeconomic stabilization, the privatization of state enterprises, and bank and monetary management that is compatible with sustainable growth. the government is determined to fight corruption and tax fraud, and to promote real transparency in the management of public wealth. allow me to recall that an anti-corruption law has been enacted and that an anti-corruption brigade is now operating. the public oversight body is playing its role and we welcome the considerable contribution made by civil society organizations. burundi welcomes the ratification of the pact on security, stability and development in the great lakes region by nine members of the international conference on the great lakes region. we will, of course, pursue measures to ensure that all member states ratify the pact. we recall that burundi joined the east african community (eac) in july 2007. as i address this assembly, nine burundian members of parliament represent my country in the legislative assembly of the community. that integration represents certain challenges for the people and government of burundi, particularly with respect to the imminent creation of a common market and a customs union, to culminate in the establishment of a political federation. we take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the states members of eac, which understand the difficulties facing a country emerging from conflict, such as burundi, and have implemented measures to assist our integration. of course, we also count on the support of our development partners to help us in all areas of integration that we consider to be strategic for the political stability and development of the countries of the subregion. maintaining peace and security is a multidimensional task subject to the many challenges that our organization is called upon to address. these include conflict prevention and resolution, combating terrorism, combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and combating poverty, hunger and disease, including the hiv/aids pandemic. the united nations is mobilizing many efforts and resources to meet those challenges. while it is true that considerable progress has been achieved, our organization still has much to do, because the way forward is still long. we should also point out that bloody conflicts and hotbeds of tension remain, including in somalia, darfur, iraq, afghanistan and the middle east, et cetera. terrorism is gaining ground all the time and is causing more death than conventional war. but we should not be discouraged. on the contrary, our organization must demonstrate the capacity to prevent this type of conflict and provide effective remedies for the ills threatening humanity. 11 08-52272 in the name of international solidarity, burundi has decided to make its modest contribution towards resolving some of those crises, by providing military observers and police officers in darfur and cote divoire, and to military peacekeeping contingents in somalia in the framework of operations established by the african union. burundi enthusiastically welcomed the global challenge represented by the millennium development goals (mdgs), which were adopted in 2000 and reaffirmed in the 2005 world summit outcome document (resolution 60/1). we are pleased to report that, through its policy of free primary education and health care for children under five years and women in childbirth, burundi is achieving successes that deserve support. while thanking those countries and peoples who have been of such great help to us since the launch of the policy in 2005, we would like to call for international solidarity, because the policy requires considerable government resources that our country cannot acquire on its own. indeed, the world solidarity fund for the promotion of social and human development and the global fund to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria do exist, but unfortunately, despite those initiatives the results are still modest. we therefore appeal to developed countries that have not yet done so to keep their promise to allocate 0.7 per cent of gross national income to official development assistance. special attention should be given to problems including putting order into the international financial markets, the need to increase investment in africa, the rational management of water and energy resources, technology transfer, international trade agreements, climate change and the management of toxic waste. it is more urgent than ever to harmonize the procedures and instruments for achieving our common objectives, including efforts to counteract hunger, reduce poverty worldwide and to ensure peacebuilding. otherwise, we will witness the persistence of phenomena including the tragedy of clandestine emigration, the brain drain, heightened crime and other ills. in closing, i wish to say that we hope that a minimum of political will and strengthened international solidarity will enable the united nations to find appropriate solutions to the scourges affecting our era. long live international solidarity. long live the united nations.",Burundi,Africa,48.0840606689453,5.19290018081665,1631.0,6.0,1.0,7.0,4.291845493562231
DZA,63,2008,"i wish at the outset to congratulate mr. miguel descoto brockmann on his election to the presidency of the general assembly at its sixty-third session. i also pay well-deserved tribute to his predecessor, mr. srgjan a/63/pv.13 08-53122 24 kerim, and thank secretary-general ban ki-moon for the dignified, far-sighted and able manner in which he has carried out his heavy responsibilities since his election. the central theme of this session and the subjects chosen for two high-level events are a perfect reflection of the international communitys current concerns. in recent months, the world has experienced crises that have revealed our collective vulnerability and our inability to confront those crises. as always, since the world order is based on that imbalance, the developing countries in particular pay the highest price by being powerless to meet the challenges that threaten their political stability and social cohesion. the president returned to the chair. in that regard, the consequences of climate change and the food crisis caused by the scarcity and soaring prices of certain basic commodities have plunged millions of people into extreme poverty. international financial and economic institutions, whose mission it is to anticipate crises and alert the international community to their potential risk, must play their proper role by undertaking the needed reforms without requiring developing countries, in particular african countries, to abide by commitments incompatible with their development goals. we must effectively and resolutely combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. we stress once again the importance and urgency of adopting a comprehensive counter-terrorism convention, while avoiding any provisions or stipulations that would prejudice the legitimate struggle of people to reclaim their freedom or of discrediting any particular religious community. it is indispensable to continue the work of reforming the organization so that it can become an instrument to promote freedom, democracy, justice, peace, security, development and progress. such reform will be fruitful and promising only if it includes reform of the security council through the equitable expansion of its membership, the democratization of its decision-making processes and the improvement of its working methods. algerias actions in the geographical and political spheres to which it belongs are based on the principles of good-neighbourliness, cooperation and solidarity. in the arab maghreb, algeria is working to ease the difficulties we are experiencing, which have hindered the re-launching of the arab maghreb union, in the conviction that the destiny of our peoples and the requirements of our times demand the advent of a united and prosperous maghreb. we are, however, keen to ensure that efforts in that regard do not meet with new disappointments, and we therefore think that that re-launching must be undertaken on a sound, solid and lasting basis that takes into account the enlightened self-interest of all the peoples of the region. inspired by its faith in that ideal of the maghreb, algeria has sincerely supported and will continue to support efforts to find a just, lasting and internationally legitimate solution to the conflict in western sahara that will allow the saharawi people to exercise freely and transparently their inalienable right to self- determination. that is why algeria believes it vital that the momentum created by the manhasset process be preserved and encouraged. we cannot overstress the responsibility of all the parties. we have made an urgent appeal to the secretary-general to participate in actions to remove obstacles to the negotiating process and to bring about conditions that will permit the holding of the fifth round of the process as soon as possible, as required by the relevant resolutions of the security council. algeria, for its part, will continue to assume fully the role dictated by its status as a neighbourly country and an observer of the process. on the middle east, algeria is pleased to note the positive developments in lebanon and encourages all parties to persevere on the path of unity and national reconciliation. it is obvious that the middle east will know no peace without a settlement of the palestinian question, which is at the core of the israeli-arab conflict. there is no need for me to remind the assembly that the advent of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the middle east will inevitably require restoring to the palestinian people their national and historic rights, including their right to an independent state, with al-quds al-sharif as its capital, the return of refugees and the restoration of all the other arab territories occupied by israel. on that basis, we appeal to the international community to fully shoulder its responsibilities towards the palestinian people, to support their just cause politically and to step up its humanitarian assistance in order to ease their suffering. the african continent has been experiencing profound and promising changes. undeniably, it is in the field of peace that the continents achievements a/63/pv.13 25 08-53122 have been the most remarkable. thus, the african union and other regional organizations have become respected and necessary partners, particularly in preventing and settling african crises. algeria welcomes these positive trends. we regret, however, that the support and commitment of africas partners remain below the agreed objectives, both with respect to restoring peace and to economic and social development programmes. we believe it is of the greatest importance to refrain from any action likely to thwart current peace efforts or to undermine the unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of the sudan. we must therefore mobilize the international community to promote the political process, which remains the only way to ensure that the sudanese people can benefit from the restoration of peace and national reconciliation. in that regard, we reiterate our support for the efforts and proposals of the league of arab states, the african union, the organization of the islamic conference and the non-aligned movement, calling on the security council to freeze the decision of the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court and to promote and consolidate the dynamics of peace and national reconciliation. similarly, with regard to the situation in zimbabwe, algeria can only welcome the approach adopted by the african union and the southern african development community to enable the people of zimbabwe to overcome their current difficulties. we are solidly behind africas efforts to settle the somali crisis by means of unreserved support for the political process and the dispatch of a peace mission to help the transitional authorities to restore peace and security in the country. there is no way to overcome the dangers to peace and harmony in the world other than concerted efforts and consultations on the basis of a renewed equitable and effective multilateral system that places the non-discriminatory fulfilment of human needs and the preservation of human dignity at the heart of its concerns. from that standpoint, the fight against all the ills that afflict large swathes of humankind whether extreme poverty, endemic disease, environmental problems or clandestine immigration can be won only if we all, and in particular the developed countries, join our efforts. the two high-level meetings during this session, and others to be held over the next few months will undeniably test our capacity to respond collectively and solidly to the challenges of our time.",Algeria,Africa,75.1360473632812,4.111420154571533,1188.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.8417508417508417
TUN,63,2008,"i wish at the outset to sincerely congratulate you, sir, on your election as president of the general assembly at its sixty-third session. we are convinced that your diplomatic ability and skill will help us to ensure the success of this session and to attain the objectives to which we all aspire. i should also like to thank mr. srgjan kerim for his excellent work and his valuable contributions to the smooth conduct of the previous session. our sincere thanks go also to the secretary-general, mr. ban ki-moon, for his generous efforts to promote the work of the organization and to enhance its performance in addressing various issues of importance to our countries and peoples. the choice of the main theme of this years general debate the impact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world reflects the importance of that issue and the growing awareness among all countries of its seriousness and of the need to work together to find effective solutions to reduce its impact and repercussions on national economies, particularly those of developing and poor countries, and on the increasing rates of poverty and hunger throughout the world. in that context, the central role played by the united nations is of crucial importance in addressing those issues and in striving to achieve a better balance in international relations and greater solidarity, justice and equality. that requires that we enhance the 5 08-53129 organizations reform process and strengthen its capacity to keep abreast of international developments. in recent years, the world situation has been characterized by increasingly swift change, which has disrupted international balances and undermined prevailing development formulas. it has also created many problems and difficulties that have clearly affected the economies and development processes of many countries. in addition, it has weakened their capacity to make progress and increased their vulnerability. furthermore, the world has recently witnessed serious economic problems, in particular an excessive rise in oil and basic food prices, which has threatened world food security and reduced the purchasing power of individuals, thus hampering the achievement of the goals and approaches set at the millennium summit. if we are to address this grave situation, we must step up international efforts by adopting development strategies based on the noble human aspects of world solidarity. in that context, tunisia has called on international financial institutions and other organizations that specialize in economy and trade to establish and implement agricultural and production policies that guarantee the availability of food, which is a fundamental right enshrined in international human rights instruments. i should like to take this opportunity to reiterate our call for intensified efforts to operationalize the world solidarity fund, endorsed by the general assembly in 2002 (resolution 57/265) on the initiative of tunisia as a mechanism to address the issues of poverty and privation in the world and to reduce disparities among peoples. in order to keep abreast of the profound changes on the international scene and the new realities they have produced in international relations, along with the various challenges and complexities those changes represent, we must act to strengthen the capacity of the united nations to act more efficiently. we must also endeavour to reform the organization, develop its structures and enhance the role it is expected to play to ameliorate the current international situation and turn globalization into a process that helps to guarantee peace and development for all peoples. in that context, tunisia supports all efforts and initiatives aimed at establishing new frameworks and mechanisms for action that can help to find collective solutions to common challenges in the vital fields of security, peace, development, the environment and food security, as part of an appropriate approach to international relations founded on the complementarity between peace, security and development. however, that should be accompanied by strengthened multilateral action on the basis of cooperation, solidarity and a constructive dialogue among all countries. despite efforts to contain it, the heightened problem of terrorism in the world strengthens our belief in the need to unify the international approach to fighting that scourge and finding adequate solutions to it. since the early 1990s, tunisia has warned the international community against the dangers of terrorism and has called for the adoption of a comprehensive and efficient approach that takes into consideration the root causes of the scourge. today, we renew the call of his excellency president zine el abidine ben ali to convene an international conference under the auspices of the united nations to develop an international code of conduct for the fight against terrorism to which all parties shall commit themselves. climate change and the resulting intensification of the problems of desertification, drought and the lack of drinking water pose a threat to all humankind today and are a source of great concern to all. while affirming the close link between the environment and development and the crucial importance of promoting cooperation and solidarity to respond to the challenges in that regard, we should like to emphasize the need to include concerns about the potential effects of climate change, particularly in the african and mediterranean regions, among the international communitys priorities, as called for in the tunis declaration adopted by the international solidarity conference on climate change strategies for the african and mediterranean regions, which was held in tunisia in november 2007. we would also like to reiterate the need to mobilize the necessary financial resources to promote research into climate monitoring and meteorology and the development of natural disaster early warning systems, in addition to the need to invest in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. we are convinced that the success of development efforts and the strengthening of 08-53129 6 cooperation among our countries depend on providing a secure and stable international environment. obstacles to success in that effort include the intensification of tensions and conflicts and the persistence of unresolved problems. in that regard, we reaffirm tunisias commitment to the values of peace and to the principles of international legality as the path to achieving just and lasting solutions to pending international issues. we also renew our determination to promote the values of moderation, tolerance and mutual respect in relations among countries and peoples and to establish bridges of communication and dialogue among all civilizations, cultures and religions. in that context, while reaffirming tunisias position in support of our palestinian brothers and their just cause as a people, we renew our call to the international community, especially its most influential members and the quartet, to increase their efforts to bring israel to end its aggressive practices and settlement activities. we call on them to intensify their work to reinvigorate the peace effort and to facilitate the resumption of negotiations between palestinians and israelis on the basis of the relevant international terms of reference, the arab peace initiative and the results of the annapolis conference, with the aim of achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive solution to the palestinian question. such a solution would guarantee that the palestinians regain their legitimate national rights and establish an independent palestinian state on their national territory. it would also guarantee the withdrawal of israel from all occupied arab territories, including syrian and lebanese land. that solution would also provide security and stability for all the peoples of the region. we also call for joint regional and international efforts to address the deterioration of security and humanitarian conditions in iraq and to help the brotherly iraqi people to restore security and stability so that they may devote their energies to reconstruction efforts while preserving their national and territorial unity. we wish to take this opportunity to express our satisfaction with the recent positive developments in our sisterly country of lebanon, namely, the election of the countrys president and the establishment of a government of national unity. we trust that our lebanese brothers will further strengthen that process in order to preserve lebanons security and stability. since the change of 7 november 1987, and under the wise leadership of president zine el abidine ben ali, president of the republic of tunisia, we have succeeded in accomplishing remarkable achievements in every area, due to substantial reforms that have strengthened the democratic process, promoted mechanisms to protect human rights and culture and consecrated public freedoms. those reforms have enabled us to expand the scope of consultation and participation by the various sectors of civil society in identifying major trends and determining crucial national options within the framework of the rule of law and respect for institutions. those reforms have also made it possible to achieve many of the millennium development goals, which has led to the improvement of living standards and the well-being of all segments of tunisian society. those achievements reflect the sound development choices and approaches implemented in tunisia, which have allowed us to reach a high position on the list of countries with the highest human development indicators. that has earned tunisia the respect of international financial institutions and the specialized agencies of the united nations. in its various development plans, tunisia has continued to work for development and modernization in order to strengthen its capacity to keep up with international changes and actively contribute to building a world of peace and security and to make international relations more balanced and based on solidarity. based on its desire to achieve a higher level of integration at the regional and international levels, tunisia is working to expand its participation in regional and international organizations and to develop political relations with friendly countries. it also endeavouring to expand and diversify its scope of cooperation with them so as to establish an effective partnership based on mutual respect and common interests. in that regard, tunisia firmly believes that the arab maghreb union is a strategic and crucial choice for all peoples of the region. in cooperation and coordination with the other friendly maghreb countries, we are sparing no effort to speed up the establishment of the union. 7 08-53129 tunisia is also eager to promote joint arab action and to enhance its ability to interact with regional and international bodies in order to address the changes taking place in the region and to contribute to the promotion of the reform and modernization process in the arab world, in conformity with the decisions of the 2004 arab summit held in tunis. with regard to africa, tunisia is contributing to the achievement of peace and security in the continent by participating in united nations peacekeeping operations and by developing economic relations with friendly african countries. based on our belief in the importance of joint african action and the fact that the african union is the ideal framework to address the continents problems and achieve the integration to which our peoples aspire, tunisia reaffirms its strong determination to pursue the process decided within the framework of the african union to establish and operationalize its institutions, enhance its role in the resolution of conflicts and promote the development process in africa. with regard to europe, tunisia attaches strategic importance to its relations with the european union (eu) and is continuing to work to develop those relations on the basis of a solidarity-based partnership with eu countries on the basis of dialogue, cooperation and mutual respect. the building of a euro- mediterranean cooperation framework is one of tunisias priorities and a tenet of its foreign policy. tunisia has therefore supported every initiative and mechanism that contributes to the promotion of peace, solidarity and development in the mediterranean region including the barcelona process, the 5+5 dialogue, and the mediterranean forum. tunisia was among the first countries to welcome the french initiative on the establishment of the union for the mediterranean. we are convinced that the future of that initiative depends upon an effective partnership that guarantees the active participation of the countries of the southern mediterranean in establishing the foundations of the union and in the taking of decisions of concern to the region. meeting the challenges posed by the new international situation and the profound changes taking place on the world scene requires us all to step up efforts to further entrench the noble universal principles and humanist values on which the united nations was founded. it also requires perseverance in enhancing the process of united nations reform to make its work more efficient and to ensure its active contribution to providing optimum international conditions that can help us find collective solutions to common challenges and current international issues, respond to our peoples aspirations for stability, and provide the appropriate conditions for prosperity and well-being in an environment of cooperation and solidarity-based development.",Tunisia,Africa,77.7146224975586,6.271570205688477,2103.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.4265335235378032
STP,63,2008,"i believe that nearly everything has already been said here since the beginning of the sixty-third session of the general assembly. some were things that we africans wanted to hear and some we could have done without. but i have come to new york once again to join other heads of state who are concerned with the state of the planet, which faces armed conflicts, environmental catastrophes some naturally occurring and some the result of thoughtless and selfish behaviour and attitudes of some among us as well as multiple financial crises, including extreme increases in the price of oil and basic food products. on behalf of the people of the islands of sao tome and principe, i should like to congratulate mr. miguel descoto brockmann on his election to the presidency of the general assembly at its sixty-third session and to wish him every success. i am certain that the themes he has put forward for discussion at this session are a reflection of his concern about the various international problems currently affecting the world. i would dare say that we are doubly blessed by his qualities as a diplomat, which are well known, and as a priest. allow me also to take this opportunity to 23 08-51845 thank and commend his predecessor for a job well done. the report (a/63/1) of the secretary-general to the assembly exhaustively describes the world in which we live and reflects the major concerns of member states while providing guidance on how to resolve them. i believe it to be an important working document that deserves the closest attention from member states. the recent upheavals and conflicts that the world has experienced are proof of the fragility of the current system of international relations. that makes it necessary for the worlds main political actors to engage in permanent dialogue to find lasting solutions that will make it possible for nations and peoples to concentrate on social and economic development issues. with regard to development, i would like to commend the secretary-general on his selection of themes for the high-level meetings, the first of which took place the day before the opening of the general debate and the second of which is taking place today. we hope that those who, during the first three days of the general debate, have reaffirmed their determination to continue their solidarity towards africa will translate the intentions expressed here into action. i need not reiterate my countrys position with regard to chronic unresolved conflicts, especially the situation in the middle east, including the palestinian issue, the perennial latent conflict in our subregion that is taking place in the democratic republic of the congo, and the humanitarian situation in darfur and its impact. our attention and available resources are focused on efforts to eradicate poverty, ensure food security and achieve the millennium development goals (mdgs). despite the enormous efforts of my people and the hardships they have suffered, my country will not be able to achieve all the goals by 2015. the food crisis, the financial crisis and the constraints of insufficient aid linked to inadequate processes are all contributing to deteriorating prospects. paradoxically, the number of poor people is increasing rather than decreasing. we are continuing our efforts to reverse that situation, by example, by greatly increasing microcredit loans in the agriculture and fisheries sectors in an attempt to ensure some measure of food security. however, despite the relatively unfavourable overall environment, there have been some success stories. for example, in recent years, sao tome and principe has made great progress with regard to child mortality indicators; we are certain that we will achieve the targets established in the mdgs. we have also made progress in the area of education. with adequate support from our partners and the international community, we will be able to achieve the relevant targets set out in the mdgs. according to data published in 2007, the incidence of hiv/aids infection has increased in my country. we have attempted to provide free or subsidized antiretroviral treatment for all, with help from the federative republic of brazil. we are also carrying out an aggressive policy to educate people in order to prevent the disease and promote safe sexual practices. sao tome and principe is an archipelago that includes three mountainous islands. despite our mountainous terrain, however, our people are increasingly concerned about the advancing sea at high tide. according to records, no waves higher than three metres have broken on our shores in the past 110 years. however, giant waves have begun to wash over our coastal highways in the past 10 years, temporarily cutting off certain regions of our country. i cannot overemphasize the strong appeal i made from this rostrum in the past to those who are primarily responsible for the global warming that afflicts the planet, namely, that they address this phenomenon and the means to mitigate its effects with much greater seriousness. in his statement at the opening of the sixty-third session of the general assembly (see a/63/pv.1), the assembly president said that love was the greatest need in todays world and that the selfishness of some has led to the current situation. this may perhaps be considered overly simplistic coming from the mouth of a head of state, but i believe that that is precisely the core of the problem. our governments, diplomats and politicians rarely think in such terms. no people chooses to be poor. being poor does not imply that we are less intelligent or lazier than others. it all has to do with the opportunities available at the time of birth, as well as to the solidarity and compassion one encounters thereafter when these are not empty words. yes, we must re-establish generosity and solidarity among human beings. 08-51845 24 an example of that is the fact that there was a decrease of more than 95 per cent in the number of cases of malaria recorded in sao tome and principe in 2007. as a result, we expect that the disease will soon be eradicated from our country through an ongoing control programme. for the first time in centuries, as confirmed by the most recent report of the world health organization on the state of the worlds health, malaria is not the main cause of child mortality and morbidity among the people of my country. that has been possible thanks to the republic of china on taiwan. speaking of solidarity and taiwan, once again from this rostrum, i would like to appeal to the conscience of each and every member to consider the fate to which 23 million taiwanese have been relegated. will the community of nations represented here continue to ignore the existence of a population comprising more than 23 million people? i must remind the assembly that the republic of china on taiwan is a country with a vibrant democracy and an enviable economic and technological record that has served as a development model for the global economy. on 20 may 2008, we were pleased to see the inauguration of the new president of that friendly country. we paid close attention to his inaugural address, which was a genuine call for peace and good relations in the taiwan strait. also regarding the lack of solidarity in the world, the embargo against cuba is another cause for concern that requires our urgent attention. that relic from the past must be lifted on an urgent basis, especially in the aftermath of the destruction caused by the two successive hurricanes that recently struck that friendly nation. the united states administration has a golden opportunity to demonstrate to the world that the statements of its leaders are not just rhetorical exercises. at the same time, i would like to make it very clear that sao tome and principe is a tenacious defender of the measures to combat international terrorism and to prevent the further loss of innocent life. development strengthens diplomacy and security, reduces threats against our collective security and produces peaceful, stable and prosperous societies. that must be the focus of our efforts. i should therefore, in conclusion, reiterate what i said at the outset: we must all be less selfish and care more about each other, rather than just ourselves.",Sao Tome and Principe,Africa,69.5363922119141,5.554490089416504,1372.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.4577259475218658
SDN,63,2008,"it is indeed my pleasure, on behalf of the leadership, people and government of the sudan, to greet the general assembly as it meets in its sixty-third session. we wish its deliberations every success and hope to witness tangible progress on all the issues and challenges that must be given priority by this organization. we refer, of course, to the maintenance of international peace and security; realizing the millennium development goals (mdgs); containing the food crisis, poverty, hunger, climate change and water shortages; and reactivating the role of the united nations in a changing world. we are indeed delighted to see mr. miguel descoto brockmann chairing this session. we are confident that, with his wisdom, experience and perspicacity, we may indeed be hopeful and optimistic that the international community will realize its ambitions for global development, reconstruction and prosperity. i also wish to strongly commend and thank ambassador srgjan kerim for the competence with which he conducted the work of the sixty-second session. we also thank the secretary-general and his staff for the efforts that they continue to deploy in the service of the mandate of this organization. this session of the general assembly falls amid some very important and particular developments in the international and regional spheres. millions are looking forward to a world of peace, stability and prosperity that respects the common values and principles enshrined in the charter of the united nations, notably respect for the sovereignty of states, their choices, the peaceful settlement of disputes and joint cooperation in all fields. although we continue to hope for and work towards a capable and efficient united nations and a complete framework for multilateral cooperation that takes into consideration the wealth and diversity of the international community, we in the developing 08-51851 20 countries, especially in the african continent, remain profoundly convinced of the need to maintain those objectives and principles. we recall that our african continent has had a long and difficult journey as a result of its backwardness since it broke the yoke of colonialism and fought its post-independence wars, during which the objectives and aspirations of africans to lead a dignified life were forever thwarted by the so-called lost decades of development and the unfavourable economic and trade atmosphere. the political and security situation of the african continent has made it vulnerable to foreign interventions and conspiracies that have undermined its stability and rendered peace a more distant prospect. in addition to discussing the various and well- known threats and dangers facing the african continent and all developing nations, i should like to draw attention to and warn about the danger of the abuse of what is called universal jurisdiction. that concept that was condemned in july 2008 at the sharm el-sheikh summit, which called on the security council and the general assembly to seriously examine the issue and to cancel it. the politicization and abuse of the aforementioned principle clearly shows that disregard for and non-compliance with political and professional norms that are guided by the principles of the charter of the united nations and of international law, together with the application of double standards, pose grave dangers for the region and beyond, threatening the stability and prestige of the institutions of the international order. achieving peace and stability in the sudan has been a firm priority objective of our government, which has demonstrated its commitment to the option of peace, as reflected in the historic milestone achieved when we signed the comprehensive peace agreement on 9 january 2005 in nairobi. the agreement, which ended the longest-running conflict on the african continent since the colonial era, was reinforced by the darfur peace agreement, signed at abuja, and the eastern sudan peace agreement, signed at asmara, eritrea. our efforts to achieve peace have proceeded from our conviction that peace will create a favourable environment for the development of the sudans vast agricultural resources and wealth, which in turn will ensure the sustainability of peace. furthermore, peace in the sudan is a strategic goal aimed at reinforcing stability in neighbouring countries, the region and the continent. thus, we appeal to all members of the international community, through the assembly, to support the efforts to achieve peace and stability in the sudan. by so doing, they will promote, enhance and guarantee peace and stability in the region and on the african continent. we must avoid doing anything that could negatively affect or jeopardize those efforts. while our country is firmly committed to implementing the provisions of the comprehensive peace agreement, in particular by holding general elections during the first half of next year and by completing our national programmes for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and de-mining, we hope that the international community will honour its financial commitments, including those pledges announced in oslo in 2005 and in norway in may 2008. here, in view of the difficulties and obstacles that we have encountered in implementing the agreement, i should like to recall a principle of western thought regarding the difference between words and deeds. we in the sudan believe that our desire for the cancellation of our foreign debt is in accordance with the spirit and requirements of peace agreements, since that debt is hampering our reconstruction efforts. we also call for the lifting of the unilateral sanctions imposed against our country, which defeat the true purpose of a comprehensive peace. in that way, the citizens of the sudan could benefit from the dividends of peace. the problem of darfur has been the chief concern of the people and the government of the sudan. no one is more eager than our people to achieve peace and stability in darfur, which, after all, is their problem and their responsibility. from this rostrum, we reaffirm our full commitment to achieving a peaceful political settlement of the crisis in darfur, one that will enhance the ongoing peace process through positive actions. these include the implementation of the people of the sudan initiative, aimed at developing a national consensus as to the best way to resolve the issue, as stated by the president of the republic during his recent important visit to darfur; the appointment of mr. jebreel basoli, joint chief negotiator, whom we fully support; the establishment of an arab-african committee, co-chaired by the prime minister of qatar, the chairperson of the commission of the african union and the secretary-general of the league of arab states, to mediate peace negotiations between the government of the sudan and the armed movements in 21 08-51851 darfur, in close cooperation and coordination with the representatives of the african union and the united nations; and the implementation of the initiative that was supported and welcomed by the african union, the league of arab states and the secretary-general of the united nations. the sudanese government of national unity sincerely hopes that those efforts will promptly lead to comprehensive peace and stability in darfur. we had hoped that the signing of the darfur peace agreement on 5 may 2006 as a result of the generous mediation of the african union would encourage the movements that had not signed the comprehensive peace agreement to do so. in particular, in order to ensure full implementation of the agreement, power-sharing and the establishment of the transitional darfur regional authority, male and female citizens of darfur have been appointed to executive and legislative positions and various arrangements have been put in place to ensure wealth- and power-sharing and security. however, as members are all aware, the movements that oppose peace have continued to boycott all the negotiations, undermining the efforts of mr. jan eliasson and mr. salim ahmed salim. the movements have continued to reject the peace option and to choose the military option, not to serve the interests of the people of darfur but to pursue a policy aimed at regime change in the sudan, as demonstrated in the military aggression carried out on 10 may 2008 against the sudanese capital itself. those movements would not have been able to do what they did had they not been receiving mixed or wrong messages from some circles, since they saw that the non-signatories were not being pressured to join the organ of peace, while those who signed the treaty were. that increased the intransigence of the non-signatories, threatening the chances for peace and the humanitarian conditions. with regard to peacekeeping and in accordance with the principles of positive cooperation with the united nations and the african union under the agreement reached at the high-level understandings in addis ababa on 16 november 2006, which led to the adoption of security council resolution 1769 (2007) establishing the mandate of the joint african union- united nations hybrid operation in darfur (unamid) the government of the sudan has fulfilled its commitments with regard to its role in the peace process in darfur and indeed has fulfilled many other steps. the status of forces agreement has been concluded. the mandate was transferred from the african union mission in the sudan to unamid on 31 december of last year. the headquarters have been built and operational capacities have been established in the three states of darfur. periodic coordination meetings between the government of the sudan and the command of the joint operation have been deliberating on all the problems and resolving them. on the humanitarian level, the government of the sudan remains committed to executing the humanitarian communique concluded with the united nations on 28 march 2007, which is being implemented in an exemplary manner as a result of the matchless follow-up mechanism to track the implementation of the humanitarian communique and the special efforts of the government to open humanitarian corridors in darfur and to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid. once again we renew our commitment to that effort. at a time when the government of national unity has taken giant strides to implement the peace agreement, with the full support of the president of the republic, the electoral law has been passed and approved by parliament to usher the sudan to yet another phase of democratic transformation and peaceful transfer of power through general elections to be held in 2009. the country is fully mobilized and engaged in turning over the page of violence and war in darfur, and amid those developments came the request of the prosecutor of the international criminal court (icc) to the pre-trial chamber to issue an arrest warrant. an arrest warrant against whom? against a man who ended the longest war in africa, a man who brought peace to eastern sudan and laid the foundations for peace in darfur. that request targeted the leadership of the state, the symbol of its sovereignty and dignity, in a failed attempt at political and moral assassination, as well as causing delay or erosion of the peace process for ulterior motives unrelated to justice or to the realization of peace and stability in darfur, and in a state that is not a signatory to the rome statute. moreover, the actions of the prosecutor disregard the road map agreed upon by the sudan, the united nations and the african union on the basis of the addis ababa understanding in november 2006 and the international conference on darfur held alongside the last session of the general assembly. the road map 08-51851 22 was further reiterated and endorsed by the security council in its resolution 1769 (2007). the road map was based on four tracks: rehabilitation and development, the peace process as a priority, the peacekeeping operation and the humanitarian track. thus the prosecutor is turning upside down the issue of accountability, which the government of the sudan supports and which is already being handled by a competent and effective sudanese judiciary, and giving it a completely different character by introducing it into the international criminal court and destabilizing justice and peace in the sudan and the region. it is an open invitation to the rebel movements that oppose peace to stay away from the peace option. the actions of the prosecutor seek to influence negatively the elections to be held in 2009, through which the government will enter into a new phase of peace and democratic transformation. from this rostrum, in the name of the government and the people of the sudan, who were unanimous in rejecting that step, i thank and commend all the active forces of more than two thirds of the international community, which through their regional, geographic and political institutions and organizations have condemned the measures taken by the icc prosecutor and called on the security council to rectify the situation arising from that action. here i specifically mean the member states of the african union, the league of arab states, the non-aligned movement, the organization of the islamic conference, the member states of the african, caribbean and pacific group of states and other countries that have expressed their disapproval and their complete rejection of that step taken by the icc prosecutor. i would like to assure the assembly that the government of the sudan is making progress in its resolute and principled goal of achieving lasting peace and removing the bitterness of war and its legacy in accordance with the values and principles of the people of the sudan and their mores, customs and traditions, which are based on peaceful coexistence, reconciliation and tolerance. the establishment of peace in darfur and in the sudan and the steps taken by the prosecutor of the international criminal court are two parallel lines that can never meet, hence such situations must be rectified as soon as possible and there must be a return to the commitment to the political process. since the issue of more democratic international relations was one of the subjects proposed for the general debate of this session, our country, like all other african countries, has been following the efforts to reform this organization especially the security council, which is charged with the maintenance of international peace and security and which has remained as it is since its inception while the entire international arena has been changing. that made reforming that council an urgent priority, so that it can be more responsive to the aspirations of the developing nations. i am referring specifically to africa, which has no permanent representation in the security council, whose agenda is beset with african issues. here i would like to reiterate that the sudan is in accord with the african position included in the ezulwini document on the issue of reforming the modus operandi and rules of procedure of the united nations so that it can be more democratic, transparent, express equitable geographic representation of the worlds continents and reflect the developments that the world has seen since 1945. economic and trade developments compete with each other. the failure of economic structures in many developing and least developed countries constitutes a problem that raises obstacles for the movement to realize the mdgs as soon as possible. the current structure of the international economy, with its restrictive, unfair trade practices and restrictions on the exports of developing nations, is a negative impact of globalization, in addition to the heavy external debt burden that paralyzes the regions national economic development. those obstacles are very serious and retard development, especially in the african continent. the united nations millennium summit emphasized the special position of africa as a priority with regard to international assistance and channels of cooperation and support through relevant initiatives like the new partnership for africas development (nepad) and other regional, subregional and national initiatives. here, let me mention that the sudan has implemented several quick-income projects and several short-term projects to benefit vulnerable groups. regarding the attainment of mdgs especially the alleviation of poverty, the development and support of education, health and the fight against diseases like 23 08-51851 malaria the state is still directing its efforts to attain those objectives and to realize sustainable development. we must take into consideration the potential of the country and its vast resources, which, according to reports of relevant international organizations, make it capable of helping to solve the global food crisis by providing food for millions around the world. national efforts in the sudan can currently be seen in the context of efforts to develop and revitalize the agricultural sector and to realize a comprehensive green revolution. here i must emphasize the serious negative impact of phenomena like climate change and environmental deterioration, which have constituted reasons for war and conflict in africa. the conflict in darfur is one practical example of the impact of those phenomena and how they directly affect the daily lives and needs of individuals. the sudan, as a party to the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) since 1999, emphasizes the need to put more effort and coordination into intensifying multilateral action to face those phenomena and to achieve a more efficient system for the post-2012 era. developing nations must also participate in dealing with the causes and effects of climate change. the sudan is of the view that developed nations should fulfil their commitments to capacity-building and should provide the financial and technical resources to support developing nations in facing those problems. the sudan emphasizes the fact that the maintenance of international peace and security requires, first and foremost, an urgent solution to the problem in palestine and that the situation be dealt with in a decisive and serious manner, especially in view of the tragic situation that the palestinian people in the occupied territories are facing. the international community is called upon today more than any other time to put pressure on the occupying authorities to abide by resolutions of international legitimacy so that the palestinian people may realize their full right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent state with jerusalem as its capital. in conclusion, i would like to emphasize that for the united nations to continue playing its important role imposes on us a collective responsibility to find the solid will and determination to make the organization a truly collective framework for multilateral, international efforts to deal effectively and justly with international issues and problems. the united nations must establish clear and transparent partnerships according to the charter with regional organizations in order to realize regional and international peace and security. the sudan, as a committed and active member of this organization, will remain faithful to the objectives that constitute our collective effort.",Sudan,Africa,53.5173797607422,1.851500034332275,3061.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.6533812479581835
MAR,63,2008,"allow me to begin by warmly congratulating his excellency mr. miguel descoto brockmann upon his election to the presidency of the general assembly at its sixty- 17 08-52265 third session. his election honours his long-lasting personal commitment to the preservation of peace and security and, particularly, his constant efforts to encourage reconciliation in central america. i also wish to thank mr. srgjan kerim for his excellent service as president of the general assembly at its previous session. i would also like to thank the secretary-general, ban ki-moon, for his generous and ongoing efforts to help reform our organization, in particular those aiming to improve its working methods and its interaction with its member states. twenty years ago, the fall of the berlin wall marked the end of a cold war era that had been characterized by ideological divisions, arms races and a weak multilateral system with inefficient mechanisms. with the end of that era came great hope and aspirations from the worlds peoples, leading some to believe in the beginning of a new world order a world order that would not only be more fair and equitable, but also distinguished by a culture of forgiveness among its nations. that new order was also meant to spread the values of democracy and human rights, giving priority to development and the better and more efficient utilization of technological advancements. at the same time, some people predicted that that new world order would restore prestige to the united nations, allowing it to achieve more consensus on international issues. rather than fulfilling the expectations of a better world after the cold war, todays reality has seen an increase in regional and internal conflicts, especially on the african continent. this situation is exacerbated by a race for energy resources and a frenzied exploitation of precious minerals. at the economic and trade levels, the launch of the world trade organization in 1994 in marrakesh led to a substantial acceleration of world trade exchanges, but it did not create a fair trade system that would respond to the expectations of developing countries. indeed, in spite of the efforts deployed in numerous united nations conferences, official development assistance (oda) has significantly decreased over recent years. in fact, the assistance provided by donor countries does not meet the expectations of developing countries despite the formers commitment to increase their global annual assistance to developing countries to $50 billion by 2010. therefore, notwithstanding the progress achieved over previous years, morocco, in addition to other countries, expresses its concern regarding the delay in the launching of development processes in many african countries. that delay is partly due to the complexity of the current international situation particularly marked by economic and financial crises, which have had an impact on food security and the energy needs of these countries. those circumstances undermine years of ongoing efforts towards the development of african countries. in order to improve that situation, the kingdom of morocco urges the united nations and relevant financial institutions to undertake all the arrangements necessary to stabilize the food market, to maintain social stability in developing countries and to open the market to agricultural products, taking into consideration the circumstances of the least developed countries. the weak role of the united nations in maintaining peace and security throughout the world during the cold war period was followed by a new phase, during which the multilateral system was characterized by the convening of several meetings and conferences focused on various global issues, as well as by the deployment of numerous peacekeeping operations, especially in africa. as a troop- contributing country, morocco has spared no efforts to increase its involvement in united nations peacekeeping forces. the kingdom is also actively promoting the enhancement of south-south cooperation by giving priority to african countries. to parallel the changes taking place in the international arena, united nations member states launched major reforms centred on improving the organizations actions, reinforcing its role and enhancing its mechanisms. nevertheless, some weaknesses remain in coordination among the various united nations bodies and between the organization itself and regional organizations. that is particularly evident in the efforts to contain and prevent regional conflicts with potential spillover effects. at this point, it is important to strengthen multilateralism in order to meet new challenges and to put in place a new order based on justice and equality. the pursuit of such an approach is not merely an option but is necessary, given the serious challenges 08-52265 18 facing international peace and security and sustainable economic and social development. the middle east peace process, initiated at the madrid conference in 1991, was unfortunately unsuccessful in ending the conflict, which continues to see heavy daily casualties and causes millions of palestinians to live in inhumane and tragic conditions. in this context morocco closely follows the latest developments regarding the situation in the middle east and encourages all initiatives aiming to bring peace to that region, with respect to international legality and to the agreements previously reached, namely the road map and the arab peace initiative. this last initiative undoubtedly represents a realistic solution, reflecting the true commitment of arab countries to reach a just, comprehensive and lasting solution that would allow the palestinian people to establish an independent state with al-quds as its capital and force israel to withdraw from all occupied arab land, a solution that would enable the people and the countries of the middle east to live in peace, stability and security. the kingdom of morocco equally expresses the necessity to respect the particular situation of jerusalem by avoiding degrading and humiliating practices and curtailing any attempts to undermine the specificities of the holy city in regard to culture, religion and civilization. in this regard, his majesty king mohammed vi, chairman of the al-quds committee, spares no effort in encouraging world leaders to help put an end to the projects taking place around the al-aqsa mosque and in other parts of jerusalem. as far as iraq is concerned, we closely follow progress on the ground and encourage dialogue and national reconciliation between the different ethnic, political and cultural factions in order to end the cycle of violence, to reach peace and stability, to preserve the territorial integrity of that brotherly country and to allow it to rebuild its economy. morocco also launched a regional initiative in june 2006 by convening an international ministerial conference on migration, development, environment and climate change. morocco considers the celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights the right occasion to appoint a united nations special rapporteur on human rights issues. it would aim to appropriately equip the united nations to play a leading role in ensuring that all citizens rights are protected and that the laws and political and economic mechanisms regarding respect for human rights are harmonized in order to promote those rights. the united nations is based on the principles of cooperation and neighbourly relations, with regional integration and cooperation representing the best means to ensure stability, economic development and an improved collective future. since its independence, the kingdom of morocco has placed the project of an arab maghreb union at the top of its priorities and considered it a strategic option. morocco is firmly committed to making the arab maghreb union the herald of an era of peace and the fulfilment of the common destiny of the populations of this region. the kingdom of morocco is strongly convinced about and deeply committed to overcoming all obstacles and to moving forward with regional integration into the arab maghreb union. the moroccan autonomy initiative regarding the western sahara, which was described by the security council as serious and credible, is the result of in-depth national consultations and widespread international consultations. as a result, the security council successfully and unanimously adopted three resolutions 1754 (2007), 1783 (2007) and 1813 (2008) that call upon parties to enter into true negotiations, taking into consideration the latest developments and particularly the moroccan initiative, which launched a new dynamic in favour of a lasting solution to this conflict. morocco remains strongly committed to continuing those negotiations with sincerity and goodwill in order to find a final solution to that regional conflict, one that would respect the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the kingdom of morocco and give the benefits of autonomy to the sahara and its population. it would be a lasting, comprehensive and realistic solution to that regional conflict. a strong, open, integrated and stable arab maghreb can play a key role in maintaining regional peace and security. along the shores of the mediterranean, it can also contribute to enhancing african integration and play an active role as an efficient and credible partner to achieve the noble goals for which the united nations was created.",Morocco,Africa,55.1479187011719,4.853390216827393,1460.0,7.0,0.0,7.0,4.794520547945206
MDG,64,2009,"it is with great pleasure that i speak from the rostrum of the united nations today representing madagascar, for which it is a particular honour to be able to contribute to the reflections and deliberations in this highly significant setting. as we all know, the united nations is the ideal forum for exchanging our respective experiences and to maintain our solidarity. in such circumstances, allow me first of all to express my heartfelt thanks to miguel descoto brockmann for the excellent way in which he led the sixty-third session of our general assembly, which allowed us to make progress on various current issues that are necessary and useful for the fulfilment of humanity as a whole. allow me, furthermore, to present my warm congratulations on the election of ali treki as president of the sixty-fourth session of the general assembly. i am certain that this august assembly will adopt pertinent resolutions and decisions under his clear-sighted leadership. i also wish to salute you, mr. secretary-general, for your exceptional and visible ability to react in response to all the crises troubling the world. i can only wish you the greatest success in accomplishing your missions. this years theme, global response to global crises and development through strengthening multilateralism and dialogue of civilizations perfectly reflects the desire of us all to find a common solution to our common problems. our cultural, religious or other differences should in no way constitute a factor in lack of understanding among us, the peoples of this world. on the contrary, they should provide even greater impetus to guide us towards durable peace and security. indeed, our differences lie in the way in which each of us approaches realities, being and events. the resulting points of view are partial, and thus necessarily complement each other. i join with african leaders in affirming that africa deserves its place in the community of nations. i also share the view that the common value of democracy we all proclaim would be meaningless if geographical representation were not applied within this organization. it is a matter of the very legitimacy of the united nations. as the worlds second most populous continent, africa should not be excluded from initiatives that concern it. a/64/470 09-53756 4 we support the demand of the president of the african union and several member states to grant it the right to a permanent seat on the united nations security council with all the associated prerogatives. we are here to mark the way for future generations and to make concrete our desire to promote dialogue among cultures and civilizations. let us hold fast to the principles we unanimously adopted in the universal declaration of human rights that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood. allow me to salute all the efforts undertaken to date, at all levels of our international community, for this cause that is dear to us. nevertheless, much remains to be done, for we are still far from achieving our objectives. understanding, rejection of discrimination, and tolerance, religious or otherwise, without which a durable peace will remain a utopian ideal, must be the watchwords in guiding our actions. they must be our reference points in each decision we take, whether in the political, economic, social or cultural fields. in that regard, allow me briefly to examine the case of my country, madagascar, whose situation, it appears to me, embodies a model of society where we, the youth, must take on an increasingly important role in all decision-making processes. sixty-five per cent of the population of madagascar is under 25 years of age, which is roughly the proportion of youth throughout the world, especially in developing countries. the world is in the process of searching for a reference point to survive the major challenges it is facing, in particular the economic and financial crisis, climate change, food insecurity and growing poverty. in madagascar, these problems, combined with failed governance over the past two decades, inevitably resulted in an acute political and social crisis. the malagasy experience speaks to us all, for the youth of madagascar have taken responsibility. being among the youngest heads of state present at this general assembly, if not the youngest, i formally call on all the youth of the world to take action against the new challenges facing humanity. let us act in order not to suffer, and change for a better, sustainable world! i also appeal to our elders to have confidence in the youth of today and of tomorrow. and i thank the secretary-general for the relevance of his initiative at his climate change conference, when he involved youth in this struggle for the survival of humanity. we are speaking out to the whole world because: we have waited too long for our opportunity to choose; we have waited too long to attack injustice, the poverty of our countrymen, abuse and drift; a/64/470 5 09-53756 we have waited too long to find real solutions to poor governance which has mired much of humanity in poverty. to suffering, anguish and despair, we must have one response: we want to change, we must change, we will change. this is not the first time in 49 years of independence that the malagasy people have manifested their will for change. the peaceful movement of the malagasy people led to the establishment of a transitional authority validated by the high constitutional court of the republic of madagascar. unfortunately, some technical and financial partners are threatening sanctions of various types. we can only regret such threats, which will serve only to increase the suffering of the malagasy people, for madagascar still depends on international assistance, and in the end its beneficiaries are the people and not governments. therefore, from this rostrum, we solemnly appeal to the international community, to all donors, to review their reading of the situation and to continue their assistance to the malagasy people in order to prevent further deterioration in their standard of living. the principal mission of the transition regime, which is consensual and inclusive, is to draft a new constitution for the advent of the fourth republic in line with the expectations of the malagasy people. the major principles of this new constitution will be laid down during a national conference to be organized and conducted by civil society. we would like to state our commitment to the holding of free, fair, transparent and regular elections as early as possible, on the basis of a new electoral code under the supervision of the independent electoral commission and monitored by international observers. we greatly hope that the united nations will accompany us through this electoral process. we request your assistance and support. looking towards the international year for the rapprochement of cultures in 2010, the malagasy people call for international cooperation in favour of all initiatives aimed at promoting a culture of peace and dialogue among all cultures, civilizations and religions. this choice is eminently meaningful as the current crises remind us that all countries of the world are called on to cooperate, especially because of interdependence related to globalization, and that a spirit of dialogue must prevail. dialogue assumes equality and mutual respect. thus, all points of view and proposed solutions deserve to be considered for their worth in order to address the complex crises which are currently raging across our planet. in other words, effective multilateralism through international organizations is at stake, and ideological eclecticism as well as methodological realism must be brought to bear. a/64/470 09-53756 6 dialogue also requires a spirit of burden-sharing. from this viewpoint, since crises have universal impact, recovery should benefit all and associated strategies must be impartial. as long as some peoples and actors of the world are underestimated and even excluded, effectiveness will miss the mark. the promises made at the international conferences on the economic, financial, food and climate crises must be kept. among them, i would like to cite the promise to allocate 0.7 per cent of the economic recovery plans adopted in rich countries to respond to the immediate needs of peoples suffering from hunger and malnutrition and to guarantee food security for all. madagascar is grateful for the support of the international community in its efforts for peace and development, and reaffirms its determination to contribute to our collective reflections in order to solve shared problems. may the dialogue of civilizations prosper all the nations through a gentler, more humane globalization!",Madagascar,Africa,64.4809112548828,2.825129985809326,1426.0,9.0,0.0,9.0,6.311360448807854
ZAF,64,2009,"this year marks the twentieth anniversary of the adoption, in 1989, of general assembly resolution 44/27 a, on international solidarity with the liberation struggle in south africa. that was one of numerous assembly resolutions in which the nations of the world pledged their support for the eradication of apartheid. within months of the adoption of that important resolution, the ban on south african liberation movements was lifted. nelson mandela and other political prisoners were released. the stage was thus 09-52228 20 set for the negotiations that would eventually lead to the achievement of freedom and democracy in our country. the role of the united nations in the struggle to end apartheid is an exceptional example of the collective political will of the international community. it represented the victory of unity over division and of negotiation over confrontation. it represented a clear commitment to the promotion of basic human rights. as south africans, we will always be grateful for that international solidarity. since the advent of democracy in 1994, we have built a solid, stable democracy, founded on the principles of unity, non-sexism, non-racialism and democracy. as we continue to build our young nation, we are cognizant of the need for a conducive international environment. for that reason, we are committed to playing our part, with the rest of the international community, in taking forward the fight against poverty and in responding to the crises that are confronting the world today. we must act now, together, to halt the degradation of the environment. we must act now, together, to prevent the global economic crisis from undoing the gains that we have achieved over decades. the eradication of poverty must remain central to the work of the united nations. the organization must continue to work harder to unite the world to work to alleviate the suffering of the worlds poor and marginalized. the global economic meltdown has dealt a heavy blow to world efforts to eradicate poverty. but it should not diminish our resolve. the united nations must play a significant role in finding solutions to the global economic crisis. the crisis should not be an excuse to delay further action on the delivery of the millennium development goals. rather, it should urge us to double our efforts to achieve greater and faster progress. developing countries did not cause the economic crisis, but they are severely affected by it. the crisis has further highlighted the urgent need for fundamental reform of the bretton woods institutions, including their mandate, scope, governance and responsiveness. these institutions have been unrepresentative since their formation half a century ago. the current arrangements are inadequate and unfair. they do not reflect the changes that have taken place in the global economy. we should ensure that the election of the heads of all those institutions is more democratic, and opens opportunities to developing countries. the emerging and developing countries, including the poorest, must have a greater voice and greater participation in those institutions. similarly, if we are to eradicate poverty there is an urgent need to conclude the doha round of trade negotiations in a manner that prioritizes development. we continue to work for an african renewal, and welcome the ongoing support of the united nations system in addressing the challenges facing the continent. now more than ever, it is necessary for the united nations to ensure that the international community collectively implements the commitments made to africa. we have a viable socio-economic development blueprint, the new partnership for africas development, which should be used in mobilizing resources for africa. we appreciate that there can be no lasting peace without development, and no development without security. over the past 20 years, africa has made much progress in working to end conflicts and to promote democratic practices and institutions. however, some pockets of conflict persist. for its part, south africa has been engaged in mediation, conflict prevention and peacekeeping on the continent, in, among other places, burundi, zimbabwe and the democratic republic of the congo. the african union has the political will to resolve conflicts on the continent. however, it lacks resources to run effective peacekeeping interventions and conflict prevention mechanisms. we appeal for support for african peacemaking efforts, and for greater cooperation between the united nations and the african union. in this regard, we call on the general assembly to align itself with resolutions of the african union and the southern african development community that do not recognize governments that come into power by force or other unconstitutional means. the search for global peace, stability and security cannot be separated from the pursuit of justice, self-determination, human rights and economic development. we need to constantly reaffirm the inalienable human rights of all people. we call for the full and effective implementation of the outcomes of the world conference against racism and the subsequent durban review conference. it is of 21 09-52228 concern that at the close of the first decade of the twenty-first century there are still nations that find their lands occupied and their peoples oppressed. we are convinced that urgent and concrete steps are needed to resolve the situation in western sahara. we must work with similar urgency towards the achievement, through negotiations, of peaceful coexistence between israelis and palestinians. this must be based on the creation of a viable palestinian state, existing side by side with israel, within the 1967 borders, which must be secure and internationally recognized. we also call for the lifting of the economic, commercial and financial embargo on cuba. we also appreciate the recent pronouncements by some nuclear-weapon states on their intention to reduce their nuclear arsenals. let us take up this new momentum and utilize the opportunity of the 2010 review conference of the parties to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons (npt) to recommit ourselves to the full implementation of obligations under the npt. we should ensure a balance among the objectives of disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. for africa, the impact of climate change is devastating and will severely undermine development and poverty eradication efforts. we need to act now to ensure that there is an inclusive, fair and effective global agreement on this critical challenge. the agreement must recognize that solving the climate problem cannot be separated from the struggle to eradicate poverty. developed countries bear the greatest responsibility for climate change and its impact. we must therefore strike a balance between adaptation and mitigation. our goal should be to significantly reduce emissions across the globe without constraining development in the countries of the south. ms. mcclean (barbados), vice-president, took the chair. developed countries must make ambitious, quantified and legally binding emission reduction commitments that are in line with science and that address their historical responsibilities. at copenhagen, there needs to be agreement on new, additional, sustainable and predictable financing for adaptation. this should be for programmes that reduce the vulnerability of developing countries to the effects of climate change. in a world that is increasingly interconnected and interdependent, international problems can be resolved effectively only through multilateral cooperation. the united nations must continue to be at the centre of multilateralism, but it needs to be reformed if it is to carry out its mandate effectively, efficiently and transparently. we remain committed to the view that no reform of the united nations can be complete without the fundamental reform of the security council. it must be representative of the international community and reflect the geopolitical realities of today. if the security council is not reformed and does not have permanent representation for africa, the legitimacy of the councils decisions will continue to be questioned. south africa continues to advocate an expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories of membership. let me express our appreciation to the world for the celebration of the inaugural nelson mandela day on 18 july this year. scores of people engaged in a minimum of 67 minutes of voluntary action in the service of humanity, in honour of our icon, president mandela. the non-aligned movement has joined the call for this general assembly to declare 18 july nelson mandela day. this would be in recognition of president mandelas contribution to the struggle for democracy and the cause of humanity, and to promote community service across the globe. in this regard, we hope that the general assembly will adopt a consensus resolution in support of nelson mandela day. south africa is privileged to host the 2010 federation internationale de football association world cup in the middle of next year, which will be the first time that the tournament has been held on african soil. we look forward to hosting the peoples of the world, who will enjoy unique african hospitality and vibrancy. i wish to take this opportunity to thank the outgoing president of the general assembly for

MAR,64,2009,"on behalf of the kingdom of morocco, i should like to congratulate you warmly, sir, on your election to the presidency of the general-assembly of the united nations at its sixty- fourth session. we are proud to see a son of a brotherly country from our region at the helm of this universal body. you may rest assured that our delegation is prepared fully to support your endeavours aimed at ensuring a greater role for our organization in meeting the challenges of todays world. i wish also to seize this opportunity to express our appreciation and support to his excellency secretary-general ban ki-moon for his tireless efforts not only to realize the objectives for which our organization was created, but also to enable the organization to fulfil the aspirations of the peoples of the world in the course of this third millennium. the global crises, owing to their universal impact, multifaceted nature and wide implications, have given additional impetus to our collective action and strengthened coordination among the different constituents of this universal body. today, the world is facing recurrent and unprecedented crises in the fields of economics, finance, food and energy that have shaken the foundations of universal governance. these crises have also adversely affected the socio-economic and environmental systems of all states, especially in developing countries. as the most representative organization in the world, the united nations embodies the living conscience of the international community. as such, it is the most appropriate forum for coordinated joint action and for the reactivation of collective initiatives in order to analyse the root causes of such crises and contain their impact through the adoption of agreed solutions likely to mitigate their effects. effective and 09-52586 50 fair economic governance is dependent on the revitalization of the multilateral system based on realism, efficiency and innovation as a means of finding solutions that reflect the aspirations and hopes of present and future generations. the millennium development goals (mdgs) were adopted as a common platform for action with clear objectives and a time frame for their implementation, with a view to achieving human development in the world. much progress has been achieved in many states thanks to the efforts of the international community since the millennium summit. however, the progress made towards those goals has not been consistent or steady within states or among states in general. the negative implications of the current economic crisis may exacerbate those disparities, especially in africa. the few years that remain before 2015 thus require us to adopt a coordinated global approach and to build real partnerships in order to mobilize additional financial resources in line with the commitments made in the monterrey consensus and the doha declaration on financing for development as well as in the declarations of the group of eight and the group of 20. in this context, morocco hopes that the fourth high-level meeting on financing for development, to be held in november 2009 in new york, will yield results commensurate with the expectations of the developing countries, thus giving new impetus to efforts to attain the millennium development goals, thus leading to the formation of an international alliance for african development in the framework of coordinated efforts and initiatives aimed at achieving the goals within specific time frames. we also hope that the united nations agencies that are active in the area of development will mainstream the millennium development goals and use them as the main and appropriate framework for their action. in this context, the united nations development programme (undp) in particular should use the millennium development goals as practical and comprehensively agreed upon indicators when drafting its report on human development. the mdgs provide a practical and qualitative, not only quantitative, way to measure living that better reflects the ever-evolving concept of development. in keeping with this vision, the national initiative for human development, launched in may 2005 by his majesty mohammed vi, constitutes a pillar of moroccan social policy. the initiative is based on an integrated approach to development in all its aspects political, economic, social, environmental and cultural. by building roads, providing energy services and encouraging income-generating activities, the initiative has achieved concrete results in fighting poverty and exclusion, improving infrastructure and de-marginalizing rural areas. collective efforts in the field of development will remain insufficient unless they are accompanied by daring and effective policies for the protection of the environment and concrete measures to mitigate the impact of climate change, which now more than ever is threatening the future of mankind. in that connection, morocco is convinced that the conference on climate change to be held in copenhagen in december will undoubtedly constitute an important step towards an international agreement on climate. in that regard, morocco reiterates the proposal it made at the conference held at poznan, poland, in december 2008 for the creation of a multilateral fund for the transfer of technology to the developing countries in order to enable them to deal with the grave implications of climate change. mindful of the necessity to operationalize concrete measures to protect the environment and contain the negative impact of climate change, his majesty mohammed vi instructed the government to draft swiftly a comprehensive national environmental charter, with the aim of protecting national resources and reserves as part of a sustainable development policy. the environment should be considered a shared national heritage whose protection is the collective duty of current and future generations. likewise, morocco will reactivate its national energy strategy aimed at the development of renewable energy sources and the recycling of waste water. convinced that the peace process is the only viable option in the middle east, the kingdom of morocco has participated constructively and responsibly in all efforts of the international community to relaunch the peace process on solid foundations. that means that the process must be in accordance with resolutions of international legality, the previous relevant agreements and commitments among the parties concerned, and the arab peace initiative, which as a realistic option reflects the collective arab will to arrive at a just and comprehensive solution that guarantees the right of the 51 09-52586 palestinian people to create their own independent state, with al-quds al-sharif as its capital, an israeli withdrawal from all occupied arab territories, including syrian and lebanese territories, and a stable, secure and peaceful existence for all peoples of the region. the kingdom of morocco expresses its appreciation to the united states administration for its efforts and for the encouraging positions taken by president obama. we hope that it will persevere in order to overcome obstacles to a resumption of negotiations. we also commend all other international efforts, including european efforts, to that end. those efforts will be productive only if israel halts its illegal practices, which prevent the achievement of peace. those practices, in particular the building of settlements in the occupied palestinian territories and the unjust blockade against our brotherly palestinian people, run counter to the peace option. the settlement activities and the expulsions taking place in al-quds, aimed at altering the legal and demographic status of that holy city, are flagrant violations of international instruments and require urgent action on the part of all peace-loving countries. in that regard, his majesty mohammed vi, in his capacity as chairman of the al-quds committee, has always warned the international community against the risks associated with altering the legal status of al-quds. he has also been urging the influential international powers to swiftly implement the requirements of international legitimacy in order to preserve the religious, cultural and spiritual features of the holy city in such a way as to create appropriate conditions conducive to the resumption of the peace process. the achievement of peace through the peaceful resolution of conflicts is the essence of the historical mandate of the united nations. it should be based on the principles of equality among states and respect for their independence and territorial integrity, in accordance with the charter of the united nations. in addition, there is a need to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction and to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. as a member of the peacebuilding commission, morocco will continue its relevant activities, including by mobilizing efforts in support of african countries. such efforts are being made within the framework of south-south cooperation, with concrete projects, defined goals and shared benefits and in keeping with the priorities of moroccan foreign policy as determined by his majesty king mohammed vi. as one of the first active participants in united nations peacekeeping missions, morocco has always taken a keen interest in united nations efforts to enhance such operations as part of the new partnership proposed to adapt to international developments and the requirements for lasting peace. furthermore, recent developments in the area of disarmament provide reason for optimism. the positions expressed and the statements made at the highest levels augur well and maintain the momentum for disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. we hope that efforts will be made at the international and regional levels for the entry into force of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty, given the outcome of the meeting on article 14 of the treaty, which i had the honour to co-chair last thursday with my colleague, the minister for foreign affairs of france. since its establishment, the united nations has endeavoured to promote international and regional cooperation to uphold the principles of coexistence, peace, good-neighbourliness and consultation at a time when regional economic gatherings are playing a pivotal role in addressing economic, security and environmental issues. convinced of that role, morocco has taken a keen interest in promoting good- neighbourly relations in nearby african, maghreb and mediterranean regions. likewise, morocco supports the mediterranean union as a promising framework for increasing dialogue and cooperation between the two sides of the mediterranean. moreover, on 4 august 2009, mindful of the important role of the atlantic ocean and the opportunities it provides for collective action, morocco launched an initiative aimed at cooperation among african countries bordering the atlantic as the basis for a broader partnership with other coastal countries in that geo-strategic region. his majesty king mohammad vi has reaffirmed moroccos strong and enduring resolve to contribute in good faith to the consolidation of the arab maghreb union, the reactivation of its structures and the strengthening of relations among its members, including brotherly algeria. indeed, that regional body could play a central role in building fruitful partnerships and in ensuring security and stability in 09-52586 52 africa, the middle east and the mediterranean. our belief that the arab maghreb project must be reactivated as an embodiment of our peoples hopes and aspirations is in keeping with our sincere desire to work to remove all obstacles to the realization of our peoples expectations and the consolidation of brotherly relations among its five members. in that regard, morocco has responded responsibly and in good faith to the appeals of the security council for efforts to find a political, lasting and negotiated solution to the regional dispute over the moroccan sahara. a bold autonomy initiative, regarded as serious and credible by the international community, has been proposed as a promising and realistic basis for a lasting solution to that artificial conflict. with the same resolve and responsibility, morocco, with the support of the security council, has been engaged in the new dynamic resulting from its initiative aimed at negotiations under united nations supervision. in its resolutions 1813 (2008) and 1871 (2009), the council called for serious and intense negotiations in a spirit of compromise and realism with a view to finding a political, lasting and negotiated solution that is in keeping with the principle of self-determination and that cannot be monopolized by anyone or selectively interpreted to conceal undeclared objectives and a hidden agenda. morocco will continue its full cooperation with the secretary-general and his personal envoy to find a definitive solution to this regional dispute that fully respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the kingdom of morocco and grants autonomous status to the population of the sahara provinces, which is likely to ensure their progress and well-being and enable them to manage their domestic affairs in a democratic manner. the kingdom of morocco has always been at the forefront of international and regional initiatives aimed at promoting the values of dialogue, tolerance and openness to others, especially as they relate to the necessary dialogue between islam and the west and to respecting universal human rights standards, as prevalent as they are all over the world. based on those convictions, morocco will continue to promote its fruitful cooperation and positive dialogue at the bilateral, regional and global levels. motivated by the same spirit of commitment, the kingdom of morocco will assume its responsibility and will play its role fully within the main united nations bodies, with a view to reinforcing the organizations efficiency, credibility and contribution. may the blessings, peace and mercy of allah be upon all participants.",Morocco,Africa,56.0836715698242,4.83119010925293,2151.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.8596001859600186
SEN,64,2009,"we are meeting once again, but this time at a moment when humankind is facing many problems, each as difficult as the others, as if they had been planned to coincide: the agriculture crisis, the financial and economic crisis, environmental peril and tenacious, deadly diseases. be that as it may, we are destined to prevail. there is simply no other option. we must and we can succeed. the numerous deliberations about these problems at all levels illustrate our increasing awareness of the dangers to us and succeeding generations. believing fundamentally as i do in the genius of humankind and its capacity for imagination and creativity in extricating itself from the most difficult situations, i am both optimistic and aware of the price that will have to be paid. this is what we are called on to do here and elsewhere. the only question is how to coordinate the numerous elements required to expedite the rescue mission. before going any further, however, i should like warmly to congratulate mr. ali abdussalam treki, who has been charged with guiding the work of this sixty- fourth session of the general assembly. i have known mr. treki for a long time, and senegal is delighted by his election and expresses its confidence in his human and professional qualities, which will bolster the success of his mission. i also pay tribute to mr. miguel descoto brockmann, president of the general assembly at its sixty-third session, for his contributions to the effort to revitalize the assembly. his commitment and dynamism are well known. i have admired his intelligence, his lively wit and the sensitivity he shows in his relations with others. to secretary-general ban ki-moon, senegal reiterates its support for his delicate task in the face of the many and urgent issues facing the organization. this sixty-fourth session of the general assembly has begun at a time of multifaceted turmoil. the economic and financial crisis, the scale of which has surprised many observers, reveals above all the deadlock in contemporary economic theory. in highlighting the inadequacy of our analytical and predictive abilities, it calls for a broader sense of shared responsibility both for the management of its immediate effects and for the search for long-term responses. in seeking solutions, let us be careful not to make the mistake of falling back on received wisdom and ready-made answers. be it in the sphere of the environment, political and economic governance or development, the world must find a new way of thinking and acting, and thereby address the need to change our outlook. having myself argued, often strongly, for the full participation of africa in the conversation on world governance, i welcome the progressively expanded cooperative framework of the group of eight (g-8) and the group of 20 (g-20). i only regret that my proposal to establish a shadow g-20, made up of the 41 09-52425 worlds greatest experts but open to all those who bring new ideas, has not yet been put into practice. the president returned to the chair. clearly, the worlds heads of state, elected on the basis of political criteria, cannot miraculously transform themselves into universal polymaths. they must hold to their political and even strategic role, and rely on the superior knowledge of experts. it is through dialogue open to all that we will be able to grasp the diversity of our respective situations and apply real- world answers to real-world problems. it is therefore fitting that the theme of this sixty-fourth session should be effective responses to global crises: strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace, security and development. the current challenges, both complex and global in nature, call strongly for innovative and concerted solutions if we are to succeed. that is especially true for problems of agriculture and food security. if we are to achieve on schedule millennium development goal 1, to halve by 2015 the number of people suffering from hunger, we must put into practice a different approach to international cooperation, one based on support for agriculture instead of food assistance, which should be used only as an emergency response to exceptional circumstances. the development of agriculture to promote sustainable food security in africa necessarily involves water management, the availability of equipment, producers access to inputs and a sound organization of chains of production, storage, processing and sales of agricultural products. that is why senegal hopes that these essential questions and others, such as the regulation of agricultural markets and scientific research to increase productivity will take a prominent place on the agenda of the summit of the worlds regions on food security, to be held in january 2010 in dakar, and of the global partnership for agriculture and food security proposed by the g-8. once the right conditions are in place, there is no reason why africa should not be able to ensure its own food security. better yet, its enormous land and water resources predispose the continent to become the worlds breadbasket. to that end, however, we must avoid the vicious trap of ceding land to foreigners bearing millions of dollars. the g-8 quite rightly expressed its concern on this subject at its most recent summit in italy. according to recent estimates, between 15 and 20 million hectares have changed hands over the past three years, primarily in africa. we africans should make it our vocation to become farmers tilling our own land rather than being agricultural labourers working for capital-rich foreign planters. for its part, senegal, as i have often said, cannot accept such a course, which would without doubt empty our countryside of newly impoverished millions, who would swell our slums and the ranks of those ripe for illegal emigration. on the other hand, if we exploit our mutually complementary circumstances, we of the north and the south can promote a win-win partnership in which investors and local communities join to develop african land without dispossession. senegal has succeeded, in record time, in responding positively to the food crisis. for the second year in a row, our home-grown agricultural campaign for food and abundance, known as goana, has rewarded us with excellent results. we intend to strengthen this food self-sufficiency option with the unionization of rural producers, on the model of quebec. to this end, we are currently setting up a green bank for farmers, fishers and livestock farmers, which will support financing of these sectors. this is a bold innovation, a green revolution that we want very much to see succeed. at the global level, i believe that, beyond its adverse impacts, the current crisis has a silver lining insofar as it stimulates creativity, initiative and a fighting spirit. if the secretary-general had not launched his emotional appeal at world food day in rome two years ago, i might not have felt a challenge so great as to demand the invention of goana. and because the fate of our people is at stake, it is our primary responsibility to establish on our own the conditions necessary for a brighter future. internal efforts will continue to be futile without a healthy global environment rid of the speculative practices of the virtual economy and unjust asymmetric programmes, such as subsidies and other inequitable practices. in this context, non-oil-producing african countries continue to feel the full brunt of the increase in oil prices resulting from speculative practices that we cannot mitigate because they are controlled by the oil oligarchy. economies such as ours, which had hitherto posted average growth rates of 5 per cent, have been brutally weakened by imported inflation. 09-52425 42 for that reason, senegal supports and encourages the dialogue between producers and consumers initiated by the international energy forum to improve transparency in the oil market and take effective measures against speculative practices that devastate the economies of importing states. in implementing the wade formula, i proposed a fund to fight poverty funded by voluntary contributions from african oil-producing states and oil companies working in africa, based on the principle of shared social responsibility. the fund could be managed collectively or entrusted to the world bank. similarly, i welcome the extension of the exogenous shocks facility to countries benefiting from the policy support instrument. the summit meeting on climate change confirmed a broadly shared conclusion. if we do not change our methods of production and consumption, the future of mankind itself will be in peril. we must admit that we have not taken sufficient action to reverse these negative trends. nature subjects us daily to the adverse consequences of our own attacks against it in different ways, including floods, droughts, desertification and coastal erosion. these upheavals foreshadow even more devastating phenomena. international consensus is therefore urgently needed to save the planet. in order to survive, each of us must strive to behave more respectfully towards the environment and to create a world with fewer greenhouse gas emissions. according to the hopeful statement of the secretary-general, we now find ourselves on the threshold of a new era that of the green economy. let us have the courage to cross the threshold for ourselves and for succeeding generations. africa for its part wishes to assume its share of responsibility in this necessary environmental rebirth. that is the essence of the great green wall project that runs from dakar to djibouti. shared by all countries it runs through, the great green wall is 7,000 kilometres long and 15 kilometres wide, and senegal has the responsibility of coordinating it on behalf of the african union. with the assistance of experts from all over the world, we have selected plants adapted to the fairly arid conditions prevailing in the sahelian-saharan zone. at the same time, we have decided to build water-collection basins along the entire length of the great green wall, based on the model that we have implemented in senegal with some 250 basins. every african state involved in the construction of the great green wall organizes its implementation at the local level through a national agency. at the continental level, national agencies are coordinated by a pan- african great green wall agency under the auspices of the african union. i cherish the hope that the united nations will become involved in this project, which contributes to protecting the global environment, by mobilizing what might be called anti-desert soldiers along the lines of peacekeeping troops. here, i pay tribute to the participation of ivorian boys and girls who, although not directly impacted by desertification cote divoire being a country of forests spontaneously participated in building the senegalese section of the great green wall in senegal. they worked voluntarily, side by side with their comrades from senegal. these young people, transcending the artificial borders created by colonization, are using self-determination to take ownership of the struggle for africas future. this experience could serve as a prelude to the creation of a broad movement of youth without borders that unites young africans from throughout the continent. they could be the heralds of various causes, such as the fight against hiv/aids, early marriage and female circumcision, as they in senegal. while we await foreign assistance, senegal has already built nearly 527 kilometres of the great green wall. the project is also under way in mali, and chad will follow in the near future. through the progressive restoration of the saharan ecosystem, the great green wall will contribute through greenhouse gas sequestration to the global fight against global warming. i thank the european union for its pledged support, and i welcome in particular president sarkozys initiative to deploy to this front the only worthy front soldiers to plant trees and build water-collection basins. i cherish the hope that this initiative will serve to inspire other states with the necessary human and material resources to support the great green wall. given the severity of the situation, the environmental threat, in my opinion, should be considered a threat to international peace and security. if it were, we might consider allocating new international missions to national armies. in the manner of peacekeeping operations, senegal proposes 43 09-52425 the creation of a mechanism to save and restore the environment based on the voluntary commitment of armies through modalities to be determined. in the framework of civilian and military activities, countries wishing to do so could mobilize contingents for specific periods to assist in implementing major environmental projects, such as the great green wall, or what is referred to in senegal as the atlantic wall against coastal erosion. in senegal, we are currently creating along our coastline a concrete wall 3 to 4 metres deep and 40 centimetres wide built on an impermeable foundation to stop the maritime erosion that threatens many african countries. its effectiveness is guaranteed. the only problem is the cost $1.5 million per kilometre. from casablanca to cotonou, representing some 5,000 kilometres of vulnerable coastline, the overall cost would be $7.5 billion. compared to expenditures often seen at the global level, it certainly is not much. moreover, if mankind were to stop building lethal weapons for only three months and allocate the money thus saved to building the atlantic wall, the threat to that part of africa would be permanently removed. for 16 years now, security council reform has been an important item on our agenda. it is a paradox that an organization, universal in its mission, should remain deadlocked 64 years after its creation by the elitist nature of its principal body. the leader al-qadhafi summarized our position on that issue (see ). as africa is the only continent not represented among the permanent members, despite the fact that its the focus of 70 per cent of the councils work, that historic injustice must be corrected by granting the continent here and now, outside the context of overall reform, one seat with the right of veto that could be held by the chairman-in-office of the african union. let us ensure that this session is the one at which we finally solve the issue of security council reform so that we can focus our efforts on other important issues. those important issues still unfortunately include the tragic situation in the middle east. while it recognizes the israeli peoples right to live in peace within secure and internationally recognized borders, senegal resolutely supports the just and legitimate claim of the palestinian people to a viable, free and independent state. that claim is morally consonant with the right of peoples to self-determination. however, in general, senegal rejects violence in all its forms, whatever its origin. israels pursuit of illegal activities on palestinian territory is counterproductive. the settlement, expropriation and lockdown of the territories are a serious obstacle to the negotiations process and delay the prospects of an era of peace for all peoples of the subregion. senegal supports the vision of two states, israeli and palestinian, as recalled here yesterday by president barack obama (see ). turning to the situation in africa, senegal welcomes the considerable progress made in the peaceful settlement of disputes and in the integration process towards establishing the united states of africa. the accomplishment of african unity is the only viable answer to the challenges of globalization, the creation of large groupings and the redefinition of the rules of governance. it is also an essential condition for the establishment of lasting peace and stability on the continent. senegal continues to contribute to the settlement of disputes in africa on the basis of that ideal of peace. i therefore welcome the normalization of the situation in our sister republic of mauritania following the dakar accord of june 2009. we should remember that the accord was concluded with the support of the international contact group throughout the negotiation process. i reiterate my congratulations and my appreciation to all. in the sister republic of guinea-bissau, i welcome the gradual return to stability after the presidential elections, recognized and acknowledged by all as free and transparent. as a neighbour, senegal reiterates its call for the convening of a donor conference in support of the courageous stabilization and development efforts of the people of guinea- bissau, through their new authorities. on the other hand, the situation in the republic of guinea seems to me of greater concern. that country merits our full attention because it could fall into violence at any time. mrs. ellen johnson-sirleaf, president of liberia, and i, in our capacity as goodwill neighbours, were in conakry only two weeks ago. i reported back to the african union, stressing the need for an ongoing presence in the field and for a dialogue with all stakeholders, including the army. in my view, 09-52425 44 that is the only way to help restore the constitutional order in guinea. the ideal of peace, the primary raison detre of our organization, remains seriously threatened by extremism of all stripes, fuelled and perpetuated by ignorance, mistrust and the manipulation of religion. the need for dialogue between cultures and civilizations is all the more urgent on that account. the challenge today, in particular for the three revealed religions that share the same god, is to build on that common monotheistic pedestal a bridge of brotherhood that brings us closer and teaches us to live together again by sharing our common values and with respect for our differences. as chairman-in-office of the organization of the islamic conference, i reiterate once again the dedication of the islamic ummah to dialogue for the mutual understanding and peaceful coexistence of peoples because islam, in letter and spirit, is a religion of the happy medium and of peace that teaches, in all things, knowledge, moderation, reasonableness and respect for the freedom of worship. let us all agree to strive to learn to better understand each other, overcome mistrust and fight the obscurantist ideas that give rise to tensions and confrontation. a world living in peace in the twenty- first century will be one in which all peoples enjoy an equally dignified existence. in that spirit, senegal will host the third world festival of negro arts from 1 to 15 december 2010. that artistic and intellectual event, with brazil as guest of honour, will provide the opportunity for africa and its diaspora to celebrate the values of culture and civilization of the black world. for us, that is a way to fight the prejudices that still haunt some malicious minds and fuel the re-emergence of revisionist ideas. africa is ready to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century in a spirit of openness and dialogue with all peoples for a world of peace and human brotherhood.",Senegal,Africa,48.0367813110352,4.920730113983154,3082.0,7.0,0.0,7.0,2.2712524334847504
TGO,64,2009,"at the outset, allow me to convey the warm greetings of the head of state, government and people of togo on the occasion of the sixty-fourth session of the general assembly. i also wish to add that the minister for foreign affairs of togo, who unfortunately is absent from new york, asked me to read out the following statement : from this rostrum, where the leaders of the entire planet have expressed their views on the major questions of the time, i should in turn like to share with this assembly the following ideas, prompted by the developments in our world over the past 12 months. before performing this duty, however, i wish to convey to you, sir, the warm congratulations of the government and the people of togo on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the general assembly at this session. i can assure you of my delegations willingness to work with you to carry out your mandate, the success of which will do honour to africa and in particular to your country, the libyan arab jamahiriya, with which togo maintains friendly relations of solidarity and cooperation. also i wish to convey to your predecessor, father miguel descoto brockmann, my congratulations on his work and in particular for the commendable initiatives he undertook throughout his mandate to restore the general assembly to its due place and role under the united nations charter. to his excellency secretary-general ban ki-moon, i convey our 35 09-53165 congratulations for the dynamic and pragmatic manner with which he has guided our organization. i hereby forcefully reaffirm togos full adherence to the ideals of peace, security and development that are at the centre of the priorities of our organization. my country also endorses the approaches adopted by our organization in recent years to further sustainable development by promoting peace and security and by mobilizing international solidarity in the economic, social and cultural arenas. political, administrative and economic governance remains essential to the consolidation of peace and security in our countries and undoubtedly helps to speed up achievement of the millennium development goals. however, no harmonious and lasting development is possible without a climate of peace and national concord. that is why the government of togo spares no effort to create conditions conducive to bold reforms and to lay the foundations for a new republican pact and national reconciliation. indeed, since 2005, the government, under the guidance of the head of state, has worked tirelessly for a policy of openness, the promotion of democracy, the strengthening of the rule of law and the reduction of poverty. a number of reforms have been undertaken in this regard, especially in the political, constitutional, institutional and socio-economic areas. politically, the head of state has engaged in dialogue as an instrument of political consensus. this approach, based on a politics of complete openness, culminated in the signing in august 2006 of the global political accord, which in turn led to the formation of a government of national unity, facilitated by his excellency blaise compaore, president of burkina faso. i recall that the implementation of the global political accord and the 22 commitments undertaken with the european union led to the holding of free and democratic legislative elections in october 2007, which were welcomed unanimously by the international community. in the same spirit, a truth, justice and reconciliation commission has been set up, the members of which were appointed on 29 may 2009. its purpose is to shed light on the political acts of violence that occurred in togo between 1958 and 2005 in order once and for all to banish impunity from our country and to reconcile the people of togo with their history. with regard to constitutional reform, significant progress has been made. in august, the national assembly adopted a law modifying the electoral code, relaxing the eligibility conditions for presidential elections, and allowing for the establishment of a national independent electoral commission and its reconfiguration in order to adapt it to current political realities. at the same time, discussions of certain questions continue with the firm resolve of the government to carry out the rest of the reforms on the basis of consensus, since we have made concerted action and dialogue the foundation of our political action in togo. in the institutional area, we have striven to reconstitute the constitutional court, the national human rights commission and the high authority for audiovisual and communication. similarly, the government of togo has established a court of audits and adopted statutes for the army, the security forces and the opposition. it has also made arrangements for the public financing of political parties and the organs of the private press. as concerns the judiciary, our vast modernization programme of the judicial system continues in a satisfactory manner, with a view to involving the people more closely in the administration of justice. in this regard, the government has taken measures to guarantee citizens freedom of expression, for example, by decriminalizing press offences. furthermore, to demonstrate its desire to respect human dignity and defend human rights, our government submitted to the national assembly a bill abolishing the death penalty. this law, adopted unanimously on 24 june, is the outcome of a constitutional provision that requires the state to guarantee the physical and mental integrity, life and security of all persons living on our national territory. the efforts undertaken by the government in the areas of health, education and employment, particularly for young people, have also seen 09-53165 36 considerable progress. in the field of health, we have established a national health development plan for the years 2009 to 2013, at a cost of 317 billion cfa francs, reflecting the will of the togolese government to respond effectively to our peoples health needs. with regard to education, togos educational system has suffered from the financial constraints afflicting the country for the past 15 years due to the suspension of cooperation. this situation, compounded by a high demand for education, has resulted in a decline in teaching conditions and serious structural problems. in the face of these constraints, the government has committed to establish a sectoral education plan that will allow the country to launch a fast-track initiative in 2010 to ensure education for all. to put a new face on public administration and make it a genuine instrument for the reconstruction and modernization of our country, we have undertaken broad reforms that require, inter alia, the recruitment of new officials. thus, thousands of young people have found work in the public and private sectors thanks to the creation of better production conditions for the economic and social development of the country. with regard to the economic sector, appropriate measures have been taken to put public finances on a sound footing, create a favourable framework for business and attract investment, particularly from abroad. in this context, i take this opportunity to once again make an urgent appeal to all our bilateral and multilateral partners, particularly the european union and the bretton woods institutions, to help togo in its efforts towards socio-economic recovery. in the opinion of my delegation, the development and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction represent a growing threat to international peace and security, and thus a reason for us to give these questions the highest priority. in this regard, my country welcomed the security council summit held on 24 september, under the presidency of the united states, on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. while we reaffirm that multilateralism is the fundamental principle governing our consideration of disarmament and non-proliferation, togo hopes that the security council summit will lead to a new approach to this crucial question. with regard to light arms, togo reiterates its desire to see the current session of the assembly commit to strengthening the implementation of the project aimed at negotiating a treaty on the traffic in light arms, as has been done by the economic community of west african states in this area. concerning terrorism, an obstacle to peace and lasting development, my country feels that it has become imperative to improve and globalize the international legal framework in order to combat this scourge, which has assumed a new form in modern times. in this regard, the completion within a reasonable time frame of negotiations on a draft comprehensive convention against international terrorism would be salutary and in the interests of all. similarly, the phenomenon of drugs, and in particular the illicit traffic in drugs along the west coast of africa, has become a true danger and a destabilizing factor for the region. in light of the scale of this scourge, it is beyond a shadow of a doubt that no country can combat or hope to put an end to it alone. togo therefore appeals for international cooperation, and in particular for assistance from the wealthy countries and competent organizations, in eradicating this phenomenon and thereby restoring the climate of security so essential to development. for its part, in spite of its scarce resources, togo has undertaken a relentless struggle against drug traffickers and is cooperating with its neighbours in order to contain the scourge. as we all know, international peace and security continue to be threatened and the stability of certain countries disturbed by conflicts, terrorism and underdevelopment, all of which are largely man-made. indeed, in the democratic republic of the congo, chad, the central african republic and darfur, where crises continue, our organization should continue to engage in a search for solutions that will allow those countries to recover the peace and security necessary to their development. in somalia, despite the initiatives undertaken in april 2009 by the international community and by the african union in july 37 09-53165 2009 in support of security institutions and the african union mission in somalia, the situation remains precarious and disturbing. that is why my country urgently appeals for other urgent measures to be taken to prevent that country from succumbing to chaos for good. regarding cote divoire, we note with satisfaction the positive evolution of the political situation in that country since the ouagadougou political agreement. consequently, we call on the stakeholders to display the political will to organize the presidential election. with regard to guinea, it would seem appropriate and timely to encourage the political class to find, through dialogue and consultation, ways and means of ensuring a rapid return to constitutional order. as to the situation in the niger, where the revision of the constitution has provoked a crisis, my country hopes that the parties concerned in the niger will strive to restore dialogue and consensus in order to maintain a climate of peace and harmony in that sister country. outside the african continent, in the middle east, a theatre of violence and desolation, an equitable and final settlement of the conflicts between the countries of this region should be found as soon as possible. to that end, the international community should encourage the various actors to find a peaceful solution to their conflicts. in this regard, my delegation reaffirms that the solution of the israeli-palestinian conflict requires the creation of a palestinian state living side by side with the state of israel within secure and internationally recognized borders. furthermore, my country deplores the continuing acts of terrorism that have afflicted the peoples of afghanistan, iraq and pakistan and undermined the efforts of these countries to promote development. that is why we urge the international community to increase its assistance to the governments of those countries in their fight against terrorism in order to promote peace and reconstruction. after two decades of economic stagnation resulting from policies of budgetary austerity imposed on developing countries, the latter are now facing new challenges from the food, financial, energy and environmental crises. in the light of this situation, it is imperative to work to mitigate the financial shock and to pursue bold policies to increase the agricultural and energy production capacities of the developing countries. at the same time, we need to consider overall structural reform of the world economic and financial system in order to prevent a resurgence of such crises. my country therefore welcomed the high- level conference on the world financial and economic crisis and its impact on development, held from 24 to 26 june, which illustrated the need for international solidarity in the face of the crisis in order to ease the suffering of the peoples of developing countries. in that context, togo welcomes the early implementation, in april 2009, of one of the pledges made at the g-20 meeting in london, concerning the establishment of the global trade liquidity programme amounting to $50 billion from 2009 to 2011, $15 billion of which are allocated to the african continent. similarly, my country welcomes the initiative taken in march 2009 by the african development bank to create a special $500 million funding mechanism for african trade. furthermore, my delegation is pleased that the united nations, at the initiative of the secretary-general, has taken the measure of the danger posed to humanity by the problem of climate change and the degradation of the environment. in this regard, the high-level meeting that took place a few days ago in this very body was an opportunity to analyse the situation and to clear the way for the climate change conference in copenhagen in december. to paraphrase a great man, we have inherited the earth and we should not destroy it. living creatures come and go, but the earth remains. in the face of the questions that my delegation has just raised, it is imperative to intensify partnerships of all kinds if we wish to prevent a situation in which, 64 years after its creation, our shared organization should find itself still facing the same challenges. it is to be hoped, therefore, that member states, in whose 09-53165 38 interest it is that the united nations should be more democratic, strong and effective, should determine to give it the resources necessary to permit it to achieve the millennium development goals and thereby to meet the challenges that our world faces today.",Togo,Africa,57.0933799743652,2.768079996109009,2341.0,16.0,0.0,16.0,6.834686031610423
UGA,65,2010,"i did not attend the high- level meeting on the millennium development goals (mdgs), as i was not yet in new york. nevertheless, i would like to inform the general assembly that uganda will definitely achieve the following mdgs: goal 1, on the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger; goal 2, on achieving universal primary education; goal 3, on the empowerment of women and the promotion of gender equality; goal 7, on ensuring environmental sustainability; and goal 8, on creating a global partnership for development. it is only in the areas of maternal and child health that we may not achieve by 2015 the targets set. however, in uganda, we have developed a national road map to accelerate the reduction of maternal and child mortality and morbidity, which is a comprehensive strategy that clearly spells out our national priorities in this area. in this strategy, we have given priority to four key intervention types, namely effective antenatal care, skilled attendance at birth, emergency care for women who experience complications in childbirth and family planning. we have also given priority to creating infrastructure that supports and strengthens the health-care system. regarding mdg 6, uganda has made tremendous efforts with respect to hiv/aids prevention and control. we are now renewing our efforts to deal with the challenges of the hiv/aids epidemic. it is noteworthy that, overall, uganda was recently ranked among the middle performing countries according to the united nations development programmes human development index. however, in uganda, we have never believed in donor-anchored responses to the mdgs as a sustainable solution. responses to the mdgs should be anchored in the growth and transformation of the economies of the target countries. i am therefore glad that the cloud of afro-pessimism is dispersing. the opinions of the afro-pessimists are being consigned to 10-54965 30 where they have always belonged to the dung-heap of history. some groups in the west, where afro-pessimism abounded in the past, have now started talking of the african lions, no doubt equating in their minds the performance of the african economies with the asian tigers of yesteryear. groups like the mckinsey global institute are beginning to group the african economies which collectively recorded a growth rate of 4.9 per cent of gross domestic product in the gloomy years of the recent global depression, compared with the mere 2 per cent of gross domestic product that the countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development recorded in the same period into four categories. those categories are: diversified economies, oil-exporting economies, economies in transition and pre-transition economies. uganda was put in the group of transition economies. although the mckinsey group needs to improve their statistical base and some of their insights, they are among the first western groups to recognize what we who have been working on african issues for a long time, on goals we set out to achieve in the years after independence long knew was possible: to make africa move from third world to first world, in the words of lee kuan yew, the former prime minister of singapore. although there are 53 economies of africa being managed by the respective national authorities, reform trends and ideas are sometimes shared. the mckinsey group estimates that the consumption level of africa, which stood at $860 billion in 2008, will grow to $1.4 trillion by 2020. what one needs to add is the fact that those economies have become roaring lions, underdeveloped infrastructure notwithstanding. what will happen when the infrastructure bottlenecks are resolved? that is the question that one should ask oneself. what will happen when there is cheap and abundant electricity, cheap road transport and cheap rail transport? those areas had been neglected for a long time. the study by the mckinsey global institute revealed that there are now 316 million new mobile phone subscribers since the year 2000 in africa, more than the entire population of the united states. in other words, there are now more mobile phones in africa than there are american people living in the united states. there are 600 million hectares of uncultivated arable land in africa. if our partners could concentrate on assisting infrastructure development, africas transition would be that much faster. all the same, a country like uganda is transitioning. aid in relevant sectors is welcome, but even without aid we are moving forward. i know the theme of the general debate is reaffirming the central role of the united nations in global governance. in my short address i have not talked directly about this. i have instead spoken about africas economic reawakening as a roaring lion. was i irrelevant? i do not think so. it is those strong building blocks that will strengthen the united nations. africa has been a weak link in the chain of the struggle for improved governance in the world over the last 50 years. improved economic performance in africa is, therefore, good for the continent and also good for the rest of the world.",Uganda,Africa,73.2118835449219,1.727399945259094,829.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.4125452352231602
CMR,65,2010,"i would like first to extend my hearty congratulations to you, sir, on your unanimous election as president of the general assembly at its sixty-fifth session. with your rich experience in international affairs, we believe you will succeed in your task. i would also like to pay tribute to your predecessor, mr. ali abdussalem treki, for his commitment and skill in discharging his challenging functions during the previous session, and i convey to him my special thanks. i also wish to thank secretary-general ban ki-moon and his aides for their untiring efforts in the service of peace and development throughout the world, particularly in the least developed countries. as the first decade of the twenty-first century draws to a close, it is certainly worthwhile to review the ground covered since we proclaimed, some 10 years ago in this very hall, our common resolve to cut poverty in half by 2015, worldwide. we all recall the enthusiasm engendered by that solemn commitment. today, we are forced to note that we are still quite far off the track. more than one billion people are still living in extreme poverty. the development gap between the countries of the north and those of the south continues to widen instead of narrowing. international assistance is stagnating and remains below the level of commitment made by developed countries to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to it. the results in the eight priority areas of the millennium development goals are disappointing, even unsatisfactory, while the deadline of 2015 is just around the corner. so what happened? the economic crisis caused by the recent upheavals in financial markets is certainly to blame. the slowdown in activity worldwide and, in some cases, recession monopolized the attention of the countries of the north. they gave priority to reviving their own economies and solving their own social problems. however, even though we can understand that, it does not explain everything. in fact, the awareness shown at the turn of the century of the disastrous consequences of deepening poverty in the third world seems to have waned significantly. yet the situation has not only failed to improve, it continues to deteriorate. on several occasions, from this rostrum and elsewhere, i have drawn the attention of the international community to the problem posed by the growth in poverty worldwide. i have pointed out that, for ethical reasons, it behooves us all to express solidarity with the most underprivileged. i have further indicated that this is, of course, in everyones interests, for the ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor can only exacerbate tensions and jeopardize international peace and security. i will be pardoned, i am sure, if i dwell a little on the case of africa. it is undeniably the continent most affected by extreme poverty, which is generally accompanied by food shortages, epidemics, population movements and insecurity. is it any wonder, then, that such profound misery sometimes explodes, as was the case two years ago during what were dubbed the food riots? the international community cannot remain indifferent to such a threat, which could undermine our efforts to advance democracy and ensure our development. let me make myself clear. it is not a matter of engaging in recriminations for the sake of any ideology, of ascribing motives to this or that country or group of countries, or of sermonizing. i am the first to acknowledge that the united nations and its agencies have provided assistance and guidance to our continent since independence; that most countries of the north have, through their cooperation, financial assistance and debt cancellation, lent and continue to lend irreplaceable support to africa; and that emerging countries have taken over. we are, of course, grateful to all of them. 10-54833 24 however, that obviously is not enough. i am not trying to apportion blame for this state of affairs. i merely want to say that the solutions applied were perhaps not the best. i would add that from the african perspective, we have been burdened with too many historical handicaps slavery, colonization, economic dependence and internal and external conflicts and, of course, that we have lacked toughness and steadiness of mind. for reasons of mutual interest mentioned earlier, i think we should review the issue thoroughly, without ulterior ideological motives or political or economic prejudices. no matter what is said, africa has changed significantly over the past 50 years and seems to me to be ready for a wide-ranging ideological debate on the issue, provided that it is conducted in a true spirit of partnership. through this approach we can realize the famous marshall plan for africa, which is often mentioned but has yet to see the light of day. that concern led cameroon to organize an international conference africa 21 in yaounde on the occasion of the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of its achieving sovereignty. at that conference the 50 years of african independence were objectively assessed and the future opportunities for our continent were evaluated. the conference was attended by several heads of state and government, former prime ministers, high-level representatives of international organizations, experts of world renown, major corporate executives and nobel peace prize winners. the final declaration of the conference, which my delegation has made available, can serve as a kind of guide for the rehabilitation of africa, with regard to both its economic recovery and its participation in international life. that is what it is all about ensuring that our continent does not remain forever aid-dependent and that it plays its rightful role in international affairs. allow me, in this hall, to emphasize the second point. how can we today explain why africa is the only continent without a permanent member on the security council? how can we explain that africa is unable to make its voice heard when its problems are examined in global economic and financial bodies while the decisions made there will be imposed on it? at a time when emerging countries are rightly calling for a seat on the security council commensurate with their economic and political weight, africa as a whole should not be forgotten. for a long time our continent has been treated, i dare say, as an object of international relations. yet, it is directly affected by most of the major problems confronting humanity today, be they migratory flows, global warming, economic and financial regulation, terrorism, et cetera. in short, it is sometimes the victim of phenomena for which it is not responsible. from that standpoint also, there is a need to get out of the rut in which major negotiations appear to be bogged down. africans seek more understanding and sympathy in the true sense of the words. the delayed development from which they suffer cannot be reduced to the millennium goals. admittedly, they want to be less poor and to eat their fill, but above all, to be protected from fear and want, to be freer and to imagine a future without anxiety. in short, they want to live in a society that guarantees them those minimum conditions for existence and well-being. most african countries have embarked on this path. for its part, over the last decades cameroon has set up representative institutions, established the rule of law and ensured respect for human rights. on the economic and social front, significant progress has been made in the areas of public finance, education and health. should this trend continue, our country can expect, in the medium term, to attain the status of an emerging country. that to me seems to be the mindset of most african countries. certainly, the international community has a role to play in supporting them in their effort to join the global society. to that end, the international community needs to show more understanding, solidarity and, of course, more fraternity.",Cameroon,Africa,71.2905120849609,2.848030090332031,1304.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.5337423312883436
MWI,65,2010,"i am delighted to address the sixty-fifth session of the general assembly as chairman of the african union. i offer my personal congratulations and those of the african union to you, sir, on your election as president of the united nations general assembly at its sixty-fifth session. i assure you, sir, of africas support in your work. i pay tribute to his excellency mr. ali abdussalam treki, president of the general assembly at its sixty-fourth session for his leadership during his tenure of office. i also commend our secretary-general, his excellency mr. ban ki-moon, for his exemplary leadership of our organization and the excellent manner in which he continues to discharge his responsibilities. africa is particularly grateful for his continued support of africas development agenda. i am happy to say that africa welcomes the theme for the sixty-fifth session of the general assembly that reaffirms the role of the united nations in global governance. african leaders believe that the united nations, with its universal membership, is well placed to build political consensus for global governance. they hold the view that the united nations has the potential to bring about solutions to common governance problems that our global village continues to encounter, such as managing diversity and combating terrorism and conflict. i believe that now, more than ever before, the united nations needs to strengthen its institutions to enable it to promote peace and stability and facilitate balanced growth and prosperity between developed and developing countries. africa also wishes to remind the united nations not to lose sight of its commitment to fight poverty. poverty reduction must remain the central focus of the united nations. 10-54827 16 as we reflect on this years theme, the central role of the united nations in global governance, i am fully aware that the africa the world hears about is that of incessant calamities and natural disasters. international media report on the africa of extreme poverty, widespread endemic diseases and human suffering. they constantly portray the africa of civil wars, genocide, terrorism and piracy. they glorify the africa of underdevelopment and hopelessness. but in their reports we do not hear about the success stories of a number of african governments. we do not hear about the successes in participatory democracy and good governance. we do not hear about the peaceful multiparty general elections. we do not hear about the high rates of macroeconomic growth in some african countries. we do not hear about the successes in food security in some of them. that is why i now want to present another africa to the general assembly. it is the africa of new hopes and new possibilities, the africa of industrial, mineral, and agro-processing opportunities, the africa with new job creation prospects, and the africa that can produce enough food for all. yes, this is the africa i want the assembly to know. this is the africa of the new beginning. i want the world to know that we african leaders have a clear vision of a new africa free of hunger, disease and poverty. we have the vision of a new africa that is prosperous and full of hope. we have the vision of african nations determined to contribute more to global economic prosperity, peace and stability. i want to inform the world that the leaders of the african union have decided to unlock africas combined huge natural resources and human capital to establish new industries to create new wealth for our people. that is why this year i have chosen to address the assembly on the subject of africa of the new beginning. i want the united nations to share our belief that africa is not a poor continent; rather, it is its people that are poor. this year, i have come to inform this world body that africa has decided to shift from afro-pessimism to afro-optimism. we are going to make africa better. now, turning to global issues, i want to say that the world today faces the challenge of producing enough food to feed the over nine billion people living on this earth, and it must do this against the backdrop of rising food prices, global warming, climate change and environmental degradation. i am pleased to inform this world body that african leaders fully recognize these problems and have unanimously agreed to institute new measures to ensure that five years from now, africa will be able to produce enough food to feed its people. they have also decided that, five years from now, no child in africa will die of hunger or malnutrition. in order to meet these targets, the african union decided to turn the continent into an african food basket whose main aim is to encourage allocation of increased budgetary resources and private sector investment to agriculture and food production. for that to happen, african leaders have agreed to redesign their policy efforts to focus on three priority areas, namely, agriculture and food security, transport and energy development, and climate change. it is envisaged that effective transport structures and adequate energy supply will enhance agricultural production and food processing as well as improve human mobility and the marketing of food and agricultural products from surplus countries to deficit countries across the african continent. the african food basket concept envisages full cooperation between africa and governments of the group of eight. the united nations, the food and agriculture organization, the world bank, the european union and other multilateral institutions will also cooperate in this effort. i now want to briefly raise some issues of major concern to africa: the adverse effects of climate change, fragile peace and security, terrorism and piracy, maternal, infant and child mortality, and slow reform of the united nations. african leaders recognize that climate change and environmental degradation are among the most serious global challenges that affect africa negatively. all countries in the world share the adverse effects of climate change. all countries in the world are, to varying degrees, experiencing the adverse impacts of climate change such as severe cyclones, hurricanes, rising sea levels and water salinization, prolonged severe droughts and overall global warming. there is enough evidence to show that most countries in africa, asia and latin america are the least able and equipped to cope with those challenges. 17 10-54827 the global nature of climate change therefore calls for an effective, immediate and appropriate international response. we need to act, and act now. the international community has acknowledged that climate change is a real threat to humanity, and yet the performance of the major players at the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen disappointed africa and developing nations elsewhere by their intransigency. the leaders of africa therefore would like to see the united nations framework convention on climate change and the kyoto protocol be urgently implemented as essential interventions to address climate change. those conventions spell out in detail what is to be done to mitigate climate change. on behalf of africa, i call for immediate implementation of those decisions in order to avert impending human catastrophe. i am glad to note that maternal, infant and child health and welfare are among the underlying issues of the theme of the general assembly this year. that calls for concerted action for the achievement of the millennium development goals. i am pleased to say that the african union has reaffirmed its commitments to the reduction of maternal, infant and child mortality in africa. african governments have undertaken to launch the four-year campaign for accelerated reduction of maternal mortality in africa. we also agreed to call on the global fund to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria to create a new window to fund maternal, newborn and child health. let me, therefore, take advantage of the general assembly to appeal on behalf of africa to our development partners and donors to replenish the global fund during next months meeting and to increase resources for maternal, newborn and child health. another global governance issue of major concern to africa is the lack of movement on international trade under the doha round multilateral trade negotiations. members of the united nations agree that trade is a conduit to development in every country. therefore we in africa appeal for an urgent conclusion of the doha round, for we believe that that is essential to revive global trade and to aid in global economic recovery. any outcome of the doha round negotiations must lead to clear benefits for farmers, producers, exporters and consumers in developing countries, including in africa. nations of the world must redouble efforts to resolve all impediments to the successful outcome of the trade negotiations. the advancement of women and gender equality continues to be the cornerstone of the africa of the new beginning. women have played and continue to play a decisive role in the global, continental and national agendas for democracy, transition and development. i am happy to inform the general assembly that african governments have intensified the fight against gender- based violence, sexual abuse, discrimination and trafficking in women and girls. the ultimate objective is to have more coherent and meaningful interventions that will adequately increase the number of women in high decision-making positions in the advancement of growth and development. on peace and security, i wish to underscore that the african union considers that democracy, good governance and development cannot be sustainable without peace and security. african countries have made significant progress in ensuring that peace and security prevail on the african continent. several countries have conducted peaceful elections, and there is growing tolerance and accommodation between the ruling and opposition parties in many countries. that is encouraging. however, africa has of late witnessed the re- emergence of coups detat and other unconstitutional changes of government. the african union has taken a strong collective decision that those negative trends will not be allowed to continue. the african union is also gravely concerned that somalia has had no stable or functioning government for a long time. that continuing volatile situation is being compounded by increasing organized piracy in the indian ocean. that negatively affects not only somalia and her immediate neighbours, but the entire african continent and the rest of the world. i believe the situation calls for a new approach and new intervention. more countries should be directly involved in seeking a lasting solution to the somalia crisis. the situation in the sudan presents a special challenge to the african union and to the united nations. although some progress has been achieved towards the implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement, the african union eagerly awaits the holding of the referendum in january 2011 and the post-referendum structure of relations in the sudan. 10-54827 18 one of the most immediate options in the sudan is to consolidate the prevailing peace and stability there. the african countries are concerned that while efforts to secure lasting peace in the sudan are ongoing, the international criminal court seems to push for a pound of flesh by insisting on arresting president omer hassan al-bashir. there is general consensus in africa that that would have a negative effect, polarizing the different positions of the stakeholders and thereby driving them away from a peaceful settlement. the african union therefore strongly appeals to the general assembly to amend article 16 of the rome statute to enable it to assume the powers of the security council to defer the case against president al-bashir for one year to allow ongoing negotiations and dialogue to succeed. on behalf of the african union, i wish to express appreciation for the contribution of the united nations to the promotion of peace, security and stability in african countries. the united nations has performed very well in many parts of africa, including the democratic republic of the congo, the sudan, chad and west african countries. those efforts in the search for solutions to the ongoing conflicts on the continent are highly commendable. the sanctions against some members of the african union and the non-aligned movement have caused great economic hardship, especially to the poor and more vulnerable people in those countries. the african union feels that the ideological justifications, if there ever were any, have outlived their time. sanctions are also inconsistent with the emerging dialogue for the reform of the united nations. sanctions are also inconsistent with the obligations of united nations member states to promote social progress and better standards of life, as promulgated in the preamble to the charter of the united nations. the african union therefore appeals for the immediate lifting of sanctions against the republic of zimbabwe and the republic of cuba. we believe that would enable ordinary poor zimbabweans and cubans to begin a life of new hope and new prospects. as to the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, the african union supports the position taken by the non-aligned movement calling for justice and equal treatment for all nations concerned. with regard to the reforms of the united nations and the security council, the african union believes that for the organization to be effective in fulfilling its mandate as an honest broker, the proposed reforms must be implemented in the spirit of equity and fairness. in this regard i would like to reiterate the african unions request for two permanent seats with full veto powers and five non-permanent seats. the african union should also have the right to determine the selection of africas representatives on the council. once implemented, that would enable africa to effectively participate in the global governance that the united nations is now propagating. in conclusion, i wish to reaffirm africas strong belief that a reformed united nations and specialized agencies are likely to play a more effective role in global governance and in a more equitable global trading and financial system. i believe that the united nations in its new governance role should support the africa of the new beginning. a strong africa industrially, economically and politically is a better trading partner for the g8 countries and the rest of the world than a weaker one. i also believe that the africa of the new beginning with its combined vast mineral, agricultural and human resources will provide the safety valve for a boiling international monetary and financial system. think about these things.",Malawi,Africa,61.3097190856934,2.432369947433472,2374.0,19.0,0.0,19.0,8.003369839932603
ZAF,65,2010,"my delegation joins previous speakers in expressing our congratulations to mr. joseph deiss on his election as president of the general assembly at its sixty-fifth session. we want to take this opportunity to assure him of our full cooperation and to wish him a very successful and rewarding term. i also take this opportunity to thank mr. ali treki for the excellent work he did in steering this assembly during his tenure as president during its sixty-fourth session. the theme of the sixty-fifth session of the general assembly reaffirming the central role of the united nations in global governance resonates with what our global citizen, nelson rolihlahla mandela, said about this body on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary: the united nations has to reassess its role, redefine its profile and reshape its structures. it should truly reflect the diversity of our universe and ensure equity among the nations in the 10-55109 26 exercise of power within the system of international relations, in general, and the security council, in particular. (a/50/pv.37, p. 6) my delegation supports the choice of this theme, and we wish to reiterate our belief in the centrality of the united nations and the system of multilateralism. despite the challenges that face humanity in the twenty-first century, the relevance of the united nations as a multilateral mechanism through which a myriad of complex world affairs can be administered and resolved cannot be overemphasized. those challenges compel us more than ever before to strengthen the united nations. south africa is committed to working with other member states to achieve the full potential of the united nations to address the urgent challenges facing the international community by making it more relevant, more responsive to the diversity of humankind and more representative. the creation of the united nations was one of the notable successes of the twentieth century, and thanks to its existence the world has been spared another war on the scale and magnitude of the first and second world wars. the exponential growth in the membership of the organization over the years, from 51 members in 1945 to 192 today, clearly demonstrates the confidence that the peoples of the world have placed in the united nations and the ideals contained in its charter. the universal membership of the united nations gives it the legitimacy to be at the centre of efforts to address global challenges. however, the question is whether the united nations has leveraged that diversity of its membership as a source of strength and acted decisively against any tendency that runs contrary to its fundamental values and founding principles. the answer to this is yes because, in the past, the united nations played an invaluable role in the worldwide process of decolonization, transforming the political landscape of the world and bringing much- cherished freedom and independence to the peoples of africa, asia and latin america. the organization was instrumental in bringing about the demise of the universally despised apartheid system in our own country, south africa. when the organization recognized the right to development as a human right, it gave voice and hope to those who know the face of poverty. when the organization has sent its troops to far-flung places to keep peace among neighbours who should be living together, it has again underscored the reason for which it was established. amid all the challenges, the united nations has been relevant and responsive to our diverse interests. five years ago, at the world summit, we agreed that, if the organization were to continue to play its central role in global governance effectively, there was a need to strengthen and reposition it to deal with the challenges of the twenty-first century. we believe that the revitalization of the general assembly remains one of the cornerstones of the united nations reform agenda. the general assembly is the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the united nations and plays a critical role in the process of standard-setting and the codification of international law. its decisions are taken by a collective among equals for the common good. we will support measures that are aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the general assembly, especially regarding its role in the maintenance of international peace and security. indeed, we witnessed with satisfaction how, on several occasions, the general assembly acted promptly when the security council was unwilling or unable to respond to grave developments in the aftermath of the conflict in gaza in 2009. indeed, no transformation of the united nations could be complete without the fundamental reform of the security council. south africa believes that the objective of the reform should be to create a security council that is truly representative of the membership and effectively responsive to international crises, as mandated by the charter of the united nations. indeed, it remains a travesty of justice that africa, which accounts for a large portion of the work of the council, is not represented in the permanent category. thus, deliberations about us carry on without us. the world should be free of weapons of mass destruction, in accordance with our undertakings on total disarmament. in that regard, south africa welcomes the recently agreed programme of work of the conference on disarmament. 27 10-55109 while the right to development and freedom from want are central to the work of the united nations, we have just ended the high-level plenary meeting to review our performance in achieving the millennium development goals and agreed that more needs to be done to act on commitments already made by the international community in that regard. the people of haiti have a story to tell about how best the international community can respond in unison and effectively to a nation in distress. a speedy and satisfactory conclusion of the doha round of the world trade organization, which promised so much for the developing south, unfortunately remains a dream yet to be fulfilled. at the same time, the global economic crisis has highlighted the point that many of us have always made about the need to work for an international financial architecture that is sensitive to the development needs of the south. the contribution of the group of 20 (g-20) is a welcome development in that regard, and we believe that the group should complement and reinforce the good work of the united nations and not act as an alternative. in its composition, the g-20 will also need to mirror the rich diversity of humankind by making sure that all regions of the world, in particular africa, are well represented. we look forward to the full implementation of the undertakings made to transform the international financial architecture, including the reform of the bretton woods institutions, as a step towards building a world system founded on equity and social justice. environmental issues, including climate change, have also become high on the priorities of the international agenda. south africa is fully committed to a multilateral outcome on the basis of the bali plan of action, with a two-track negotiated and legally binding outcome. we are convinced that the copenhagen accord provides political guidance for future negotiations. accordingly, we should work together to ensure that the forthcoming meeting of the sixteenth session of the conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change in mexico takes bold and concrete steps to address climate change and its effects. for our part, south africa will have the opportunity to host the seventeenth session of the conference of the parties in december 2011, on the eve of the end of the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol. peace and stability are one of the preconditions for bringing about an africa of the new beginning that the chairperson of the african union, his excellency president wa mutharika of malawi, spoke of on the first day of the general debate (see ). the united nations has been an important partner to africa, working with us through the african union, whether in somalia, the sudan or the democratic republic of congo. south africa is encouraged by the commitment shown by the international community in trying to assist the both the government of the sudan and southern sudan as they prepare for the upcoming referendum in january 2011. the people of zimbabwe also need the helping hand of the international community in implementing their global political agreement. the african union and the southern african development community speak for us, too, in calling for the lifting of sanctions against zimbabwe. we will continue to work with the peoples of zimbabwe, madagascar and burundi, among others, in their efforts to build and consolidate peace and democracy in their respective countries. in the case of western sahara, south africa remains concerned about the continuing impasse, which stands in the way of a solution that will result in the people of western sahara exercising their inalienable right to self-determination. we count on the united nations, especially the security council, to continue to make decisions that enable us to decisively deal with the challenges of peace and security on our continent. the united nations should see africa as a partner in the maintenance of international peace and the management of conflicts, and accordingly do more to strengthen the working relationship between the security council and the african union peace and security council. in this respect, south africa will continue to support all international efforts to help the people of palestine and israel in their endeavour to find lasting peace, leading to the establishment of a viable palestinian state, on the basis of the 1967 borders and with east jerusalem as its capital, existing side by side in peace and security with israel. we are at one with the call made by several delegations for the lifting of the embargo on the republic of cuba. 10-55109 28 we have converged here year after year to make strong statements on palestine, the embargo on cuba and the independence of the western sahara. the ultimate test of the relevance of the united nations will therefore be in bringing closure to all these long outstanding issues in a manner that is consistent with our decisions and the collective will of nations represented in this organization. in conclusion, we were also privileged recently to be the stage, and africa the theatre, of the 2010 federation internationale de football association world cup tournament. our people spoke for us during that soccer event in how they embraced each other and in their diversity of many nations, consistent with the spirit of ubuntu, which simply means i am because you are. they gave us hope and confirmed the faith we have in our belief that a better world is possible. the role of sport in development and in advancing peace can never be underestimated. as states, we can best respond to this message from our people by making sure that the united nations, in playing its role in the global system, is more relevant, more inclusive and more representative. looking ahead, south africa is honoured to have been endorsed by the african union as a candidate for the security council non-permanent membership for the period 2011-2012. we stand ready to continue to contribute to the achievement of peace and security in the world.",South Africa,Africa,92.8773193359375,5.134970188140869,1877.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.5327650506126798
GHA,65,2010,"let me begin by congratulating the president of the assembly on his election to lead the assembly at its sixty-fifth session. i trust that he will, with his outstanding experience and excellent diplomatic skills, steer this assembly to a successful conclusion. i also wish to thank his predecessor, his excellency mr. ali abdussalam treki, for the efficient and able manner with which he presided over the assembly at its sixty-fourth session. ghana subscribes to the declaration by the african union assembly of heads of state and government that designated 2010 as a year of peace and security. ghana will, therefore, continue to engage other member states in the search for peace and security in places on the african continent that have known no peace, and we will contribute to renewed global efforts to prevent conflicts through preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. as we witness a decline in the number of the violent conflicts that afflicted many countries over the past decade or more, it is time to renew our commitment to the work of the peacebuilding commission in order to ensure that countries emerging from conflict do not relapse into violence. ghana was privileged to have served on the organizational committee of the peacebuilding commission (pbc) and will remain actively involved in the pursuit of the attainment of the strategic objectives set for the post- conflict countries on the agenda of the commissions country-specific configuration. in this regard, ghana supports the steps being taken to also place liberia on the agenda of the commission. as agreed by world leaders in 2005, ghana strongly supports the principle of the responsibility to protect as the normative framework to prevent and deter the occurrence of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing, which have occurred in many countries that were emerging from conflict. while the fear of its abuse does not take away the intrinsic value of the principle of the responsibility to protect, caution must be exercised in order to avoid its abuse. the principle is not intended to undermine the sovereignty of states; on the contrary, it is to ensure that sovereign responsibility is exercised in a manner that will prevent a repetition of the mass atrocities that were experienced in places like rwanda, srebrenica, cambodia and sierra leone, with devastating impacts on neighbouring countries. sadly, in many places, some of those conflicts persist in varying degrees of intensity. the international community must be ready and willing to assist national authorities who request such assistance with a view to developing or enhancing the capacity of countries that are manifestly unable or unwilling to uphold this responsibility to do so. to that end, we welcome the secretary-generals proposal to establish a joint office to coordinate united nations system-wide efforts to strengthen early warning mechanisms aimed at ensuring timely and decisive preventive action and/or intervention in appropriate cases, in accordance with the united nations charter. 10-55264 22 while the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger is a major development challenge for africa, most countries in the region are also grappling with the problems of climate change, a high disease burden, poor infrastructure, brain drain and the lack of development of productive capacity. in the last few years, african countries have had to deal with the effects of rising food and energy prices and the complications arising from the global financial and economic crisis. those multiple crises have not only reversed impressive recent progress in economic performance, but are also jeopardizing efforts by african countries to achieve the millennium development goals (mdgs). it is gratifying to see that the interests of the international community in climate change have increased markedly in recent times, especially after the adoption of the bali action plan in 2007. we need to sustain that interest and build on the common ground that was first found in rio de janeiro in 1992, with the establishment of the united nations framework convention on climate change, and was subsequently built on in berlin, kyoto, marrakech, bali, copenhagen and, soon, cancun. there are issues that need to be addressed for progress in cancun and beyond. what is missing is a demonstrable political will. without that, countries will not see the need to raise their ambitions to cut emissions. industrialized countries have made pledges to cut emissions by 2020. however commendable those commitments may be, they fall short of the 25 to 40 per cent cut that the intergovernmental panel on climate change says will give the world a chance of staying below the recommended two-degree average global temperature rise. we need to preserve the kyoto protocol, which is currently the only existing international agreement with legal status to verify emission reductions. that is why it is critical for all parties to work together to address the divisions over a second commitment period for the kyoto protocol and ensure its continuity after 2012. just as there was aid fatigue, developing countries may soon be experiencing promise fatigue. we must get the numerous pledges out of the fine print and make them work for humanity. i am simply appealing to industrialized nations to fulfil their funding pledges, including the $30 billion in fast-track financing for developing country adaptation and mitigation efforts through 2012, and the pledge to raise $100 billion a year by 2020. for developing countries, the early delivery and transparent allocation of that money will boost our confidence in the dialogue and show that industrialized countries are truly committed to progress in the broader negotiations. we have made progress in the implementation of the mdg agenda. however, keeping the solemn promise we made in 2000 and achieving the goals by 2015 will require intensified efforts, much more resources and effective cooperation. no one should be oblivious to the enormous challenges african and other developing countries face in their efforts to achieve the mdgs. ghana will not compromise under any guise in its pursuit of good governance and the promotion of the rule of law, as these are important prerequisites for achieving sustainable social and economic development. african countries themselves have come to acknowledge that part of the reason for their impoverishment could be ascribed to poor post- independence governance practices. that is why most african countries have taken steps to consolidate their governance institutions, including strengthening the electoral system. food security is a national priority for ghana. for most ghanaians, getting enough good-quality food at affordable prices is a major concern. the government is therefore implementing a progressive agricultural policy that will ensure increased production, especially in staples and other food crops that our climate and land can efficiently support. ghana will soon become an important producer of oil and gas. the focus of the government is to ensure that ghanaians will derive the maximum benefit from oil production. although oil revenues will start to flow around the fourth quarter of the year, the government is taking measures to ensure accountability and transparency in the management of revenue from oil production. to that end, an oil and gas revenue management bill has been submitted to parliament for approval. in addition, the government is holding a series of consultations with several countries and private operators who have expertise and experience in the field so that their knowledge can be tapped and best practices adopted. 23 10-55264 in our efforts to create wealth and prosperity for our citizens, ghana has made attracting foreign investment an important pillar in its development strategies. we will continue to pursue such policies in the belief that our efforts will be supported and rewarded with genuine partnership. africa is tired of the misery and poverty arising from resource-induced violent conflicts. africa wants to use its oil and natural resources to create wealth for its citizens. we call on the united nations and well-meaning development partners, including the international business community, to support our efforts to nip the so-called resource curse in the bud and exploit our god-given natural endowments for development. whereas the international environment for growth in africa is still favourable, the risks posed by global imbalances and external shocks, such as the recent financial crisis, call for increased international policy coordination. we need a renewed spirit of solidarity and commitment for a comprehensive global response if we are to confront the challenges of our time. it is in that light that ghana wishes to reaffirm its commitment to the ideals of the united nations and continue to live up to its charter obligations, including playing an active role in international peacekeeping, in order to assist the organization in its task of maintaining global peace and security and promoting fruitful and beneficial cooperation among member states. we must resolve to muster the political will to strengthen the united nations so that it can function effectively and redeem the majority of our peoples from wars, diseases and poverty by providing the financial and material resources required to discharge those onerous responsibilities. it is only when we measure up to those responsibilities that we can give meaning to the phrase we the peoples of the united nations.",Ghana,Africa,71.4970703125,5.540599822998047,1508.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.6631299734748011
RWA,65,2010,"at this sixty-fifth session of the general assembly, it is right that we re-examine the role of the united nations in global governance, as we strive to help it adapt as fast as our times are changing, so that it serves all its members equally. in my understanding, global governance recognizes the inevitable and welcome interconnectedness of nations, the unique circumstances and contributions of each and the principle of mutual respect. i say welcome because, as we have seen, major threats of a global scale like the financial crisis, climate change, terrorism, poverty and other challenges to world peace need the concerted efforts of all nations if they are to be addressed effectively. the just-concluded high-level plenary meeting on the millennium development goals has provided us another opportunity to assess the role of the united nations, measure the progress we have made and consider the hurdles that remain in meeting the various goals we set for ourselves. it is evident that the united nations is uniquely placed to play a crucial role in mobilizing and galvanizing all nations for the common good, driving forward our collective initiatives and coordinating actions that foster the social and economic development of all. still, the united nations is the sum total of member states, and it can only be as good as the constituent members want it to be. if there were a common understanding and shared values among all member states, the organization would deliver more efficiently on its mandate. but it has become clear that the united nations has evolved into a two-tier organization, reflecting a world that seems to be divided into two major categories: one considered to have inherent, laudable values, rights and liberties, and another that needs to be taught and coached on those values. my country and many in the developing world seem to fall into that second category. not only marginalized and disenfranchised, we are also considered chronic violators of our own human rights. the implication is that the united nations holds a certain standard for some countries, and another for others, especially on international issues concerning which every single member should be treated equally under the law. in my view, a debate between those two categories is urgently needed within the united nations membership so as to regain the noble founding ideals of the organization. no entity is better placed than our common united nations to bring equality and respect, despite disparities in economic status. the same situation pertains in the realm of international justice and the rule of law. rwanda subscribes to the principle that everyone and every state is accountable to laws and that the rule of law should govern us all. but these laws must truly be equally enforced and independently adjudicated. reaffirming the role of the united nations in global governance presupposes strengthening and reforming it to make it more effective and efficient in its response to global challenges. the impetus to reform our global governance structures, however, is the desire to ensure that they are equipped to deal with those challenges and secure a brighter future for all the citizens of the world. when there are no avenues for appealing international rulings, when there is an accountability deficit in key global institutions and when ordinary citizens feel that the united nations cannot deal adequately with the issues affecting their daily lives, the united nations cannot be seen as credible, relevant and democratic. we should make sure the organization does not become a tool for the powerful to protect their interests and enhance their influence or use it in subjugating others. 13 10-54965 rwanda believes in multilateralism and understands that global challenges can be effectively resolved only through international cooperation. the united nations must continue to be at the centre of that agenda and play its role without bias or prejudice. as we in rwanda continue to rebuild our country, we have become acutely aware of the need for lasting peace and security in our region and have worked hard to achieve it. we know that stability is the key prerequisite for our development and the improved lives of our citizens and our neighbours, and we have unreservedly committed ourselves to attaining it. we will continue to work in partnership with our neighbours, international and regional organizations and the african union to ensure that peace and security prevail and that africa fully realizes its potential. lastly, let me say that each of our countries, separately and collectively, has a duty to the people of the entire world, especially the most vulnerable.",Rwanda,Africa,65.8522720336914,4.631269931793213,759.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
MLI,65,2010,"it is a great privilege and signal honour for me to address the 10-55276 20 assembly on behalf of the president of the republic of mali, his excellency mr. amadou toumani toure, who, because of a very busy schedule resulting from the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of malis independence, is unable to be here with us today. he has expressly charged me with conveying to the assembly his sincere greetings and his wishes for every success for the work of this current session. at the outset i should like to convey to you, sir, the warmest congratulations of the delegation of mali on your election to the presidency of the general assembly at its sixty-fifth session. your election is a tribute to your eminent professional skills and is also an expression of the unanimous recognition given by the international community to the commitment of your country, switzerland, a friend of mali, to the ideals of our organization. i assure you of my delegations constant support in fulfilling your mandate. allow me also to express our deep appreciation to your predecessor, mr. ali abdussalam treki, for his deep commitment and the remarkable manner in which he guided our work during the sixty-fourth session of the general assembly. in turn, i commend the secretary- general, mr. ban ki-moon, for his constant efforts and his commitment to meeting the aims and objectives of this organization. on 28 september 1960, only a few days after the proclamation of independence, my country, mali, became a member of the united nations. today, on 28 september 2010, 50 years later, i, speaking to you from this selfsame rostrum, would like to reaffirm with force and conviction the commitment of the republic of mali to the promotion of the principles and purposes of the charter, the establishment of friendly relations with all nations of the world and the promotion of international cooperation, and to contributing to the dawning of a world of peace, justice and progress. indeed, today a new mali is on the rise. under the leadership of president amadou toumani toure, this new mali continues to progress towards the development and well-being of its people, each day further building upon the gains of peaceful democracy, recognized worldwide as being exemplary, and further enhances its presence in africa and on the international stage. today, on 28 september 2010, i convey here and now to the peoples of the world, to the governments of friendly countries, and to malis development partners, the greetings and gratitude of my country and reaffirm the solidarity and commitment of the republic of mali in our shared quest for a better world. this general debate has opened by setting out to tackle a timely subject, the reaffirmation of the central role of the united nations in global governance. in this regard, mali reiterates from the outset its faith in the capacity of the organization to be a catalyst in the processes of global democratization and governance. in that connection my country, mali, continues to call for a reform of the global economic and financial architecture, the only way to prevent the occurrence of even worse crises. in the same vein, mali believes that just and equitable representation of all regions of the world must be guaranteed within our organization, in particular through security council reform. in that regard, mali reaffirms its adherence to the ezulwini consensus and to the sirte declaration, adopted by the heads of state and government of the african union, and fully supports africas demand for two permanent seats and five non-permanent seats. a reformed council would better reflect the geopolitical realities of the world today, thus contributing towards repairing the historical injustices towards africa, the only region of the world not to have a permanent seat on the security council. in the same spirit mali, together with all other member states, will strive to reinforce the effectiveness of the role of the council and to promote the revitalization of the general assembly. with only five years now to the 2015 deadline set to achieve the millennium development goals and in spite of the tireless efforts made by many developing countries, millions of people worldwide are still waiting for the millennium declaration to take concrete effect. the high-level plenary meeting on the millennium development goals, which has just concluded, would have been a useful opportunity for heads of states and government to evaluate the progress made in various areas, draw lessons from the best practices and define approaches towards meeting the millennium development goals by 2015. for its part, the republic of mali is resolutely committed to achieving the millennium development goals in a sustainable manner through the adoption of a 10-year plan for the years 2006-2015, and through the implementation of a strategic framework for growth and poverty reduction and a project for economic and 21 10-55276 social development, all of which focus in particular on agriculture and food security, education and health. from this rostrum i invite the international community to continue to support our efforts in implementing this range of economic and social development policies in mali, as we are encouraged by the results achieved in previous strategies. indeed, the implementation of such strategies has made it possible to increase the schooling rate from 64 per cent in 2002 to 80 per cent in 2008. mortality for children under the age of 5 has fallen from 229 per thousand in 2001 to 191 per thousand in 2006, while hiv/aids prevalence has fallen from 1.7 per cent in 2001 to 1.3 per cent in 2006. thus, mali deems it essential to expedite the implementation of the commitments made at key international conferences, particularly the monterrey international conference on financing for development, the brussels conference on the least developed countries, the barbados global conference on the sustainable development of small island developing states and the almaty conference on landlocked developing states. undoubtedly climate change poses one of the greatest challenges currently facing the international community. today more than ever, the survival of our planet is threatened by natural disasters caused by this phenomenon, which seriously affects the living conditions in developing countries such as my own through in our case the encroachment of the desert, the silting up of the niger river, the deterioration of our ecosystem, the shortening of the winter season and poor rainfall distribution. that is why mali will spare no effort to make its modest contribution towards finding a global and binding agreement on climate change. to that end, in november 2010 my country will host a regional forum on sustainable development. the aids pandemic continues to hamper development efforts in many countries and thus poses one of the greatest threats to the survival of humanity and global security. in keeping with the abuja declaration on hiv/aids, tuberculosis and other related infectious diseases, the brazzaville commitment for universal access to treatment in africa and the lome declaration on hiv/aids in africa, mali has launched a vast programme of multisectoral reform, both at the institutional and operational levels. that programme compels all the sectors, in particular the public, private and civil society sectors, to become better organized in order to better coordinate their activities to combat aids effectively and be held accountable to the nation. the new transnational threats of trafficking in drugs, arms, human beings and terrorism seriously jeopardize international peace and security. the international community must resolutely tackle those threats. that means acting quickly and effectively. as i underscored in the general assembly during the second review of the united nations global counter- terrorism strategy on 8 september 2010, mali has adopted a new strategy to combat the lack of security and terrorism. on the one hand, this new strategy seeks to strengthen national capacities through robust actions in the field of security and community development and on the other hand it seeks to promote effective regional cooperation with the unified commitment of states of the sahelo-saharan region and with the support of the international community. building on this same impetus, the president of the republic of mali, his excellency mr. amadou toumani toure, has taken the initiative of organizing a conference in mali on peace, security and development in the sahelo-saharan region. the maintenance of international peace and security has been and will remain one of the most pressing concerns of the international community. without peace there is no development or prosperity, nor will there be, and that is why mali remains firmly attached to the ideals of peace and stability, both within and beyond its borders. in this regard, we welcome the progress made in national reconstruction and reconciliation, in peacebuilding and in the process of democratic transition, in particular in guinea-bissau, the republic of guinea, cote divoire and the democratic republic of the congo. in the middle east, we reaffirm our solidarity with our brother palestinian people in their courageous struggle for the creation of an independent and sovereign state with al-quds al-sharif as its capital, and we have closely followed the evolving situation in that part of the world and continue to support the relevant resolutions of the united nations in this area. to conclude, i should like to reiterate our solidarity with the brotherly people of haiti, as they seek to rebuild their country, and to express our deep sympathy to the victims of the natural disasters that have afflicted china, india, pakistan, russia and other 10-55276 22 countries, in particular in africa. millions of people worldwide continue to place their hopes in the united nations, and, as the community of nations, we do not have the right to let them down. it is our obligation to guarantee sustainable development for future generations and to preserve them from the scourge of war.",Mali,Africa,31.0997505187988,3.343889951705933,1624.0,9.0,0.0,9.0,5.541871921182266
ZMB,65,2010,"i stand before this assembly as an envoy of his excellency mr. rupiah bwezani banda, president of the republic of zambia. zambia wishes to align itself with the statement delivered by his excellency ngwazi professor bingu wa mutharika, president of the republic of malawi and current chairperson of the african union. this session is taking place amid global challenges such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, environmental degradation, international terrorism, piracy, hiv/aids, extreme poverty and hunger, among others. it is an occasion for all member states to collectively engage in dialogue aimed at finding solutions to the challenges that our countries are facing, in order to contribute to the socio-economic development and well-being of our people. the assemblys theme this year is appropriate, as it provides an opportunity to reaffirm the central role of the united nations in global governance. the role of the united nations is felt in areas such as peacekeeping, security, human rights, the promotion of gender equality and the fight for social justice and equality. however, emerging global challenges, such as the recent financial and economic crisis, also call for a greater role for the united nations in global economic governance. in that regard, our government would like to see a strengthening and enhancing of capacity in the united nations to enable it to deal with some of those challenges. allow me to express zambias gratitude to the secretary-general for organizing the important high- level meetings that preceded the general debate. the summit to review the millennium development goals (mdgs) provided an opportunity for the international community to take stock of existing gaps and the challenges faced in the attainment of the mdgs. at that meeting i elaborated on the progress zambia has made and the challenges we continue to face in our efforts to attain the mdgs. in spite of the strides made in improving the macroeconomic environment and putting in place development frameworks, the incidence of poverty in my country remains high, partly because our efforts alone are not enough. i therefore wish to reiterate calls to the international cooperating partners to honour all of their commitments to ensure that the 2015 targets are realized. let me also add that the measures that the zambian government has adopted to address the issue of hunger and poverty include devising agricultural sector policies that enable smallholder farming 10-55128 56 households to improve their productivity. in that connection, this year zambia has recorded a bumper harvest of maize, which is our main food crop. that will ensure food security and increased incomes for smallholder farmers, who constitute the majority of the farming community. we are mindful, however, of the fact that climate change, as evidenced by persistent periods of droughts and floods in our countries, poses one of the most serious threats to the agricultural sector and thus to overall food production. while as a government we are doing everything possible, such as investing in agricultural research and irrigation methods, the debate on climate change should not lose sight of the need to assist developing countries, including zambia, in building capacities to adapt in order to mitigate negative impacts on the agricultural sector. without those, poverty and hunger will persist in my country. zambia shares the concerns of the secretary- general regarding current global resource loss and ecosystem degradation. it is important that mankind reverse the ongoing trends of natural resource loss and ecosystem degradation as a commitment to protect biodiversity. that will be achieved only if all stakeholders step up their efforts and meet the mdgs and other internationally agreed development goals. my delegation welcomes the positive developments that have occurred in the past year in the area of arms control and disarmament. the security councils convening of a summit to address disarmament issues, the secretary-generals launch of a five-point nuclear disarmament proposal, the entry into force of treaties establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in central asia and africa, and the convening of a summit in washington to discuss nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, among others, must indeed be commended. we hope those efforts and the momentum generated will be sustained and will lead to the resolution of all outstanding issues in the area of disarmament. zambia, however, continues to face difficulties in controlling the inflow of small arms and light weapons. the illicit trade in small arms threatens security and retards social and economic development in our country. zambia therefore calls for the establishment of a strong and legally binding international instrument on the arms trade. we strongly support the convening of the united nations conference in 2012 to establish legally binding common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms, with specific measures against defaulters. on the reform of the united nations, in particular the security council, zambia reaffirms its support for the african position, as espoused in the ezulwini consensus and the sirte declaration, that africa should be granted, among others, not less than two permanent seats, with all of the prerogatives and privileges including the right of veto, and two additional non-permanent seats. africa is the only continent without permanent seats, and yet it has the second largest membership of the united nations. granting africa permanent seats will redress that historical injustice. the government of zambia recognizes the important role that women play in attaining development. furthermore, we recognize that the empowerment of women and their inclusion in the decision-making process have enhanced their role in development. that is why zambia has integrated women of all sectors of society in decision-making positions, and we are committed to doing even more. our government welcomes the establishment of un women, the united nations entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women, and the appointment of ms. michelle bachelet, the former president of chile, to head it. it is our hope that the new entity will have a strong and effective presence at country level and will help member states implement standards and will provide them with the much-needed financial and technical support required to achieve womens empowerment, equality and equity. as the assembly is aware, zambia has been hosting refugees prior to and since its independence in 1964 and is party to all refugee conventions. my country was among the first on the african continent to host a refugee camp. zambia is committed to hosting refugees, and our experience has demonstrated that voluntary repatriation is a desirable and durable solution. however, as an under-resourced and least developed country, hosting refugees is a major challenge for us. we therefore call upon the international community to provide financial assistance to enable us to discharge that responsibility through the provision of minimum standards of care. in addition to the question of refugees, the issue of internally displaced persons, which has continued to increase worldwide, especially in africa, equally calls 57 10-55128 for our attention. the adoption by the african union last year of the convention for the protection and assistance of internally displaced persons in africa is an important landmark that requires the support of the international community at large. the sanctions imposed on zimbabwe continue to cause great suffering to the people of that country and to the southern africa region as a whole. similarly, the embargo that the united states has imposed on cuba, which the united nations has condemned through numerous general assembly resolutions, has caused untold hardship to the people of cuba. zambia calls on this body to ensure that the sanctions on zimbabwe and the united states embargo on cuba are lifted. in an effort to consolidate democratic governance, zambia is in the process of enacting a new constitution. the national constitutional conference that was established to oversee the process concluded its work and submitted a draft constitution, which awaits tabling before parliament. as the assembly may be aware, zambia will hold presidential and general elections in 2011. as in the past, international election observers, including those from the united nations, will be invited. as we reaffirm the role of the united nations in global governance, let us not be complacent in the face of great suffering and hardship in our world. let that be the force that drives us to action, where all nations will work together in meeting the goals and aspirations of our peoples.",Zambia,Africa,83.0076675415039,3.416004453937385,1376.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.4534883720930232
CAF,65,2010,"the central african republic would like, through me, to commend mr. joseph deiss on his election to the presidency of the general assembly at its sixty-fifth session. we congratulate him and offer him our support in fulfilling his great responsibility. his predecessor, mr. ali abdussalam treki of the libyan arab jamahiriya, also deserves our heartfelt commendation and gratitude for the outstanding contribution he made during his term of office in revitalizing the general assembly. lastly, on behalf of his excellency army general francois bozize, president and head of state of our country, allow me to convey our sincere congratulations to secretary- general ban ki-moon, who has been tireless in carrying out his extremely important role to promote the ideals of the organization. the sixty-fifth session is taking place at a time when the world faces many challenges. in addition to the armed conflicts that affect almost every continent, there are also the food, energy and financial crises, which have made the lives of the most vulnerable people increasingly precarious. there are also challenges when it comes to respect for human rights, the rule of law and good governance, which are the foundations of lasting peace and security and a healthy environment. today, we are aware that systematic violations of human rights and the glaring absence of the rule of law are often the root causes of conflicts and other social crises. states and non-state actors confront each other. warlords, terrorists and criminal gangs dictate their own rules. civilians, rather than soldiers, become the first targets. security policy can no longer be confined to the traditional framework of the state; it must be focused first and foremost on the security of individuals. as the president rightly said in his opening speech to this session of the general assembly by way of referring to the special theme for the sixty-fifth session, we must reinstate the united nations and the general assembly at the centre of global governance. the challenges we face today have acquired a global dimension and require global solutions. (a/65/pv.1) the central african republic continues to believe that preventing and peacefully resolving conflicts are the best way to maintain international peace and security. many other challenges also require the attention of the international community. we should provide responses tailored to those challenges in order that together we can build a better world, starting with the issue of climate change. today more than ever before, the survival of the planet is threatened by changes to the climate that have a serious impact on living conditions in developing countries owing mainly to desertification, the silting 10-55128 46 up of rivers, ecosystem deterioration, shortened winters and floods. faced with that danger, it is not a matter of raising questions about respective responsibilities; we must rather, first and foremost, put in place suitable emergency measures to confront the challenge. in that connection, the outcomes of the bali conference are as relevant as ever and they should be implemented. although, unfortunately, the copenhagen summit was the scene of selfishness and inconsistency on the part of states vis-a-vis international cooperation and climate policy, we hope that the upcoming meeting at cancun, mexico, will find appropriate answers to those worrying issues. the hiv/aids and malaria pandemics are another challenge to which we must give particular attention, as they pose a serious threat to the survival of humankind, in particular on the african continent. with regard to hiv/aids, we must truly redouble our efforts and determination to implement the 2001 declaration of commitment on hiv/aids and the outcomes of the high-level meetings on aids. child and maternal mortality rates in africa, whose increase is yet another cause for concern, should also enjoy the same attention as the other issues. all of those meetings have emphasized the gravity of the situation, underscoring the importance of acting and the need to mobilize resources accordingly to fight those health threats. achieving millennium development goal 1 on time namely, reducing by half the number of people who suffer from hunger by 2015 compels us to put in place a new approach and policy towards international cooperation that is based on support for agriculture, rather than on providing food assistance, which should only be provided in exceptional circumstances, and then in a timely manner. developing agriculture in africa so that it provides for lasting food security also necessarily entails controlling water, the availability of equipment, access to raw materials for producers and proper organization of the means of producing, storing, transforming and marketing agricultural products. the central african republic, a country endowed with abundant natural resources, would easily be able to take its place as an agricultural country, were it not for the handicaps it faces owing to its landlocked status and the scarcity of means at its disposal. agriculture in my country is essentially a subsistence affair that performs poorly despite the countrys enormous potential. that includes 15 million arable hectares, of which only 600,000 are cultivated annually, as well as 16 million hectares of range land for a herd of 2 million animals. we also have at our disposal a vast network of rivers and streams, as well as abundant rainfall amounting to 1,200 to 1,800 millimetres per year. agriculture employs more than 75 per cent of working people in our country, contributing about 53 per cent of our gross domestic product. in the central african republic, about 72 per cent of the poor and hungry live in rural areas, where agriculture plays a crucial role, feeding communities but providing employment that offers only meagre incomes. nevertheless, in spite of the enormity of the need and the growing food insecurity, assistance to agriculture continues to decrease, having dropped significantly in the past 20 years. the central african republic has maintained the strengthening of human capital as one of its priorities under the fourth pillar of its national poverty-reduction strategy. under that pillar, education, health and employment are considered priority sectors, in line with the millennium development goals. assessments of the programmes that have been launched seem to reveal shortcomings in the results. for instance, adult literacy rates are poor, at 57 per cent, while the overall primary school attendance rate is also low, at 55 per cent. the central african republic is among the countries of the world most affected by the hiv/aids pandemic, even though we are continuing efforts to bring its prevalence under control. given those outcomes, it is clear that, if our country is to pursue the implementation of the priorities of our development plan, we need significant support from our development partners. with regard to nuclear disarmament, the proliferation crisis we are experiencing constitutes the greatest threat to international peace and security today. nuclear disarmament and nuclear proliferation in all their aspects should be at the centre of our debate. we should resolve to prioritize the use of nuclear energy for peaceful civilian purposes. today more than ever before, the interconnectedness of the crises faced by the 47 10-55128 international community underscores the need to inject new impetus into efforts to achieve international peace and security, including collective efforts at the international level. with regard to reforming the united nations system, the central african republic shares the view that the current system no longer reflects the ambitions of the founders. our country therefore once again calls for full representation for africa in the systems decision-making bodies, in particular the security council. whatever the outcome of the ongoing negotiations on this matter, my delegation continues to believe that any viable reform of the security council must take into account africas numerical and political significance in the general assembly, especially given the two types of situations considered by the council. the central african republic held elections in 2005, which were heralded by the international community for having met all the necessary standards. it should be pointed out that those held in 2010 experienced various difficulties that need to be examined. therefore, on the basis of a political consensus, the national assembly adopted a law based on a constitutional court opinion. this constitutional arrangement extends the term of office of our countrys president, as well as those of members of the assembly, until the holding of elections, now set for 23 january 2011. in another area, the programme for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants has made considerable progress in the central and north-western parts of our country. nevertheless, the central african republic continues to face security problems in the north-east of the country, as a result of the consequences of the conflict in darfur, as well as in the south-east, owing to the raging ugandan rebellion by the lords resistance army (lra). this alarming situation has resulted in a growing number of refugees and internally displaced persons from various areas, who have fled to the cities from the fighting. having been pushed out of uganda, lra rebels have regrouped in the south-east of our country, where they carry out all sorts of violence and spread terror among the people. it is important to point out that the central african republic does not have any borders with uganda. the central african republic therefore welcomes the decision by the united states government with regard to disarming the lra. nevertheless, we hope that the united states administration will focus in particular on the case of the central african republic, which is a post-conflict country that still needs united states assistance, given the danger posed by the lra on the ground in our country and the disastrous social consequences it has already had. the united nations mission in the central african republic and chad, whose mandate will expire on 31 december 2010, requires particular attention. the central african republics defence and security forces will take over from international forces in order to ensure the continuity of operations. however, they are in desperate need of military equipment and supplies. the government of the central african republic therefore appeals to the international community for assistance in strengthening the operational capacities of our armed forces. i cannot conclude without once again thanking all those whose commitment, courage and determination continue to be of assistance in helping my country to emerge from crisis to lasting peace and development.",Central African Republic,Africa,36.7526092529297,1.117609977722168,1703.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.7615971814445097
TUN,65,2010,"first, sir, i warmly congratulate you and the friendly swiss confederation on your election as president of the general assembly at its sixty-fifth session, and wish you every success in your noble mission. we are convinced that your great political and diplomatic experience will provide the best conditions for the success of this session and enrich its contents. this will help achieve the objectives and aspirations we all cherish, especially as regards the theme of the general debate: reaffirming the central role of the united nations in global governance. i take this opportunity to renew my congratulations to mr. ali abdussalam treki and to the sisterly great socialist peoples libyan arab jamahiriya, for his valuable efforts as president at the sixty-fourth session, his deep knowledge of international affairs and his wise approach in dealing with crucial, complex and delicate issues, thus serving the interests of our peoples and nations and enhancing the role of the general assembly in international relations. i also wish to express my great respect to mr. ban ki-moon, the secretary-general, for his commendable efforts at the head of the secretariat to further enhance the position of our prestigious organization and promote its performance, so that it can meet the many challenges posed on the international scene. in this context, tunisia reaffirms its support for all the efforts of the secretary-general, and of the united nations in general, to promote peace, stability, security and development in all countries of the world. tunisia highly values the important historic step made during the previous session in the process of reforming the united nations. i refer to the adoption of resolution 64/289, which reaffirms the importance we all attach to the development of the united nations system and the promotion of complementarity between its activities and programmes. that applies especially to those pertaining to women, for whom a new unified entity has been created to deal with all issues related to gender equality and the empowerment of women. i take this opportunity to renew our congratulations to its head, ms. bachelet. we wish her every success. under the leadership of president zine el abidine ben ali, tunisia attaches crucial importance to these issues. women, in fact, have a strategic role in our civilizational project, and are considered a partner in making all our national choices. tunisia strongly believes that democracy cannot be built, and comprehensive development cannot be achieved, without the active involvement of women in public life, and that promoting society to higher levels depends on enhancing the conditions of women in all fields. this conviction stems from our vision of human rights in their comprehensiveness, inseparability and complementarity. the prestigious status that tunisian women enjoy today is confirmed by figures and indicators pertaining to human development and womens involvement in all fields. they now represent 30 per cent of the countrys working population. they hold 30 per cent of decision- making positions and other positions of responsibility. they represent 33 per cent of the judicial corps judges and lawyers and 42 per cent of the medical corps. in higher education, girls account for 60 per cent of the total number of students. in the legislative branch, womens presence has been reinforced to reach 30 per cent in the chamber of deputies and 16 per cent in the chamber of advisers. it is indeed a source of pride for tunisia to be ranked first internationally in terms of fighting violence against women and guaranteeing their right to free movement and ownership of property, to be ranked first in the arab world in terms of offering women opportunities for economic participation, and to be ranked first in africa in terms of womens per capita income. the tunisian presidency of the arab women organization (awo), in the person of tunisias first lady, is in line with that approach. mrs. leila ben ali 7 10-55276 has endeavoured to spread the culture of gender equality, to further improve the condition of women in arab societies, to allow them to enjoy their rights and accomplish their duties, and to preserve their dignity. all this, in fact, constitutes a civilizational and strategic stake and an integral part of the concept of arab national security and human security in all its dimensions. as part of the various pioneering initiatives and activities of the arab women organization, tunisia will next month host the third awo conference, with the theme the arab woman, a partner in sustainable development. since the change of 7 november 1987, tunisia has adopted a comprehensive and balanced development policy based on the inseparability of the economic and social dimensions, a policy that reconciles the requirements of an economy based on the principles of profitability and efficiency and an equitable social policy in which there is no room for exclusion or marginalization, guaranteeing a decent life for all citizens. the electoral programme of president zine el abidine ben ali for the 2009-2014 term of office, together we meet the challenges, and the five-year development plan for the period 2010-2014 have both made a reality of those choices, reflecting a determination to further enhance the process of democracy and pluralism, to move political life in tunisia towards further modernity and continuous reform, and to launch a new process of development based on the economy of knowledge and intelligence. as part of that ambitious, future-oriented plan, tunisia has attached crucial importance to youth as the pillar of the present and the builder of the future, through regularly organizing national youth consultations to explore the concerns, expectations and views of young people. the results of those consultations are taken into consideration in preparing development plans. furthermore, tunisia proclaimed 2008 the year of comprehensive dialogue with tunisian youth. that event, with massive participation by different youth categories, was crowned with the adoption of a youth pact signed by all the national organizations concerned and the elite of tunisian youth. keen on consecrating this policy at the international level and on involving the world community in supporting it, our country launched during the previous session of the general assembly an initiative to proclaim 2010 international year of youth, to consolidate the position of youth in all societies of the world, youth being at the forefront of the forces of progress embracing noble universal values. tunisia expresses its deep pride over member states unanimous support for this initiative, which the general assembly adopted in resolution 64/134. tunisia also takes pride in the fact that on 12 august the secretary-general himself chaired the launch of the festivities celebrating the international year of youth; he did so at headquarters, in the presence of hundreds of representatives of the worlds youth. tunisia calls on all governments, international and regional organizations, and youth institutions, to establish adequate plans of action, programmes and activities to celebrate the international year of youth in a way that makes a reality of its motto, dialogue and mutual understanding, and leads to the adoption of an international pact to bind the worlds youth to common universal values. i take this opportunity to express tunisias appreciation for the initiatives of turkey, singapore and mexico in organizing important international youth events last august. throughout its modern history, tunisia has remained committed to the principles and values of peaceful coexistence, good-neighbourliness, fraternity and mutual support. it has tirelessly endeavoured to promote relations of fraternity, friendship and cooperation with all peace-loving countries, and has invariably advocated peace, security and justice in the world. since the change of november 1987, tunisia has given particular attention to the promotion of relations of fraternity and cooperation with arab maghreb countries, based on its strong belief in the unity of destiny and the inevitability of maghreb integration. while reaffirming its adherence to the arab maghreb union as a historic gain and an irrevocable strategic choice, tunisia is committed to pursuing efforts jointly with sisterly maghreb countries to realize the aspirations of the maghreb peoples for complementarity, integration and solidarity. this commitment stems from a deep common civilizational, historic and geographic belonging, and is imposed by the successive economic fluctuations and the deep and ever-accelerating changes taking place in our world today in all political, social and cultural fields. at the arab level, tunisia will firmly pursue its efforts to promote joint arab action and establish solid 10-55276 8 foundations for an efficient inter-arab economic complementarity. tunisia has continuously played an efficient role in dealing with arab causes, in the forefront of which is the palestinian cause, through its firm and unwavering position supporting the brotherly palestinian people at all stages of their legitimate struggle, and calling for a fair, durable and comprehensive solution that can put an end to the suffering of our palestinian brothers and allow them to recover their legitimate national rights and establish their independent state on their land. in this context, tunisia expresses its deep concern about the situation in the middle east, as a result of israels disrespect for international legality and the basic principles of the peace process, its persistence in the settlement policy and its attempts to obliterate the arab-muslim identity of the city of al-quds al-sharif. tunisia expresses its hope that the resumption of direct peace talks, launched on 2 september in washington under the sponsorship of the united states, will meet the legitimate aspirations of the brotherly palestinian people. we also call on all the influential parties on the international scene, particularly the quartet, to act to bring israel to adhere to the requirements of peace, on the basis of international legality, the principles of the peace process, and the arab peace initiative, and in accordance with a specific time schedule that covers all the relevant main points. tunisia also reiterates its call for an end to the israeli occupation of the syrian golan and the remaining occupied lebanese territories, in accordance with international legality, so that all the peoples of the region can enjoy security and peace, and devote their efforts to construction and development for a better future. moreover, tunisia hopes that the efforts made will promote peace and security in iraq, yemen, the sudan and somalia, within a climate of unity and national harmony. tunisia attaches particular importance to its belonging to africa, based on its belief in the importance of its integration in its geographic environment and the expansion of the fields of cooperation and solidarity with sisterly african countries. since the 7 november change, our country has endeavoured to realize this policy by reaffirming its commitment to the principles of the african union, and continuously supporting all initiatives aimed at promoting the continent, achieving development for its peoples, and preserving its potentialities, within a climate of security and stability. tunisia has spared no effort to contribute to the promotion of peace and security in the african continent, through participating in united nations peacekeeping operations, supporting conflict- prevention mechanisms, and continuously acting for the eradication of hotbeds of tension. moreover, our country has continuously called on african countries to play an active role and to find adequate solutions to their problems through activating the central organ of the mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution, the first regional experience of preventive diplomacy, then through the african peace and security council, which has helped re-establish stability in a number of sisterly african countries. we reaffirm tunisias support for all the efforts of the african union, which proclaimed 2010 the year of peace and security in africa, so that peace and stability would reign all over the continent, which is a responsibility of the international community as a whole. in line with those principles and with the millennium development goals (mdgs), tunisia calls on developed nations to act promptly to meet the needs of the african continent and of developing countries in general, by using the existing international and regional mechanisms to ensure decent living standards for african peoples. i take this opportunity to stress the need to activate the world solidarity fund, created by the general assembly in 2002, upon tunisias initiative, to serve as an efficient international mechanism for sustainable development, capable of achieving the mdgs, particularly the goal of reducing the poverty rate by half by 2015. at the euro-mediterranean level, europe is currently an essential partner of tunisia in various fields. our country has time-honoured historic relations with europe. yet we consider that our relations still need to be further enhanced and developed, through an equitable, solidarity-based partnership that rests on mutual respect and is in line with our strategic and civilizational choices in terms of political reform and 9 10-55276 economic, social and cultural development. this will strengthen the ties of cooperation and solidarity, and help reduce disparities between the countries and peoples of the two shores of the mediterranean. on the basis of those principles tunisia supported the establishment of the union for the mediterranean, a promising initiative that can create a new dynamism in euro-mediterranean relations, promote a positive interaction to meet the coming challenges, and enhance security and stability in our mediterranean region. tunisia is endeavouring to respond positively to the huge changes occurring on the international scene, by developing the mechanisms of consultation and cooperation with all the american and asian countries. our country attaches great importance to the promotion of its relations with large regional blocs in the american and asian continents, so as to enrich cooperation and explore new fields for a strong partnership serving mutual interests. in this context, at the end of this year tunisia will host the japan-arab economic forum. it will also host, in 2012, the fifth ministerial meeting of the china-arab cooperation forum. tunisia is also keen on promoting rapprochement with south american countries, within an arab or african framework. the values of mutual support and solidarity, which constitute the pillar of our countrys policy and orientation, and which have now become a deeply- anchored tradition, demand that we give immediate assistance to countries stricken by natural disasters, which cause thousands of deaths in many countries of the world. tunisia has responded promptly to the urgent calls by the secretary-general to help disaster- stricken countries, such as pakistan, which was recently ravaged by floods, and haiti, which early this year was hit by a devastating earthquake, in which tunisia and the united nations lost one of their eminent diplomats, known for his great competence and generous devotion, the late hedi annabi, head of the united nations stabilization mission in haiti. today, the world urgently needs to adopt an efficient policy to protect the environment, so as to spare humanity the adverse consequences of climate change, which over the past three decades has caused the international community huge economic losses. the assembly is certainly aware that climate change has a serious impact on stability in many countries, given the many problems caused, especially by global warming, drought and floods, and the resulting degradation of harvests and scarcity of water resources. once again, tunisia underlines the need to accelerate the pace of international talks on climate change, while giving priority to human interests over economic benefits, so as to reach an agreement guaranteeing that a minimum of measures will be taken to meet the huge challenges posed by climate change, particularly in the developing and the least developed countries. tunisia calls for the establishment of a decisive intervention programme to help remedy the effects of climate change and the problems it causes in terms of ecosystems, farming policies, and international food security in general. in this context, tunisia reiterates its support for the african position and underlines the importance of helping african countries to face the effects of climate change. tunisia commends the attention given by japan and korea to this issue. we hope that the forthcoming mexico summit will produce positive results that can help achieve the objectives in this vital field. at the present session the assembly has devoted a large part of its agenda to the evaluation of our countries achievements in the implementation of the mdgs, five years before 2015. implementing the goals and meeting the challenges resulting from the new world order, with the deep changes that it has generated, require that we step up action to embody the principles of the charter in international relations, and to anchor the culture of dialogue and the values of tolerance, civilizational communication and solidarity among peoples. tunisia reaffirms its determination to continue actively contributing to joint international action to find adequate, fair and durable solutions to current problems, through joining in all efforts based on dialogue, mutual respect, consensus and mutual support within the framework of the united nations. that is the ideal framework for international action to promote security, peace and stability in the world, so that our peoples can apply all their efforts and capacities for comprehensive and sustainable development and for realizing their legitimate aspirations for prosperity and a decent standard of living. the current international situation can only strengthen our adherence to the united nations and its founding principles, and bolster our determination to 10-55276 10 reaffirm its central role in meeting challenges and to confer more efficiency on its activities and programmes, given its pivotal role in global governance. in this regard, tunisia hopes that member states will reach the largest possible consensus for introducing the necessary reforms into the united nations system, especially as regards the composition of the security council, and for giving more transparency and efficiency to the organizations performance; that is in addition to further enhancing the role of the general assembly, which includes all the member states, and that of the economic and social council. to conclude, i once again wish all success to the assembly at the current session, at which we hope it will make constructive recommendations that serve all the peoples of the world, promote peace and stability, offer wider prospects for progress and prosperity, and help meet challenges with confidence and efficiency.",Tunisia,Africa,79.1305770874023,5.963069915771484,2977.0,15.0,0.0,15.0,5.0386294927779645
SWZ,65,2010,"it is a pleasure for me to address the general assembly at its sixty-fifth session. we meet following the historic review summit on the millennium development goals (mdgs), the high- level plenary meeting of the assembly, which gave us the opportunity to review progress and share experiences and ideas on how best to achieve our set goals and objectives for 2015. as we return to our respective countries we go with renewed commitment to keep working harder to meet the mdgs. i would like at the outset to extend our thanks and appreciation to the secretary-general and the united nations agencies for their presence around the world. we commend the active participation of the united nations in various missions, such as efforts to restore peace in conflict areas, and its role in disaster relief and in various exercises to fight hunger and poverty. we pledge ourselves to continue to support the united nations in its primary role of ensuring that all the nations of the world live peacefully with each other while supporting nation-building through development projects. the theme for this sixty-fifth session, reaffirming the central role of the united nations in global governance, came at a most opportune time in 7 10-55103 the life of the united nations, since we have been calling for all our voices to be heard. i must hasten to state that all the wars and conflicts that we see around the world can only be resolved through peaceful dialogue and negotiations. the united nations is the organization best positioned for this task. there is no place for unilateralism. it is on this basis that the kingdom of eswatini reaffirms our call for the finalization of the united nations reforms, with particular reference to the security council. it should be appreciated that the world today faces a new set of challenges, different from those that it faced when our organization was founded in 1945; thus the urgent need for the united nations to remain dynamic and transform itself to meet todays challenges. one of the major organs that require immediate reform is the security council, which has seen a number of regions expressing a desire to gain membership, to ensure wider representation. the kingdom of eswatini stands by the african position, as clearly stated in the ezulwini consensus, that africa should have two permanent and five non-permanent seats. we hope that during this session this matter will be finalized. we in the african continent are committed to resolving all conflicts through peaceful dialogue. the coordination and cooperation between the african union and its various regional blocs is beginning to pay handsome dividends. we now approach issues as a collective for better results. we are happy that the united nations continues to work and cooperate with us in effecting our programmes for peacebuilding and peacekeeping. the general assembly will know that the african union declared 2010 to be our year of peace and security. we have made it clear that all perpetrators of coups and civil wars and all forms of conflict should be dealt with squarely and decisively. indeed, we are committed to the promotion of lasting peace, because it is a prerequisite for achieving sustainable development. we appreciate the support of the united nations in our resolve to ensure that peace prevails in the continent and, indeed, the whole world. i am happy to say that i personally had the honour of lighting and hoisting the african flame of peace twice this year. the swazi nation prides itself on this, because we are a peaceful nation, which is telling the world that peace is the best formula for development. another issue that touches upon global governance is that of the kingdom of morocco. it is our considered view that the united nations, working with relevant regional organizations, should work on the issue and find a lasting solution. we note with concern the continued conflicts in madagascar, somalia, darfur, the middle east and afghanistan, to mention just a few. we call for the restoration of peace in all those areas, as it is always disturbing to see people undergo so much suffering due to conflicts. while afghanistan is still undergoing its process of reconciliation and the reconstruction of its institutions, it is depressing to note that there are at times pockets that seem to disturb the peace process in that country. we must continue to work hard to find lasting solutions, because such instability affects peace and prosperity, not only in afghanistan, but also in neighbouring states and the region. the kingdom of eswatini draws hope from the promising developments in iraq, as that country continues on the road to peace through restoration of its important institutions for self-determination. furthermore, we are also following with keen interest efforts to ensure peace between israel and palestine. we are pleased to note the concerted mediation efforts led by the united states of america in bringing the parties together in pursuit of peace in the middle east. we support this process, and remain optimistic that it will reach its desired conclusion, so that the israelis and palestinians can live together in harmony. in order to concentrate all their efforts towards development and peaceful coexistence, we call upon them to reach a compromise and place the best interests of peace and security above everything else. developments in cross-straits relations between the republic of china on taiwan and the peoples republic of china continue to be a source of inspiration to us all. we note with appreciation that the republic of china on taiwan and the peoples republic of china have made impressive strides to promote mutual understanding leading to more trade and interaction between them. i am happy to say that taiwan highly appreciates being allowed to participate as an observer in the world health organization. 10-55103 8 hopefully, this will also lead to taiwans participating in a similar manner in all other united nations agencies. of particular interest is the united nations framework convention on climate change. our world today continues to be concerned about nuclear proliferation and the threat that weapons of mass destruction pose to human existence, world peace, economic development and the environment. the spread of nuclear weapons makes a mockery of our efforts for world peace and protection of the environment. it is a disheartening fact that currently efforts to ensure accountability and compliance with united nations resolutions are hindered by an apparent lack of impartiality in the processes meant to completely rid the world of deadly nuclear weapons. i call upon the united nations to strengthen the capacity of the international atomic energy agency to enable the inspectors to do their work more effectively, with the involvement of all the countries with nuclear capability. the united nations must never compromise the implementation of the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons; it must ensure that all countries, without exception, comply. countries must be made to comply and be accountable within clear time frames. it is my suggestion that we eliminate all weapons of mass destruction, because they present an uncertain future. indeed, we need a fresh start so that we may regain the moral high ground in deterring whoever may have ambitions for nuclear capability in the future. for example, if we compel everyone to dismantle their nuclear capacity we will be able to rein in other countries which may still be developing their arsenal, without being accused of unfairness or bias. a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction will allow us to concentrate on issues of sustainable development. as a developing nation, the kingdom of eswatini is following with keen interest the issues surrounding the effects of climate change. as an agriculture-based economy, the kingdom is also a victim of environmental degradation. we therefore look forward to the climate change conference to be held in mexico later this year. i trust that the ongoing negotiations will result in agreements acceptable to all parties. what is of paramount importance is for the developed world to honour pledges to assist developing countries in their mitigation and adaptation efforts. it is a known fact that access to international markets for our products is one of the ways to grow our economies in our quest to eradicate poverty. we are encouraged that the developed nations have opened their markets for some products from developing countries. we look forward with optimism to an amicable conclusion of the doha round of talks, an outcome essential to boost global trade and economic recovery for the developing world. as part of our development and poverty alleviation strategy, the kingdom is ready to explore and exploit existing and emerging markets. our focus is on limiting exportation of raw material by emphasizing the production of finished goods. the kingdom continues to promote equality in all sectors of our development spheres. we therefore welcome the recent establishment of the new united nations entity for gender equality: un women. women the world over continue to play key roles in contributing to the socio-economic and political development of our nations. we are meeting as a family of nations that seeks to promote peace and coexistence among all nations of the world and bring hope for the future. our people look to us, as leaders, to take the lead in promoting peace, as enshrined in the charter. we must find lasting solutions to all the challenges. they include poverty, unemployment, disease and global warming, but the major challenge is to make peace within and among all nations happen. by finding solutions, we shall indeed guarantee a clear road towards the achievement of sustainable development by all the nations of the world. we shall achieve that noble goal if we all reaffirm and adhere to the central role of the united nations in global governance.",Eswatini,Africa,83.0982894897461,6.118370056152344,1632.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.2254901960784315
GIN,65,2010,"i have the honour to speak before the general assembly to convey the warm greetings of the people and government of guinea, and most especially that of his excellency general sekouba konate, interim president of the republic, president of the transition. on this happy occasion, i would first of all like to congratulate you, sir, on your election to the presidency of the sixty-fifth session of the general assembly. i wish you every success and assure you in advance of my 23 10-55396 delegations support. your undeniable personal qualities, in conjunction with proven ability, will certainly inspire our work at a time when our organization faces numerous challenges involving the entire international community. i would also like to extend our gratitude to your predecessor, mr. abdussalam treki, for the skill and dedication that he showed in carrying out his mandate. here, we would like to express our gratitude to our secretary-general, mr. ban ki-moon, for his tireless efforts to promote the noble ideals of the united nations and, in particular, for his personal involvement in settling the crisis in my country. on assuming power on 23 december 2008 against a background of political and economic crisis, the new guinean authorities had to deal with many difficulties, in particular poor governance, state crimes, widespread insecurity and the proliferation and circulation of small arms and light weapons. that worrying situation led to the adoption of various measures to restore order and security, build national unity and establish a regime respectful of human rights and individual and public freedoms. in that specific context, the agreement signed in ouagadougou on 15 january 2010 enabled the people of guinea, of all inclinations, to embark on a path of peace and dialogue and implement a political plan ensuring the return to constitutional order based on the rule of law and good governance. despite pitfalls, that process of democratization led to the establishment of transitional bodies, specifically, a government of national unity, led by a prime minister, a head of government coming from the forces vives, the national transitional council and the independent national electoral commission, as well as a timetable setting the deadline for organizing free and transparent elections. in a show of great commitment, following the adoption of the new constitution, the people turned out in force on 27 june 2010 for the most free and democratic presidential election that the country had known since its independence in 1958. the second round of that important election is planned for the coming weeks. here, from this rostrum, i would like to launch an urgent appeal to the african and international communities to continue to support guinea with a view to strengthening peace, stability and security in the subregion. i would also like to pay warm tribute to the facilitator, his excellency mr. blaise compaore, president of burkina faso, for his tireless efforts to promote the democratic process in guinea. i also extend that tribute to the international contact group on guinea and, through it, the member states of the economic community of west african states and of the african union, the international community and all friendly countries that are working with us at this critical time. peace and security continue to be threatened in some parts of the african continent and the world. somalia continues to be subject to a fratricidal and painful war. in the sudan, peace remains fragile despite the huge sacrifices and the investments granted. we urge the african union and the international community to continue their efforts for a prompt and lasting settlement of those conflicts. in cote divoire, the recent political developments have made it possible for that friendly neighbouring country to move towards the presidential election planned for 31 october. that important step forward, in conjunction with the positive outcomes of the peacebuilding process in sierra leone and liberia, give us real cause for encouragement and hope for the peoples of the mano river union. with regard to western sahara, my government supports the efforts of the united nations and remains firmly committed to the moroccan initiative on the negotiation of a status of autonomy for the sahara region. it urges the stakeholders to find a lasting and mutually beneficial political solution. the upsurge in threats and terrorist violence in africa are a source of serious concern to guinea. my country supports the prompt establishment of a consultative framework for action to eradicate that scourge. in the middle east, my delegation welcomes the direct talks between the palestinian authorities and the israeli government under the auspices of the united states of america. it hopes that those talks will lead to the establishment of an independent and sovereign palestinian state, living side by side in peace with israel. the guinean government believes that peace in that region can be achieved only in a climate of mutual trust and with a will to implement the agreements and relevant resolutions of the general assembly and the security council. from that viewpoint, israel must 10-55396 24 withdraw from the occupied palestinian territories and end its settlement policy. only a week ago, in this hall, the international community reiterated its commitment to the billions of people who are expecting it to make a reality of the promise of a better world expressed in the millennium declaration (resolution 55/2). guinea welcomes the holding of that summit, which allowed our heads of state and government and our partners to reaffirm their will to achieve the millennium development goals (mdgs) within the agreed time frame. my country remains convinced that achieving the millennium development goals is within reach. that is borne out by the remarkable progress made in many areas by countries that are among the poorest on the planet. barely five years from the 2015 deadline, we must step up the pace, particularly in the countries facing major challenges, in order to consolidate the achievements and make even more effective progress than we have to date. in order to take up the many challenges of the twenty-first century, development partners and the international community have no choice but to step up efforts to work together to lend new impetus to international cooperation. my country urges all stakeholders to assume, at the national, regional and international levels, their share of responsibility in achieving the millennium development goals. the republic of guinea welcomes the progress made in recent years with regard to official development assistance. however, it regrets that long- standing commitments and those entered into more recently are far from being met. it is vital to reflect on all standard and supplementary sources of financing for development. innovative financing is becoming an increasingly important means to mobilize additional, predictable and stable resources to supplement official development assistance. guinea, which attaches great importance to an increase in official development assistance, reiterates its proposal on organizing an african conference on innovative financing and drawing up a draft african declaration on transparency of financial governance and fighting illegal capital flows. the purpose of that conference would be to promote strategies to mobilize innovative financing as a complement to traditional aid and the domestic resources needed to fund the mdgs. the draft african declaration on transparency of financial governance and fighting illegal capital flows would seek to stem the immense capital outflows from africa by redirecting them towards development of the continent. those proposals were warmly welcomed by various african bodies and the leading group on innovative financing for development. they also received support at the twenty-fifth summit of heads of state and government of africa and france and the backing of the african union at its fifteenth summit in kampala. my delegation hopes that those initiatives will feature among the proposals for action on africa during this sixty-fifth session of the general assembly. regarding international trade, we hope for a prompt conclusion of the doha round negotiations on the basis of an agreement that is both far-reaching and fair to all stakeholders, in particular the least developed countries. we again call for developed countries to respect their commitment to remove by 2013 all export subsidies that significantly distort trade and agricultural production in developing countries. my country welcomes the substantial progress made with respect to debt relief and urges the international community to continue its endeavours to effectively implement the heavily indebted poor countries initiative. the subject of climate change quite rightly occupies a central place on the international agenda, given that phenomenons devastating effects. that reveals the emergence of a collective awareness and the real threat that that phenomenon poses to humankind. given that urgency, my country calls for concerted and courageous international efforts to alleviate the suffering of victims, particularly the vulnerable populations of poor countries. the commitments undertaken with regard to developing countries in terms of financial resources, technology transfer and capacity-building must be fulfilled, so that the appropriate measures can be undertaken to adapt to climate change and to mitigate its effects in those countries. in that connection, my delegation hopes that the climate conference to be held at the end of the year in cancun, mexico, will lead to an ambitious agreement that will commit states to concrete action. as it is fully aware of the pressing need to act, the guinean government, for its part, is determined to assume its share of the responsibility, especially since 25 10-55396 guinea plays a leading role in implementing all policies and strategies aimed at achieving sustainable development and restoring ecological balance in western african. as the source of over 20 rivers that irrigate the west african region, including the niger, senegal, gambia and makona rivers, guinea is a veritable water tower for western africa and the crucible for an incredibly rich biodiversity. the main theme of this session, reaffirming the central role of the united nations in global governance, is extremely timely. we acknowledge that most gratefully. in a highly interdependent world that is marked by the combined effects of many crises, a new culture of international solidarity is essential. likewise, a profound reform of our organization is needed to make it more democratic, more representative and transparent. sixty-five years after its creation, the united nations does indeed need to be reformed in order to become more effective and better placed to meet the aspirations of our peoples. let us make it an effective instrument in the service of peace, security, development and human rights. only in that way will current and future generations in all countries and all regions of the world see their hopes of living in peace realized in a world that is free and prosperous, without fear, poverty or need.",Guinea,Africa,25.3077392578125,2.55118989944458,1766.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,2.2650056625141564
MLI,66,2011,"allow me at the outset to convey the regrets of his excellency mr. amadou toumani toure, president of the republic of mali, who, owing to a particularly busy national schedule at this time, was unable to attend the current session of the general assembly. however, he asked me to convey his most cordial greetings and sincere wishes for the success of our work. the mali delegation is particularly pleased to convey to mr. al-nasser its heartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of the general assembly at its sixty-sixth session. his election is not only a just recognition of his exceptional qualities as a seasoned diplomat, but also a tremendous tribute to his country, qatar, with which mali enjoys excellent relations. i therefore assure him of the support and full cooperation of my delegation in discharging his mission. allow me also to express my great appreciation to his predecessor, mr. joseph deiss, for the superb manner in which he presided over the sixty- fifth session, which has just ended, to the satisfaction of all member states. finally, i should like to congratulate secretary- general ban ki-moon on his outstanding re-election as the head of the organization. i remain fully convinced that his unswerving commitment to upholding the principles and ideals of the organization and to the achievement of the millennium development goals will help to strengthen further the role of the united nations on the international scene. the current global context is marked by profound political upheavals that gravely threaten international peace and security. this situation makes the theme chosen for the general debate the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes all the more pertinent. i should therefore like first to stress the important role of mediation and the urgency of renewed collective efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts and, above all, to put a halt to violence, the untold suffering inflicted on civilian populations, and the massive destruction of socio-economic infrastructure. 5 11-51197 my country remains convinced that the prevention of conflicts and their resolution through mediation are undoubtedly guarantees of peace and lasting security. in that regard, mali will continue to encourage and support all initiatives and mediation efforts under way with a view to combating the root causes of conflicts and paving the way to a lasting political solution able to guarantee peace, stability and security, without which there can be no socio-economic development. part of this process are the promotion of good-neighbourly relations and peaceful coexistence, the non-use of force in dispute settlement, understanding and mutual respect, the bolstering of international cooperation, and the culture of peace and dialogue among religions and civilizations. the events under way in the world are of concern to us in that they clearly demonstrate that the quest for peace and security remains the most pressing challenge. in africa, while outstanding progress has been made in promoting peace, security and stability, the fact remains that the situation in the horn of africa and in north africa, particularly in libya, remains a source of major concern. today more than ever, weapons and deadly confrontations must give way to the imperative of dialogue and national reconciliation, which are required to establish lasting peace, consolidate national unity and maintain territorial integrity. in the middle east, the palestinian question is and remains a source of major concern to the international community, which must encourage the israelis and palestinians to take the steps necessary to establish a climate of trust and launch direct negotiations towards a comprehensive peace underpinned, inter alia, on the relevant resolutions of the general assembly and the security council. while reiterating its active solidarity and total support to the palestinian people in their just, legitimate struggle, mali will continue to support all initiatives towards the creation of an independent, sovereign and viable palestinian state living side by side and in peace with israel within secure, internationally recognized borders. international peace and security continue to be threatened by other phenomena, such as international terrorism, cross-border organized crime, and the traffic in weapons, drugs and human beings. the attacks perpetrated throughout the world are stark reminders that no country is safe from terrorism, and that no cause, howsoever just, can justify the deliberate use of violence against innocent civilians. in that regard, i note the security challenges in the vast sahelo-saharan strip that mali shares with several brother countries in the region. our subregion faces today the proliferation of small arms and light weapons and the trafficking of drugs and human beings fuelled by organized crime networks in collusion with terrorist groups. the events in libya and their collateral effects could further aggravate this already worrisome situation. aware of the threats posed by these phenomena to the stability and harmonious development of the region, the governments of the countries concerned have worked to establish joint operational mechanisms to combat our common enemies effectively. for its part, the government of mali reaffirms its full support for all initiatives of the states of the subregion seeking to better coordinate and harmonize our efforts to meet the multiple common challenges. parallel to efforts at the subregional level, our government is intensifying its efforts to implement the special programme for peace, security and development in northern mali. the year 2012 will be an important one for mali. after almost 20 years of democratic institutional practices, the president of the republic, who will not stand for re-election, saw fit to revise the 1992 constitution, following broad national consultations, in order to consolidate democracy, good governance and the rule of law in our country. a participative, inclusive process has already been opened with all stakeholders the government, political parties, national deputies and civil society to guarantee the transparency and credibility of future referendums and future. i reiterate the commitment of the government to do its utmost to smoothly implement the envisaged reforms and meet the challenge of holding successful elections in 2012. i remain confident of success as our democracy has matured over the past four elections. this progress has been inspired from malian culture based on dialogue, tolerance and sharing. the people of mali share the ambition of the government to build a strong, united mali a democratic and stable mali resolutely committed to peace, dialogue and international cooperation. they also share the determination of the government to create the conditions for true prosperity in order to 11-51197 6 make mali an emerging economy in the medium term. that is why i solemnly call from this rostrum on the international community and development partners to support the electoral process under way and our efforts to meet the challenge of organizing a constitutional referendum and free, transparent and democratic elections. as a sahelo-saharan country facing the phenomenon of desertification and unpredictable rainfall, mali considers climate change to be one of the major challenges affecting the survival and development of humankind. that is why we are present at all meetings on this issue, as borne out by our recent participation at the high-level meeting on the theme addressing desertification, land degradation and drought in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication. i reaffirm malis commitment to continuing to step up its actions to preserve and conserve the soils, forests and fauna, in step with the national and international commitments of our country. the sessions of the general assembly also offer us a chance to take stock of the severity of other challenges facing the world. i think in particular of the struggle against hiv/aids, tuberculosis, malaria and non-communicable diseases, which were the subject of high-level meetings on 19 and 20 september. in addition to the challenges they pose to public health, these scourges have become a real problem for development. the international community must, we believe, redouble its efforts and its vigilance to contain these illnesses. it will also have to deliver on its commitments to the developing countries in order to allow them to achieve the millennium development goals. it is also important to give sustained attention to the issue of reform and democratization of the united nations by giving a greater role to women in decision- making in political, economic and security forums. it is also important to democratize the international financial institutions, bearing in mind the huge changes that have taken place in the world and the need for better representation for all regions. the global economic situation certainly remains fragile, but the financial crisis should not become a pretext for reducing official development assistance (oda). the implementation of the programme of action for the achievement of the millennium development goals must remain a priority. the international community must revive its collective will to put into practice and even go beyond commitments undertaken in the field of oda in order to combat poverty and all forms of injustice that breed violence and insecurity throughout the world. similarly, the implementation of the istanbul political declaration and programme of action for the least developed countries (ldcs) for the decade 2011- 2020 will allow the ldcs to marshal the necessary financial resources to ensure the lasting growth and development that guarantee peace and stability in the world. in that regard, mali will continue to support all innovative initiatives in development financing, trade, the alleviation of foreign debt, and technology transfer to developing countries in general and ldcs in particular. in our quest for a safer and more just, prosperous and peaceful world, the best way to guarantee our common future is to strengthen cooperation and international solidarity. let us engage collectively to find lasting solutions to the challenges and complex problems facing humankind. it is in the interest of us all and in the interest of our collective survival.",Mali,Africa,30.6186695098877,3.75423002243042,1613.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
MUS,66,2011,"the primary purpose of the united nations is to maintain peace and security, as set out in the very first article of its charter. this remains the top priority of the international community and of the united nations. however, 66 years after the adoption of the charter, our definition of peace and security differs from what it was in the immediate aftermath of the second world war. our concerns today are wider than the mere suppression of aggression or similar breaches of peace. we are now equally concerned about the threats to peace and security resulting from factors other than armed aggression. tensions exist, within nations and among nations, as a result of unequal access to resources, the lack of food security, or existential threats because of the inability to address climate change issues. insecurity also results from the absence of an adequate international mechanism for the redress of grievances and the peaceful settlement of disputes. i propose to deal with four of the constitutive elements of present-day security that the international community and the united nations should address, 11-51360 24 namely, the elements of economic, environmental, human and legal security. when peoples and nations feel inextricably mired in poverty and face bleak prospects for development, they are insecure about their future. that economic insecurity may ultimately threaten global peace. the current economic turmoil is deepening the despair of those who live in need and is spreading despondency, even in relatively affluent countries. the world economy has yet to recover from the crisis of 2008. today, europe and north america struggle with budget deficits, unsustainable debts and high unemployment. at the same time, the recent political turmoil across the middle east could mean that oil and food prices will continue to rise. as developed economies grapple with these serious challenges, the developing world finds itself negatively impacted by economic and financial crises resulting from failures in which it had absolutely no part. while the ability of established developed countries to deal with economic and financial problems is in question, the world is witnessing the rapid rise of a number of emerging economies. as the economic centre of gravity shifts eastward and creates new opportunities, we must ensure that those formidable global challenges do not create economic insecurity for those who feel left behind and that they do not lead to other threats to international security. it is imperative that we manage these transformations judiciously and with pragmatism. in that context, i must stress the particular economic vulnerabilities of small island developing states (sids). the economies of sids remain highly volatile because of their open economies, small economic size, narrow resource base, disadvantages in economies of scale, high export concentration, dependency on imports and high vulnerability to energy- and food- price shocks. we reiterate that sids need to be granted preferential treatment as part of a global strategy to ensure economic security. regrettably, sids have been denied the formal recognition of their specific vulnerabilities that would entitle them to special consideration. my delegation fully supports the implementation of the barbados plan of action and the mauritius strategy for the further implementation of the programme of action for the sustainable development of small island developing states. as there are increasing concerns over issues such as employment, food security, climate change and access to water, it is a matter of regret that trade talks that could give a boost to international trade, and therefore to economic security, are stalled. on a broader note, i must say that talks on trade and other economic issues, to the extent that they take place at all, are held in sectoral and often restricted forums. while the specialized nature of these negotiations, or of the scope of the matters being addressed by standard-setting organizations, may require dedicated sectoral frameworks, it is imperative that the international community ensures that those frameworks are legitimate ones, with universal membership. it is also imperative that, as an apex body, the united nations have a holistic view on global economic, financial, trade and development issues. during the 1970s, the united nations played a significant role in shaping the conceptual framework for a new international economic order. the united nations has adopted a number of landmark resolutions that have laid the normative foundation for a more equitable economic order. the united nations still has a role to play in shaping the world economic order to ensure economic security, in accordance with its mandate under the charter. the united nations is the only international organization with not just the necessary legitimacy and universality but also the responsibility to have an overview of global economic development. in doing so, the united nations will ensure policy coordination among forums for various sectors, set principles and guidelines for sector-specific negotiations, and assume its ultimate responsibility for the economic security of all nations. to reaffirm its responsibility with respect to economic security, the united nations must not only undergo reforms in its institutions and working methods, it must also re-balance its focus on political and economic issues. in this regard, the economic and social council must be given the prominence it was intended to have as one of the principal organs of the united nations. and in assuming its responsibility with respect to economic security, a reformed and revitalized united nations will have to work more closely with regional cooperative institutions, which are the pillars of international cooperation. the high food prices of 2007 and 2008 and the global economic crisis led millions of people into food 25 11-51360 insecurity and raised the total number of people who go hungry to more than 1 billion. commodity prices remain high and the risk of repeated crises is real. with the projected increase in world population to 9.1 billion by 2050, and the rising costs of production, there is a risk of persistent price volatility. that will be exacerbated by the effects of climate change. the international community must therefore seriously address the issue of food insecurity around the world. economic security also entails working towards a more inclusive national society without discrimination, eliminating inequalities and fostering wider participation on the part of all sections of the community in national development and governance. two days ago, at our 14th meeting, we gathered to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the durban declaration and programme of action. we welcome the progress achieved in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance since 2001. we nonetheless recognize that in spite of these efforts, many people continue to be victims of these despicable practices. we commend the united nations on the success of the high-level meeting of the general assembly on youth (see a/65/pvs.111 and 112) and the adoption of the outcome document (resolution 65/312). development and security will require greater participation by young people in the formulation of strategies and policies. in that same spirit, we welcome the establishment of un-women and its overarching vision of a world in which societies are free of gender-based discrimination and where women and men have equal opportunities, respect and consideration. a more inclusive world, where womens intellectual and economic potential is fully realized, will promote economic security. in june of next year, world leaders will meet in rio de janeiro to renew their political commitment to sustainable development and, hopefully, to adopt concrete measures that will contribute to greater economic security. but before we can move ahead, we will also have to consider why so many past commitments have not been honoured. we look forward to the oceans receiving the attention that they deserve at rio, as part of the broader economic agenda. small island states in particular are relying on the international community to give due attention to the sustainability of the oceans in the context of the united nations conference on sustainable development (rio+20) and beyond. the sustainability of oceans is crucial to the security and, in some cases, the very survival of many small island states. humanity as a whole is now increasingly concerned about its environmental security, probably more than it has ever been in its history. for some small island nations, this concern is, in fact, an existential one. in recent decades the united nations has brought to the fore the concept of sustainable development and the measures required to promote such development. the preparatory work under way for rio+20 has highlighted the serious gaps we still face in this area. the disruptions resulting from climate change pose a real threat to global security. climate change is real. extreme weather phenomena such as super-storms, floods, droughts and heat-waves are already upon us. climate change is affecting us in our daily life, and it threatens the very survival of many small islands. mauritius is already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change. air temperature has risen by 0.6 to 1.1c in different microclimates over recent decades. the sea level is rising at the rate of 1.2 millimetres per year in the south-west indian ocean. our annual rainfall has decreased by 8 per cent compared to the 1950s. extreme weather conditions such as flooding are becoming more frequent. without international cooperation and concerted action, the impact of climate change will be devastating for all our nations. my delegation firmly believes that the united nations framework convention on climate change is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change. small island nations are economically vulnerable, and their vulnerability is exacerbated by the dramatic consequences of climate change. small island states rely on the international community for their security. mauritius is committed to the concept of the green economy. we recognize that it is not a one-size- fits-all notion. countries need to reflect their own national priorities and realities in their implementation of it. my government has been pursuing a sustainable development strategy. the maurice ile durable project, which we adopted in 2008, is taking shape, and a whole range of measures have already been 11-51360 26 implemented. we propose to increase the share of renewable energy in the generation of power from the present 18 per cent to 35 per cent by 2025, by making more intensive use of biofuels and wave, solar and wind energy. to that end in may last year i set up a full-fledged ministry with responsibility for sustainable development. we are engaged in a national consultation process to formulate strategies and policies that have public support and are designed to protect the environment, deliver social justice and create a sustainable economy. climate has impacted the water cycle both directly and indirectly, and will continue to do so, by affecting precipitation and evaporation cycles as well as water availability and patterns of water consumption. many regions of the world are already experiencing reduced rainfall. as climate change intensifies and water scarcity becomes more acute, the threat of tensions among different nations and different users may increase. the international community must therefore work together to address this pressing issue. environmental security must be a priority of the united nations in promoting global security. as well as dealing with the existential threat that climate change poses for some nations, people around the world continue to be concerned about their own security. i will mention four such concerns. disarmament is a major component of international security strategy. the threat to humanity posed by the continued existence of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction is a universal concern. our failure to resolve the issue of disarmament continues to undermine global development and security. a significant reduction in the production of conventional weapons and eventually a world free of nuclear weapons are goals that will be achieved only over time, and that will require patience and perseverance. as a matter of fact, the international political environment is now probably more conducive to the realization of these goals than it has ever been. terrorism continues to be a threat to security. recent events have reminded us that acts of terrorism can be perpetrated by extremists from all points on the political spectrum, and that terrorism is equally capable of breeding in both poor and rich countries. the international community needs to follow up on the united nations global counter-terrorism strategy and enhance international cooperation in that regard. the world drug report 2011 again shows that drug trafficking and consumption remain significant. narco-trafficking and drug money in organized crime and terrorist activities are a threat to stability and security at the national and regional levels. as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the 1961 single convention on narcotic drugs, let us recommit our efforts to fight drug trafficking as part of the global strategy to ensure human security. we are 30 years into the fight against hiv/aids, which is an ever-present threat to human security. i am convinced that we have achieved more in the 10 years since the special session of the general assembly on hiv/aids than we did in the previous two decades. it is heartening that the high-level meeting on hiv/aids held in june renewed the political commitment of governments to halting and reversing the spread of hiv/aids and to ensuring that, by 2015, no child is born with hiv (see resolution 65/277, annex). mauritius fully adheres to the unaids vision of uniting for universal access. the national aids secretariat, which i set up in may 2007, pursues its work to achieve zero new infections, zero discrimination and zero aids-related deaths in mauritius. article 2 of the united nations charter provides that all members shall settle their disputes by peaceful means. article 33 spells out the means and ways of doing so. in the same spirit, the charter provides in chapter xiv for the establishment of the international court of justice. however, recourse to international adjudication for the peaceful settlement of disputes between states has, historically, required the consent of the states concerned. in recent times, a number of bilateral or multilateral agreements have provided for the prior commitment of states to submit to arbitration or adjudication. we welcome that development. security requires the appropriate legal framework for the redress of grievances or the settlement of disputes. the international community has yet to set up adequate machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes that is available to all states. the general assembly has decided to convene a high-level meeting during the sixty-seventh session on the rule of law. we welcome that decision, but we want 27 11-51360 to stress that the debate on the rule of law must apply at both the national and international level. we would therefore look forward to the assembly discussing the rule of law as it applies to inter-state relations as part of the forthcoming debates. allow me to give as an example the difficulties that my own country has experienced in resolving a dispute with the former colonial power, the united kingdom, relating to decolonization. the chagos archipelago, which is part of mauritian territory, was excised from mauritius prior to independence, in total disregard of resolutions 1514 (xv) and 2066 (xx) and the principles of international law, and was declared the so-called british indian ocean territory. the united kingdom has failed to engage in any meaningful discussions with us on the matter. when the government of mauritius consequently announced in 2004 that it would refer the dispute to the international court of justice, the united kingdom immediately amended its declaration, under article 36 of the courts statute, to reject the jurisdiction of the court with respect to certain disputes with a member or former member of the commonwealth. that illustrates the kind of difficulties that a state may face in settling a claim under international law. the states involved in the dispute may refuse to negotiate in good faith and seek to ensure that no international tribunal can determine the law applicable to the dispute. we call on the united nations to keep under review the whole issue of the settlement of disputes, including by judicial means, and to set standards of conduct for all states with respect to negotiation, conciliation, mediation or other forms of non-judicial and peaceful settlement of disputes or, alternatively, to the submission of the dispute to adjudication. in that context, mauritius is particularly pleased to welcome the decision of the president of the general assembly to adopt as the theme of its current session the role of mediation in settling international disputes. we affirm our full support in advancing that cause. greater legal security also requires better global governance. in that respect, the united nations must lead by example. the united nations must recognize that the world has changed since 1945. current efforts to adopt reforms in relation to the security council, the revitalization of the general assembly and the working methods of our organization must be given the sincere and strong support that is required. my delegation continues to believe that comprehensive reform of the security council should include reform in the membership of both the permanent and the non-permanent categories. africa should no longer be deprived of its right to permanent representation on the council. my delegation fully supports the african common position enshrined in the ezulwini consensus and the sirte declaration. we equally believe that latin america also fully deserves permanent representation on the council. mauritius further reiterates its support for indias rightful aspiration to a permanent seat in a reformed security council. we also look forward to a more all-inclusive united nations system that can effectively address issues of international security, with the admission of palestine as a member state. the united nations and the international community have a duty to restore to the palestinian people their dignity and their right to statehood and security. mauritius supports the application for full membership of the united nations, submitted to the secretary-general yesterday by the president of the state of palestine (a/66/371, annex), and the legitimate aspiration of the palestinian people to take their rightful place in the international community. we welcome the statement by president abbas at the 19th meeting that palestine extends its hands to the israeli government and the israeli people for peacemaking and for building cooperative relations between the states of palestine and israel. we are also pleased to welcome the emergence of south sudan as an independent and a sovereign state and its admission to the united nations. before i conclude, i wish to say a few words about matters of interest to our region. as a coastal state of the indian ocean, mauritius is concerned by piracy, which poses a threat to global commerce. it hinders economic development and has become a major security issue in the region and beyond. we welcome the response of the international community to that serious threat. cognizant of the problems that arise in connection with the prosecution and detention of pirates, mauritius has offered to assist with the prosecution and detention of pirates. mauritius and the european union signed an agreement in july this year to enhance our capacity to contribute to the international effort under way in that regard. 11-51360 28 if the international response to the famine in somalia is not commensurate with the immense and immediate needs of the people, we fear that the problem of piracy will only worsen. the continued unlawful occupation of the chagos archipelago by the united kingdom is a matter of concern for the region. mauritius welcomes the support of the african union and of the non-aligned movement for the territorial integrity of our country. the purported declaration of a marine protected area around the chagos archipelago by the united kingdom, in breach of the united nations convention on the law of the sea, is another cause for concern. that is why, in december of last year, mauritius commenced arbitration proceedings against the united kingdom under the 1982 convention on the law of the sea. as regards tromelin, mauritius and france made progress with an agreement on joint management, without prejudice to our sovereignty. however, we need to continue our dialogue for at the end of the day, the territorial integrity of mauritius will not be complete without the return of tromelin. as a member of the southern african development community (sadc) and current chair of the indian ocean commission, mauritius welcomes the signing last week of an agreement between leading stakeholders on a road map for the restoration of democracy in our neighbouring state of madagascar. that agreement was reached following the relentless efforts of sadc and the indian ocean commission to bring the parties together. implementation of the road map requires the holding of national and local elections, for which significant resources need to be mobilized. we call on the united nations and the international community to extend all their support for the successful implementation of the road map. (spoke in french) the lack of security on the economic, environmental, legal or even, in some cases, existential fronts calls for a review of the mandated obligations of the united nations. while the initial concerns of the founding fathers about threats to international security remain valid, the international community today is just as concerned by other threats to its security and other challenges to be tackled. i would add that, in updating this concept of security and, by extension, in redefining the role of the united nations, the international community must also foster dialogue among cultures and civilizations. we welcome the secretary-generals initiative to create the alliance of civilizations, whose mission is to improve understanding and relations among nations and peoples of different cultures and religions and to assist efforts to halt the forces that fuel divisions and extremism. tensions are often caused by ignorance, by fear of others and by feelings of justice denied. thus it is crucial not only to maintain dialogue among nations and peoples, but also to promote the understanding of cultures and civilizations.",Mauritius,Africa,89.2498397827148,3.332070112228394,3639.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.0992030777686177
TGO,66,2011,"my country, togo, welcomes the election of the president of the assembly to direct the work of the general assembly at its sixty-sixth session. on behalf of the government and people of togo and on my own behalf, i would like to convey our warm congratulations to him. we wish him every success in accomplishing his noble and exhilarating mission. today more than ever, the ever increasing number of challenges facing the planet call for greater solidarity to provide an effective global solution worthy of our peoples aspirations. when world leaders bringing forth their nations ambitions meet in this forum to reflect upon the main issues of the hour, it is to give their people hope for a brighter tomorrow. 23 11-51372 in order to address those various challenges, togo has for several years endeavoured to relaunch its economy to achieve sustainable development for the well-being of its people. we have made strengthening national unity and good governance, reviving economic growth and combating social injustice our rallying cry. in terms of political governance, togo remains faithful to its new vision of sharing its victory with all stakeholders of goodwill, including political parties that have lost in elections. above all, this is about emphasizing the peoples victory and not that of any political party. in our opinion, that concept of power should inspire all leaders who seek greater stability following elections. based on its desire to strengthen the gains made in the area of democratization, the government of togo supports the implementation of the recommendations made by the european union election observation mission, including institutional and constitutional reforms, especially against the backdrop of the local and legislative elections to be held in 2012. in that respect, faithful to the policy of openness and cooperation initiated by our head of state, the government has renewed its dialogue with all political and civic stakeholders under its permanent framework for dialogue and cooperation in order to pursue discussions on all subjects concerning the management of governmental affairs. the truth, justice and reconciliation commission, launched two years ago with the task of promoting national reconciliation, is currently at the critical stage of holding both public and closed hearings, according to witness preference. that is an opportunity for all togolese men and women to talk to each other about the most painful moments of their history and to speak truthfully in order to ensure justice and reconciliation, thereby making it possible to turn the page once and for all. in terms of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the government of togo has made commitments to increasing state capacities to protect individuals and property and guarantee fundamental freedoms in order to prevent togos young democracy from losing ground with regard to the progress made in shaping its identity, as well as to avert any exploitation of differences. in that regard, togo has just provided the governing body of the human rights council in geneva with its national report in connection with the universal periodic review that will take place in a few weeks. togo would like to reaffirm its determination to honour its international commitments. we will continue to combat all types of human rights violations and to take action against their perpetrators. my country will therefore tirelessly continue the work already begun in order to strengthen the gains of democracy and peace, while making greater efforts to implement the millennium development goals. in terms of economic governance, togo is pursuing reforms for better management of its public finances, in order to optimize domestic revenues. we are working for a more robust financial sector, privatizing public banks, operationalizing the court of auditors and instituting a new public tendering code that is fully aligned with international standards. all that is in addition to the steps we have taken towards membership in the extractive industries transparency initiative. among other things, those various measures have allowed us to successfully conclude our participation in the heavily indebted poor countries debt initiative and to benefit from about $1.8 billion in debt cancellation. the broad ongoing programme to improve and rehabilitate road infrastructure throughout our national territory is an illustration of the effective implementation of this reform. on behalf of the government and the people of togo, i would like to thank all our partners that have assisted in our process to improve governance. this meeting is taking place at a time when africa is again threatened by famine such as we have not witnessed in 20 years. all countries, as well as the united nations, must take urgent measures to confront that exceptional situation if we wish to avoid a large- scale humanitarian tragedy. with respect to resolving conflict and promoting peace and security throughout the world, which is the theme of this session, it is encouraging to note that significant progress has been made. that is particularly in the case in africa, where peace and security have been restored in cote divoire, thereby enabling the relaunching of socio-economic activities in that country. the peaceful resolution of the lengthy conflict in south sudan, which has become the organizations 193rd member state, gives us reason to hope that any conflict can be resolved acceptably and sustainably so 11-51372 24 long as the parties concerned work in good faith to achieve that goal. also as we meet here, parts of the world continue to face waves of demonstrations and uprisings, especially in africa. those legitimate movements contribute to the blossoming of democracy for the people concerned. in addition to delivering on their legitimate expectations, they also help to avoid any risk of wavering in the medium term that might jeopardize peace and national unity. that seems to be true for all conflicts, because we believe that no sustainable solution is possible outside of negotiation. with regard to the middle east, my country therefore firmly believes that the parties to the israeli- palestinian conflict and the international community must continue to seek a political solution to that old conflict. the middle east must know peace. israel and palestine must coexist in two states with well-defined borders, in peace and security. we are fundamentally convinced that the aspirations of the palestinian people for a national state and those of israel for sustainable peace and security are not contradictory, but complementary, objectives. despite the many efforts and determination of the united nations to eradicate terrorism in all its forms, that scourge is gaining even more ground and is compromising the chances for building a world of peace and security. this year, as we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the tragic attacks on 11 september 2001, the international community and all states must continue to work synergistically so that humankind will not again experience such indiscriminate and wanton attacks as those of 9/11 or those that recently victimized the peaceful people of norway and the headquarters of the united nations in abuja. those crises and conflicts, as well as new threats to international peace and security, such as maritime piracy, cyber crime and drug trafficking, which undermine efforts to build peace throughout the world, require the international community to rethink the role of the united nations in the context of security and socio-economic development. at a time when the west african subregion is witnessing an increase in violence due to drug trafficking and terrorism in the area, we cannot allow our shorelines to be taken hostage by pirates, as was recently the case in the waters off benin and togo. i call for stricter cooperation among all countries to effectively combat this new phenomenon. as i just said we need to rethink the role of the united nations. while it is widely acknowledged that nothing can replace the organization, it is just as true that, 65 years after it was established, the united nations needs to be reformed. my country therefore calls on member states to pursue and conclude the process of security council reform, which began more than 15 years ago. like the majority of member states, togo hopes that this general assembly session will provide us an opportunity to take decisive steps with regard to council reform. in so doing, we have the opportunity to correct flagrant and unacceptable injustices and to make the security council truly representative of all the regions of the world, thereby making it better placed to resolve the crises and conflicts that we face. with regard to the process of replacing non-permanent members of the council, the assembly will elect five new members in october to replace those whose terms will end on 31 december. togo is among the candidates from the group of african states that are seeking the votes of member states in those elections. contrary to the practice observed today in africa with respect to elections to the security council, three candidates are in the running this year for the two seats that go to africa. togo, whose candidacy enjoys the endorsement of the economic community of western african states and the african union, of course attaches great importance to the sovereign right of each state to apply for a seat on any united nations body. however, i would like to ask all delegations to bear in mind the need to see emerge, after the elections, a security council that is balanced and representative of all the major regions in africa, especially west africa. my country has participated in united nations peacekeeping operations for many years. we are currently involved in the missions in cote divoire and the sudan, and will soon participate in the one in south sudan. we wish to sit on the council in order to make a contribution, however modest, to the work of the organ responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security. if elected, togo will focus on the importance of preventive diplomacy in the peaceful settlement of conflicts and the link between peace and security, on the one hand, and social justice and development, on the other. we would also not neglect combating the 25 11-51372 scourges to which i referred earlier, as well as new threats to international peace and security. togos noble ambition can only come to pass if we have the support of delegations for our candidacy. it is my hope that all member states will wish to provide their invaluable support for our candidacy. i wish very much to thank them in advance for their support.",Togo,Africa,60.4099388122559,3.077500104904175,1730.0,6.0,0.0,6.0,3.468208092485549
ZAF,66,2011,"on behalf of the government and the people of south africa, i wish to extend our sincere congratulations to ambassador nassir abdulaziz al-nasser on his election as president of the general assembly. we wish him a successful tenure in the stewardship of this body and assure him of our delegations full support. we also congratulate his predecessor, mr. joseph deiss, for the diligent manner in which he guided the work of the assembly at its sixty-fifth session. i would further like to take this opportunity to congratulate mr. ban ki-moon on his re-appointment as secretary-general. it is also an honour for south africa to welcome the republic of south sudan to the community of nations as the 193rd state member of the united nations. this month, the united states and the world marked the tenth anniversary of the horrendous terrorist attacks of 11 september 2001, which affected the united states and 89 other countries. that horrific incident united the international community and strengthened its resolve to cooperate in the fight against terrorism. we pay our respects to the victims of the tragedy and their families. we reaffirm our commitment to working with other member states to eradicate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. the theme of this session the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means is timely and well chosen. the charter of the united nations mandates the organization to utilize mediation as one of the tools to prevent and resolve conflicts across the globe. the role of mediation as a tool for the settlement of disputes has renewed relevance today, given the number of conflicts in the world. we should defend the independence and impartiality of the united nations and promote the principles of its charter during conflicts and crises. the united nations should never take sides in any conflict but should always maintain its impartiality. the united nations must not allow itself to be used by any country, regardless of its history or size. all citizens of the world should feel confident and secure in the knowledge that the united nations is above all partisan interests and serves only those of the citizens of the globe. we are of the view that regional organizations play a crucial role in the resolution of conflicts and in regional mediation processes. the charter of the united nations itself provides for the role of regional organizations in cooperation with the united nations. this role of the regions must always be enforced and enhanced, and not undermined. in our continent, the african union (au) continues to play a significant role in mediation and the resolution of conflicts, trying at 23 11-50702 all times to produce african solutions to african problems, of course with the support of the world. this year, the world witnessed the so-called arab spring in north africa and the middle east. with regard to the situation in libya, the au played a crucial role in seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis, in line with its mandate of working for peace and stability in the continent. however, it is a matter of record now that the au efforts were never given a chance. military actions were preferred over peaceful means. nonetheless, the au continues to be seized with the libyan conflict, as it should be. south africa, through the au and the united nations, will work with the national transitional council, the representative of the libyan people, as it proceeds to form an inclusive transitional government that will take the libyan seat in the african union. during this period of working towards normalcy in libya, we call for a cessation of hostilities and an end to the nato aerial bombardment. we also call for the lifting of the no-fly zone, whose imposition was necessary for the protection of civilians. the proliferation of arms in libya is a major concern. the transitional government will need to be supported in addressing this security issue. it may pose a serious challenge affecting the entire subregion if it is not adequately attended to. we also urge the new libyan authorities to ensure the protection of migrant workers, especially those from sub-saharan african countries, who number approximately 2.5 million. immediate measures should be taken to put an end to the killing, arbitrary arrest and detention of migrant workers and black libyans. we will fully support the people of libya as they go through the transition towards a new, united and democratic libya that protects human rights, human dignity and freedom. south africa continues to support international efforts to assist the people of palestine and israel to find lasting peace. the decades-old struggle of the palestinian people for a sovereign state of their own has now reached a turning point. the palestinian authority, backed by the league of arab states, has stated its intention to seek united nations membership for the state of palestine. south africa fully supports this position. it is a decisive step towards achieving lasting peace, economic cooperation and prosperity for the millions of people in the middle east, and we urge that it be viewed favourably. we also support the ongoing struggle for self- determination of the people of western sahara. we urge the international community to support their quest for freedom, human rights and dignity. we reiterate our call for the lifting of the economic and financial embargo against the people of cuba in order to help them gain their economic freedom. all member states have a duty to safeguard the future and relevance of the united nations. recent international developments have made more urgent our efforts to intensify the reform agenda of the united nations, particularly the security council, as well as the bretton woods institutions. no reform can be complete without the substantive reform of the security council, whose membership must be consistent with the principle of equitable geographical representation. in this regard, we reiterate our call for africa to be represented in the category of permanent membership of the security council. south africa is preparing to welcome the international community and all stakeholders to the seventeenth session of the conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change and to the seventh meeting of the parties to the kyoto protocol, in november and december this year. the success of the conference is highly dependent on the willingness of all parties to reach an agreement. it does not depend on south africa alone. as leaders, we are accountable to the global citizenry, the ordinary people that suffer daily from the impacts of climate change. they hold high expectations of their leaders to be responsible and to find effective solutions to the threat that climate change poses to their livelihood, quality of life, dignity and, in many cases, their very survival. we dare not fail them. we are witnessing the catastrophic effects of famine in somalia and neighbouring countries. our response should not be left to the united nations alone; it requires united action from all of us. south africa has been humbled to contribute in a small way to the alleviation of human suffering. the people of somalia still need more support, and we urge the world to focus its attention more sharply on somalia and its neighbours in the horn of africa. 11-50702 24 it is commendable that the millennium development goals and their realization by 2015 continue to feature on the agenda of the general assembly. we now have four years to go before we reach the target date. it is clear that many of the goals will not be attained on time, particularly in sub-saharan africa. we call on the international community and the united nations to redouble efforts to assist countries that are lagging. at this session, we will be commemorating the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the durban declaration and programme of action the outcome document of the world conference against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, which was held in durban in 2001. racism and racial discrimination continue to pose a challenge to humankind and to negate the principles of the charter of the united nations. we should continue to work together to eradicate the scourge of racism. on 8 january 2012, the african national congress (anc), the oldest liberation movement in africa, will mark 100 years of existence since its establishment in 1912. the anc spearheaded the struggle against racial oppression, colonialism and apartheid in south africa. it inspired many in the african continent to fight for their freedom and independence from colonialism. the united nations declared apartheid a crime against humanity and in that way endorsed the struggle against racial oppression in our country. the centenary of the anc recognizes the immense contribution of the united nations and the international community in working to eradicate racism and racial discrimination in the world. we will, tomorrow, host a symposium on south africas contribution to the fight against racism and racial discrimination. working together, let us remain committed to multilateralism and cooperation in this session of the general assembly and beyond, and promote the realization of a more equitable and just world.",South Africa,Africa,93.1021423339844,5.288980007171631,1521.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.6574621959237344
NAM,66,2011,"i wish to congratulate the president and his country, qatar, on his election to the presidency of the assembly at this session. with his wisdom and experience, i am confident that he will successfully steer the proceedings of the assembly. i assure him of my delegations cooperation and support. i also congratulate his excellency mr. ban ki-moon on his reappointment as secretary-general. i commend the president for choosing the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means as the theme for this debate. the peaceful settlement of disputes, as provided for in chapter vi of the united nations charter, is an important principle that the international community should uphold in seeking solutions to conflicts throughout the world. our government recognizes the legitimacy of peaceful demands for democratic changes in sister countries such as tunisia and egypt. however, we believe that the demands for democratic change should be locally driven. they should not be used as a pretext to undermine the fundamental principle of sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of independent states. we are concerned that all efforts by the african union to find a peaceful negotiated solution in libya were ignored and undermined. never in the history of the united nations has the sanctity of the principle of non-intervention been so compromised as we have witnessed recently in libya. the military intervention by a foreign power reminds africa of the infamous berlin conference of 1884, when africa was carved up by imperial powers. in the aftermath of the recent political changes in some african countries, it is important to underscore the need to promote genuine national reconciliation and unity and to begin urgently to address the challenges of poverty and unemployment, especially among the youth of the world. respect for justice, fundamental human rights, the rule of law and good governance should be preconditions for lasting peace. following successful negotiations, the republic of south sudan attained its independence on 9 july 2011. this demonstrated the statesmanship and wisdom of the leaders of the sudan and the republic of south sudan, who chose the path of peace and mediation. we call on the two countries to resolve all outstanding issues through peaceful means. i wish his excellency president salva kiir mayardit success as he leads the people of south sudan in building a united and prosperous nation. namibia calls for the immediate implementation of the united nations settlement plan and relevant united nations resolutions calling for the holding of a free and fair referendum in western sahara. with regard to palestine, i reaffirm our full and unequivocal support for the legitimate struggle of the palestinian people to achieve their inalienable right to self-determination and national independence. namibia supports the admission of palestine to the united nations as a full member. the overwhelming majority of the member states of the assembly have for many years expressed serious concern over the continuing economic, commercial and financial embargo against the republic of cuba. namibia calls for the immediate and unconditional lifting of this embargo. namibia welcomes the recent signing of the road map by the malagasy political stakeholders with the facilitation of the southern african development community mediator. it paves the way for bringing an end to the political crisis and returning madagascar to constitutional order and democratic rule. the united nations and the international community should provide adequate financial support to that country and become actively engaged in the ongoing mediation efforts to ensure the full implementation of the road map. 11-51185 20 the people of somalia are faced with not only political uncertainty but also a severe drought and famine, which have resulted in a human catastrophe. namibia has joined the international community in contributing food supplies to the people of somalia as part of the international effort to address the crisis. the effects of climate change are real and are acutely felt in every part of the globe. for the past three consecutive years namibia has experienced devastating floods, which negatively impacted our development plans. i take this opportunity to once again thank members of the international community who responded to our emergency appeal for assistance. now more than ever before, all member states should work towards the successful conclusion of the seventeenth conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, which will take place in durban, south africa, later this year. this should set the tone for the united nations conference on sustainable development, rio+20, to be held in rio de janeiro next year. the reform of the united nations system, especially the security council, has been painfully slow. i underscore namibias firm conviction that a reformed security council should be democratic, representative and transparent in its working methods. that is consistent with the african common position. it is incumbent on all member states to work together to strengthen the organization in order to guarantee international peace and security and to advance sustainable economic and social development for a fairer and more just world for all.",Namibia,Africa,88.2746276855469,8.021379308181094,836.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.1961722488038278
SEN,66,2011,"senegal welcomes the election of mr. nassir abdulaziz al-nasser as president of the general assembly to lead its work at this sixty-sixth session. therefore, i address to him and his country my warm congratulations. he will have the support of the senegalese delegation throughout his mandate. i also extend to the presidents predecessor, mr. joseph deiss, our appreciation for all his efforts to revitalize and strengthen the general assembly so that it may play its role under the charter. in addition, i also reiterate to the secretary- general, mr. ban ki-moon, my warmest congratulations on everything he has done for the organization. i should like to touch on the theme of the session, the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes. the charter has a number of provisions for the prevention of conflicts and for conflict-resolution. this goal, which was set down in the charter 66 years ago by the founding fathers, remains, despite evident progress, a long way off. this challenge concerns us, just as it engages our collective and individual responsibility to save current and future generations from the scourge of war. 5 11-50847 while the spectre of a major conflict has faded since the end of the cold war, millions of men and women around the world continue to suffer the disastrous consequences of conflicts old and new. peace can be threatened in different ways. it can be threatened when, on the fertile ground of political antagonisms and social, economic and religious conflicts, confrontation gains the upper hand over tolerance, respect and acceptance of our differences. peace is also threatened when the legitimate aspirations of peoples to freedom and respect for human rights find in response only indifference and refusal of dialogue, if not systematic repression, as is the case in a number of countries. our theme, mediation, is addressed in the charter, but there are similar notions, such as good offices and negotiations. i would like to contribute something by defining mediation as a mechanism whereby a person, a state or an institution comes between two parties in real or potential conflict and seeks to bring their points of view closer together, with a view to bringing the parties to make concessions and reach a consensus. that can apply to internal conflicts as well as conflicts between states. i wish to refer to resolution 37/10, of 1982, approving the manila declaration on the peaceful settlement of international disputes, and the 1988 declaration on the prevention and removal of disputes and situations which may threaten international peace and security and on the role of the united nations in this field (resolution 43/51). to these may be added the agenda for peace (a/47/277), drafted after the first security council summit meeting, held in january 1992, establishing a doctrine of so-called tension-prevention through early warning and preventive diplomacy. the fact is that by no stretch of the imagination can our organization alone do everything. we must consider mediation efforts at other levels, such as the regional level. it is a pity that africa has forgotten an original mechanism often used following independence: meetings between heads of state at their border to directly address their differences. unfortunately, this good practice is falling out of fashion, with general international mechanisms being favoured. in the two categories of mediation within a country or between countries we have very rich experiences in west africa. i shall limit myself to only mentioning them, because some are fairly well known. for example, with regard to internal conflict, when i was head of an opposition party i personally intervened at the request of heads of state, who appreciated that i had chosen a democratic internal opposition instead of armed national liberation movements. i often succeeded in bringing together points of view and even in integrating opposition into various governments, which i did myself later by agreeing to enter the government of the person who had been my adversary in a number of elections. i can give the example of guinea-bissau, a matter resolved by a trio of heads of state, of whom i was one, which decided to travel to the country, which was in conflict with the army. order was successfully re-established. the countries concerned were nigeria, ghana and senegal. more recently there was the ivorian crisis, which ended happily thanks to the economic community of west african states (ecowas), supported by the united nations and france. i could add the normalization of the situation in niger and guinea-conakry through the mediation of ecowas, which succeeded despite difficulties in establishing an elected government. i can also cite the peaceful declaration of independence of the state of south sudan. i commend the representative of that brother country here at the united nations. there are of course other cases. the examples i have given were just to show that at the regional level many conflicts can be settled directly by states, sometimes with the assistance of an outside country, such as france, or with the assistance of the united nations. to conclude that list of countries, i want to say that just a few days ago, as there is a threat of trouble on the border between liberia and cote divoire, the president of ecowas convened a small group of neighbouring countries, and we were able, with the help of the united nations, to establish a mechanism to prevent the intervention of mercenaries in cote divoire who were seeking to enter liberia to destabilize the country during election time. 11-50847 6 sadly, despite those successes, there are other potential conflicts, such as that which is harming relations between eritrea and ethiopia, and the potential conflict in darfur. i turn to mediation used in conflicts between states. i shall take just one example: palestine and the state of israel. i commend all the efforts made over many years to bring the two parties closer together, which unfortunately have not yet succeeded. so this year we have an application by palestine to the general assembly for recognition as a member state of the united nations. there is no doubt about senegals support for the application; it is the consequence of what has been our policy for a long time, particularly as today senegal is chairman of the united nations committee on the exercise of the inalienable rights of the palestinian people. senegal supports an independent palestinian state within internationally recognized borders as well as the existence of the state of israel, each within its own borders. it will not be easy to achieve that, but the international community will do its very best. i take this opportunity to make a clarification, because, despite my proximity to the arab countries and to the palestinians, a few days ago a statement was made about my playing the role of mediator in the israel-palestine conflict. president netanyahus understanding was mistaken. i have never been a mediator in the palestine-israel conflict and have never sought to be a mediator. moreover, we need to do much more than to call one country or one person to mediate in such a complicated situation. all goodwill is needed for a solution. having been awarded the houphouet-boigny peace prize, i must honour that distinction, so wherever i can intervene to find solutions i do so, on my own responsibility. i intervened personally for the release of a young soldier, gilad shalit, a few years ago. unfortunately, that was not successful, but on the basis of a number of suggestions i took the initiative once again some days ago. that seems to have had a reaction, in the light of what president netanyahu said. he said that he did not want mediation by senegal, and that senegal was an ally of palestine. but he was wrong. i do not do mediation; i provide good offices; i take it on my own responsibility to help release one young man when i believe that that young man should be elsewhere other than a prison and when i think that i can convince the parties above all, the palestinian parties, the current government of palestine, hamas of the need to release that young man for humanitarian reasons. if i succeed, excellent; if i fail, it will not stop me from starting over again. i will do that regardless of the position of the two parties in other words, regardless of the position of israel and of the position of hamas. that is consistent with my philosophy of peace and the choice that i have made to contribute to extending cooperation where i can. i believe that fear and mistrust, which persist between israel and palestine, could be mitigated this is a simple suggestion that i make to our secretary- general by establishing a committee of three states chosen by the two parties. those states would hold discussions to discover what guarantees are demanded by each party to commit to the path of negotiation for the existence of two states, the state of israel and the state of palestine, because at present, i believe, there is no dialogue, indirect or direct. i believe that my suggestion could facilitate understanding of the positions on both sides and could help mitigate fears and concerns that are major psychological barriers to discussion and to any agreement. maybe i am wrong. maybe this will not end in anything, but it costs nothing to try. i say to the secretary-general: before you reply no, i want you to consider my proposal for 40 days. if after that time you think that it cannot help solve the problem, you can say so. but i beg you to try to understand the proposal. i am ready to go into further details, even in a document. i have established this position, which could ultimately be fine-tuned using other peoples contributions. as i come to the end of my address i want to touch on security council reform. the topic has kept returning in a cyclical fashion for 18 years, and we have made no progress, due to great confusion. the current security council system has certain advantages. a security council, an international order, must exist, but it must be improved. but in its current functioning the security council has a fundamental role, which is to ignore the african continent. even on recent issues, such as libya, africa has no permanent seat with a right of veto. 7 11-50847 i will not speak of general reform of the security council. i know that it will not happen overnight. but i also know that since its creation there has been a need to increase the number of seats, and there needs to be a better distribution. i call for the remedying of a historic injustice to africa. seventy per cent of the issues on the security council agenda are african questions, and africa is absent, even on the question of libya. libya is an african country. therefore, it would be good to have an african country with a permanent seat on the security council with a right to the veto. i am not talking about a non-permanent seat; it must be permanent. we have made progress, because when a few years ago i had discussions with members of the council the majority thought that the idea was reasonable, if it could be detached from more general demands. but each time we bring it up it is a case of one step forward, two steps back. but we should not be discouraged. i come to my last point: the environment and the agricultural crisis. these are also issues of peace, because the environment is linked to climate change affecting particularly the developing countries, and above all africa. a few years ago a french philosopher wrote a famous work, lafrique, terre qui meurt, in which he spoke of savannization and desertification, problems that my own country suffers from. in the sahel i find that those words are particularly well based. above all, coastal erosion is accelerating. from morocco to the gulf of guinea seawater is filtering through layers of the continental shelf deep into the continent 480 kilometres salinizating the water table, with the result that the population is suffering an increasing lack of drinking water. marine erosion does not just mean that the coast is being eroded by the sea. it is destroying land in the interior, and making populations emigrate towards areas where they can find potable water. it is historically one of the main mechanisms of desertification. sometimes whole populations are forced to go elsewhere. but we are not standing idly by. that is why we have created the great green wall, extending from dakar to djibouti, 7,000 kilometres long and 15 kilometres wide. that is why we called on the eu to finance a study with european and african experts to find a solution to the infiltration of marine waters into the continental shelf. we have built part of the atlantic wall in senegal, but only two kilometres, because one kilometre costs a great deal of money $2 million. in depth it is to go as far as the granite plateau, at which point it can go no further. we do not want to take it too far, because in environmental matters it is important before doing anything to find out what the consequences elsewhere will be. that is why we need to analyse the matter in an entirely scientific way, since the forces of the sea that are stopped have not been negated; they are diverted by the sand and liquids. the experts can clarify the situation and help us, with full knowledge of the facts, use our resources to end this degradation, which, sadly, is leading to the disappearance of a large part of our continent. the tsunami is not just the effect of huge waves on a coast. it is also destruction that happens within our continent. i wanted to mention that phenomenon to draw attention to the great dangers threatening africa. finally, we recently held the second international dakar agricultural forum to consider the rise in agriculture prices, from which even producing countries are suffering, like us, because we are also big consumers. the participants proposed the establishment of an organization for global agricultural governance. we urge that the headquarters of such an important institution be in africa, and not in a developed country. there is no major organization of its kind with its headquarters in africa. the organizations that are helping us need to be with us on the ground. the role of the proposed organization would be to regulate the prices of agricultural products and ensure a minimum income for small farmers. i commend our draft resolution on the matter. the policy of the organization could be to play a role in reducing productivity differentials. why is productivity higher in the united states and europe than in africa for example, in zimbabwe? we need to ask the question and find solutions. in senegal, we have addressed the issue with a plan that we call the grand agricultural offensive for food and abundance to deal with the productivity 11-50847 8 differentials between senegal and certain italian regions. it has allowed us to move from being, in 2007, dependent on others for food to the status of a country that has achieved food self-sufficiency. this year we may even be able to begin exporting, which is a remarkable achievement. i must say that we have been helped by chance, since fertilizer constitutes at least 30 per cent of costs, and our fertilizer can be used directly, without any preparation. moreover, friendly countries helped us acquire important equipment on very favourable conditions over a long term. the scope and complexity of the organizations tasks put in perspective its successes and its setbacks. but what determines our commitment to the institution, what gives hope to the peoples that we represent here, what definitively gives them trust and faith in the organization, is the feeling that when it deliberates, when it decides and when it acts, it observes without discrimination the principles enshrined in the charter: universality, legality, justice and impartiality. finally, the extent to which those values are safeguarded is the measure of the legitimacy and success of our organizations interventions.",Senegal,Africa,51.8145484924316,4.903029918670654,2704.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COM,67,2012,"allow me, at the outset, to extend my warmest congratulations to his excellency mr. vuk jeremic, minister for foreign affairs of serbia, on his election to the presidency of the general assembly. i should like to express to him the pleasure of the union of the comoros at seeing him preside over our work and to assure him of the full support of the comorian delegation in discharging his noble task.i should also like to pay tribute to his predecessor, mr. nassir abdulaziz al-nasser, former permanent representative of the state of qatar, who presided over the general assembly with such wisdom, skill and determination and who was successful in working to strengthen its role. finally, i wish to congratulate the secretary- general, his excellency mr. ban ki-moon, for the vision with which he has led the organization and for the worthy initiatives he has ceaselessly undertaken to promote respect for the purposes and principles of the charter of the united nations, especially peacebuilding and stability for greater development. as was the case last year, the general assembly is meeting in a context of global uncertainty. it is a climate marked by multifaceted crises, all of them major challenges for our institution. it is meeting at a moment when one of the members of our united nations family, syria, is being rent asunder by a steadily deterioraiting fratricidal war, which poses a serious threat to peace both for the region and for the world, due to that countrys strategic geopolitical position. the resignation of the joint special envoy of the united nations and the league of arab states, former united nations secretary-general kofi annan, demonstrated, were there any need for such, the complexity of managing the syrian conflict. it therefore behoves us to act without delay to put an end to the terrible suffering of the brotherly syrian people and to save what can be saved of its various infrastructures. just as important is the palestinian cause. for decades now, it has awaited a fair and lasting solution, one found through our shared desire to establish together the solid foundations for a world of peace and prosperity. the union of the comoros reiterates its full support for the palestinian people and associates itself with the formula of a palestinian state as a full-fledged member of the community of nations, living side by side and in perfect security with the state of israel. the situation in northern mali is also alarming. the attacks carried out against the civilian population of the region, the serious violations of human rights, the obstacles erected to humanitarian access, and the destruction and looting of holy places and other religious, historical and cultural sites are barbarous acts that are contrary to the principles of islam. that is why my country supports the commitment of the economic community of west african states, alongside the african union and the united nations, to put an end to those violations, which have gone on for much too long. one should not, however, lose sight of the fact that while some advocate fanaticism and extremism, islamophobia is also taking on alarming proportions. indeed, the dissemination of the video innocence of muslims has led to waves of indignation and many demonstrations throughout the world. several million believers have felt their faith insulted and harmed. however, the protests against the unspeakable insults to islam, muslims and the prophet muhammad peace be upon him cannot justify the violence against western missions in many countries. my country therefore condemns the terrorist attacks that in benghazi, libya, caused the death of the american ambassador, chris stevens, and a number of his colleagues. i take this opportunity to reiterate to the american people and to the grieving families of the victims the most heartfelt condolences of the people and the government of the comoros. the ongoing existence of many hotbeds of tension throughout the world, the violation of fundamental human rights, and the growth of piracy and terrorism all speak to the need for urgent and in-depth reform of the security council. my country therefore reiterates its support for the african unions position regarding the need to reform the council for better representation of the international community and for greater effectiveness in the settlement and management of conflicts. a few decades ago, my country resolutely committed itself to the path of democracy. it wishes to make its contribution to the promotion of a world of peace, security, justice and fairness. that is why i have committed myself, since my accession to the presidency, to spare no effort in promoting the rule of law and good governance in the union of the comoros. above and beyond the setting up of all institutions provided for under our constitution, including the supreme court, i have given major priority to the fight against corruption. an anti-corruption law has already been promulgated, and a national commission to combat and prevent corruption has now been set up and made operational. i thank the european union for its assistance and expertise in this area, which enabled us to develop the document for our national strategy to combat corruption.this year once again, the global economic and financial crisis is at the heart of the assemblys general debate. that crisis has made evident the urgent need for a global form of economic governance based on the values of responsibility, fairness and solidarity. it has also placed before the eyes of the world the urgency of an in-depth reform of the international financial institutions. the repercussions of the crisis are becoming increasingly palpable, particularly in developing countries, where the rising price of staples threatens peace and stability. the crisis has also intensified problems linked to energy, which powers all socioeconomic development, limiting our ability to promote development through investments. climate change is another major challenge our countries face. we must respond effectively to that phenomenon, which affects the entire planet, especially small island developing states such as the union of the comoros. i wish to stress that last april my country experienced two weeks of unusually violent torrential rains that hammered our islands, causing damage that had disastrous consequences for our population and the national economy. ten per cent of the population was affected, a high percentage for a country as sparsely populated as the comoros. in the name of the whole comorian people and of my government, i would therefore like to thank all the partners and friends who offered us urgent humanitarian aid to help us address that dramatic situation. the unprecedented storms led my government to draw up a rapid recovery plan, with the aid and support of the international community. it will enable us to better help those affected and to restore destroyed infrastructure throughout our territory. that plan, which contains procedures aimed at restoring the situation within a period of six to 12 months, was launched at a round table held on 5 september in pretoria, with the fraternal support of our friendly brother country, the republic of south africa. i would therefore like to appeal to all here to help finance the rapid recovery plan, whose cost has been estimated at $18 million. that will allow my country to better face the current situation and to better prepare for the future. the time has come to relaunch with greater determination a number of pending international issues, in particular those regarding measures to mitigate or adapt to climate change and to make operational the copenhagen climate fund. we need to honour the commitments made to the countries of the south by implementing, inter alia, the agreements on emissions linked to deforestation and forest degradation, as well as a comprehensive agreement on climate change. we must also respect the kyoto protocol on the reduction of greenhouses gases within the framework of the united nations framework convention on climate change. finally, we must do our utmost to achieve the millennium development goals. faced with all those equally important challenges, i urgently call on the most developed countries to apply to the most fragile countries the same mechanisms that have been implemented to reduce the impact of the crisis in europe, in order to prevent more unfortunate consequences, knowing that our countries depend on the financial contributions of our people abroad. in that context, my country, which is currently a beneficiary of the extended credit facility of the international monetary fund, hopes by december to have reached the completion point of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative. in other words, the new world economic order, based on the shared principles of fairness, transparency and prosperity that we have willingly embraced, requires a real and dynamic easing of the crisis that has struck the world. africa impatiently awaits the advent of that new order to realize economic and social integration and to embark resolutely on the path of sustainable development. in conclusion, with respect to my countrys stability, before the general assembly, i once again appeal to france that a frank and sincere dialogue finally be set up between our two closely linked nations on the question of the comorian island of mayotte. it has grown increasingly clear that the fact that mayotte remains under french administration constitutes a threat to the peace and stability of the three other comorian islands the peace that remains the foundation of freedom and prosperity. it is true, and a secret to no one, that that island has always served as a rear guard for the detractors of the comoros, those who would prefer not to see our country move forward despite its great potential. moreover, the year 2012, now drawing to a close, proved particularly dramatic for my people. men, women and children aboard f limsy boats known as kwassa kwassa perished in the narrow waters that separate the comorian islands of anjouan and mayotte because of the visas that france imposed on the comorians of the other islands. surely that painful, unacceptable situation, which has lasted for decades, cannot fail to move this worldwide assembly, whose chosen theme for this year is bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means, including the rule of law at the national and international levels. i therefore hope that france will honour its commitments as a country that respects international law. finally, i hope it will respond positively to our urgent call so that together we may find a positive way for mayotte to return to its natural home, which remains the union of the comoros. that is how to put an end to the humanitarian tragedy and to guarantee lasting stability for my country. it is through a definitive solution to this conflict, which has lasted far too long, that france can contribute to the ongoing efforts to enhance regional integration, and thus to safeguard the interests of this region of the indian ocean that we hope to build together in stability and peace.",Comoros,Africa,49.1961402893066,2.74783992767334,1817.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,2.201430930104568
NER,67,2012,"i would first like to congratulate the president of the general assembly at its sixty-seventh session on his election. i also wish to congratulate his country for that success, which allows him to manage the organization during his term of office. i would also like to congratulate the outgoing president, his excellency mr. nassir abdulaziz al-nasser, whose term of office was a very busy one. lastly, i would like to thank the secretary- general, mr. ban ki-moon, for the tireless work that he has undertaken through the programme he submitted for the next five years and through which he particularly focuses on sustainable development, peace, security and the participation of women and young people. sad reality shows us that some people, using the freedom of expression that is guaranteed in their own countries, have believed that that freedom includes the right to publish cartoons and to produce a video that insults islam. those acts are comparable to anti-semitic acts or racist acts in general by those who reject any differences and insist on making that a rule of conduct. we firmly condemn those actions, which are hurtful and offensive for muslims. but however disgraceful they may be, they cannot justify the outbreak of violence we have seen, especially those against diplomatic missions. in particular, we condemn the murderous attack against the united states diplomatic mission in benghazi, and we repeat here the sincere condolences of the people and government of the niger to the american people and government. we reassert that islam, a religion of balance and moderation, cannot provide a basis for such hateful responses. those who, in the name of islam, are behaving like savage hordes discredit this great religion and, in doing so, are behaving exactly like those they claim to denounce. the sad facts that i have just referred to demonstrate the wisdom of the theme the president chose to place at the centre of his mandate, that is, bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means. the peaceful settlement of disputes, we may recall, was the theme of the general debate at the sixty-sixth session. between the two sessions, the position of my country on the issue has not changed. at the sixty-sixth session, my countrys president, mr. mahamadou issoufou, said from this rostrum: we might have thought that the end of the cold war would open the way to an age of full and lasting peace around the world (a/66/pv.20, p. 17). unfortunately, because there was no ability, or perhaps not even the will, to attack the evil at its roots, the hope for a world without conflict recedes like the horizon as one approaches it. the root of the evil is bad governance, politically and economically. the promises of liberty, equality and justice, of the rule of law and solidarity promises that were made to people both globally and at the national level have still not been upheld. the lack of any regulation of the global economy, the domination of banks, unfair trade and the growth of inequalities between and within nations are factors of disorder, crises and conflicts that disrupt world peace. the rise of terrorism and the increasingly strong probability of criminal forces controlling great areas will worsen tensions throughout the world. anticipating international conflicts and disputes is the best way to prevent them. as international economic competition can lead to war, the anticipation of crises should create specific conditions for global economic growth that benefits all. to do that, there should be mechanisms to regulate the global economy with the goal, among others, of ending the hegemony of financial capital and unfair trade. the end of the hegemony of financial capital should allow us to direct available financial resources towards investments in the real economy rather than towards speculation. the end of unfair trade will allow countries that produce raw materials, such as the niger, to draw greater benefit from them, particularly through the change that generates added value. if a country such as mine were able to get a fair price for its raw materials and to establish real control over their exploitation, then the millennium development goals could be achieved by 2015. that is one of the ambitions of the programme for the renaissance of the niger that president issoufou presented. on the basis of that programme, the government has just drawn up an economic and social development plan for 2012 to 2015. for financing the programme, the niger is organizing a donors meeting to be held in paris on 13 and 14 november. the 3n initiative nigeriens nourishing nigeriens is an integral and important part of the plan. i take the opportunity here to invite all partners of the niger, both bilateral and multilateral, both public and private, to take an active part. allow me also to take the opportunity to thank all those who have responded positively to the appeal that our president launched here on 23 september 2011 during his address to the asembly at its sixtysixth session, calling for assistance to the people of the niger following that years mediocre harvest. the mobilization of the people and the government, as well as all our partners, enabled us to prevent the drought from leading to famine, while creating the conditions to prepare for the 2012-2013 harvest. the results are very promising despite the recent f looding in the country. it is said that history has more imagination than do men, because events often escape the control of those who cause them. it is my hope that this saying will not apply to the arab spring, which has created turmoil from which we hope good will come. allow me to recall the fact that at the group of eight summit in deauville on 26 may 2011, president issoufou drew the attention of the heads of state and government present on the need for them not to lose sight of the foreseeable consequences of a libyan conflict in the sahel-saharan region. his fears were unfortunately confirmed with the outbreak of the rebellion in mali on 17 january, triggered by elements from libya and followed by the coup detat of 22 march, which dealt democracy a severe blow while enabling the occupation of two thirds of malian territory, not just by external forces, some of them from libya, but also by terrorists and criminal organizations specializing in various types of trafficking, particularly drugs. in our view, the current situation in mali constitutes a serious threat to the security and stability of the member countries of the economic community of west african states (ecowas), as well as the countries in the thick of things. the ambition of the jihadists who have subjugated northern mali, destroying the patrimonial historic sites of timbuktu, cutting off hands and forcing women to wear the burka, is to conquer the whole of west africa and the maghreb. once they have achieved that goal, will they stop there? of course not. they will immediately go on to attack europe and the whole of the rest of the world. this is therefore a global threat, and the response should be global, too. it must be immediate and unhesitating, because we know well that postponing a fight always puts one at a disadvantage. therefore the international community, and the security council in particular, has a duty to take responsibility for the crisis in mali without delay in order to restore a united, democratic and secular mali. an operational concept for military intervention should be drawn up and adopted within the framework of a coalition that should include troops from ecowas member states as well as from the countries involved and from other african countries wishing to take part. such an operation should receive the firm and determined support of the friends of mali and africa among the great powers. it should be carried out through a security council resolution in a framework based on the current efforts of ecowas but better coordinated with and controlled by the african union through its peace and security council.",Niger,Africa,30.5603904724121,3.186820030212402,1343.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
MUS,67,2012,"the world is living through unprecedented times. the challenges of an economic crisis now loom large. all nations, developed and developing, face growing uncertainties about their economic prospects. serious concerns about the global economy arise now just after global prosperity had reached unprecedented heights. a second paradox is that the countries most seriously affected by the crisis are those that contributed the least to its root causes. as fallout from the crisis threatens to produce ever more significant impacts, many already vulnerable small island states also face a major threat of a different nature. the threat is an existential one. as with the economic crisis, the countries that may be most severely affected by climate change are those that have contributed the least to the root causes of climate change. many small island developing states thus face the dual threat of the impact of the worsening economies on their trading and their development partners and that of climate change. already vulnerable nations face greater threats at the international level, and more vulnerable groups face greater difficulties within nations. young people are faced with higher levels of unemployment, and women and children are faced with reduced access to public services, health and education. secretary-general ban ki-moon, speaking at the latest group of 20 meeting, put food and nutrition security at the top of the agenda. meeting the energy needs for development is a major concern. recent meetings convened by the economic and social council have again highlighted other major concerns, including structural unemployment, rising inequality and the lag in poverty eradication. many countries, both developing and developed, face a major challenge with respect to youth unemployment. improving access to education and tackling the mismatch between qualifications and employment are now a top policy goal. the world cannot let its young people down and must give them an opportunity to contribute to economic recovery and prosperity. what we do for young people and what they can do for the world they will inherit will shape the economic future of our world. as all nations work to promote sustainable development, essential components of governance required to achieve that goal include more equitable and inclusive growth, the fight against corruption, greater accountability, more transparency and a general culture of integrity. mauritius affirms that along with initiatives to revisit development objectives, reform of the international financial architecture and global economic governance must remain a top priority. mauritius strongly supports the view that the present economic crisis is of a global nature and that solutions for inclusive green growth also need to be global in nature. the inconclusive talks of the doha round and those on the united nations climate change convention both suffered from a historical divide that regrettably resurfaces from time to time and is resurfacing now at a time when global solutions are more than ever necessary. the debate over good economic and fiscal governance at the national level will always remain valid and necessary but, however sound such domestic policies may be, the global environment will have an impact on growth and development, especially on that of developing countries and smaller economies. thirty-two years ago, the independent commission on international development issues highlighted, in the 1980 brandt report, the interdependence of developing and developed economies and the mutuality of their interests. the report explained how all nations would benefit from a strengthened global economy. as the world faces another crisis, all nations should recall how much interdependence has grown since the brandt report and bear in mind the interconnection and mutuality of interests in the development agenda. in that context, nations must resist protectionist measures as an easy way out. they would definitely be detrimental in the medium and long term. the committee for development policy, in its july 2012 report (e/2012/33), called for a transformative development agenda. the international community must pledge its support for a transformative agenda based on the recognition that globally coordinated solutions are necessary to accompany sound domestic policies. it is imperative that the general assembly, with its pre-eminent and universal membership, play a crucial role in the debate on globally coordinated solutions. we reaffi rm our support for a revitalized economic and social council, which should be able to exercise the effective role and function attributed to it by the charter. in that context, we also welcome the reaffirmation of the mandate of the united nations conference on trade and development (unctad) at doha. unctad must continue to serve as the focal point of the united nations system for the integrated treatment of trade and development and the interrelated issues of finance, technology, investment and sustainable development. as the world engages in the current debate on global solutions, we must promote more economic exchanges among developing nations. regional integration and cooperation are key to future development. trade and investment must also be accompanied by greater regional cooperation through the pooling of resources and the provision of public goods. pooling entails increased economies of scale and makes it less costly to acquire technology. one area where regional cooperation can make a significant contribution is the energy sector. pooling resources and coordinating policies at the regional level and among groups of developing countries with common requirements can facilitate the development of technology and the implementation of renewable energies. as we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the united nations convention on the law of the sea, let us remind ourselves of the potential of the oceans as an engine for growth and promote international cooperation in a vast collective effort to tap that potential. there is potential there with respect not only to food and mineral resources but also to transport, leisure and the advancement of science. we welcome the reaffirmation by world leaders in rio de janeiro that small island developing states remain a special case for sustainable development in view of their unique and particular vulnerabilities. we expect that the commitment to take urgent and concrete action to address the vulnerabilities of small island developing states will be followed by concrete actions. it is imperative that small island developing states issues be more effectively mainstreamed throughout the entire united nations system and that a dedicated and clearly identified focal point be set up within every united nations entity dealing with small island developing states issues. the small island developing states unit within the department of economic and social affairs should be strengthened to enable it to provide coordinated support for small island developing states. mauritius joins other world leaders who have called on all countries to deliver on their assistance commitments. the international community cannot spend so much capital on negotiating new pledges and undertakings in a whole array of outcome documents and then ignore what has been agreed. we can move forward only if past commitments are honoured. we welcome the proposed establishment of a sustainable development council to follow up on the united nations conference on sustainable development and formulate sustainable development goals. we also welcome the appointment of a high-level panel on the post-2015 development agenda. those entities and others should be able to build on what has already been agreed through global negotiations. i must say that our hearts go out to the people of syria, who are enduring the consequences of a severe humanitarian crisis, as there is no prospect in sight of a resolution to the political struggle. the international community cannot remain indifferent to such suffering. the world can also not remain indifferent to the suffering of the palestinian people, who are without a universally recognized state and face severe economic hardships and insecurity. those challenges will test the credibility and moral authority of the international system. i must also say that, while we have the utmost respect for all faiths and religions, we strongly believe that there is no justification for violence, however profound the outrage in response to religious vilification. we also support the fundamental principle of the protection of diplomats and diplomatic premises, which is at the core of the interaction between nations, and we call on all members of the comity of nations to fully respect that principle. we also call on the international community to support the full implementation of the road map worked out in our neighbouring state of madagascar and to provide the transitional government with the means to ensure a speedy return to constitutional rule and democracy in that great country. mauritius very much welcomed the high- level meeting of the assembly on the rule of law. development and greater economic prosperity go hand in hand with enhanced rule of law at both the national and the international levels. there will be no meaningful rule of law at the international level unless and until all nations, especially the small ones, have avenues for resolving their disputes with other states. the united kingdom excised part of mauritian territory prior to independence, has refused to enter into talks in good faith on that dispute and has ensured that the dispute cannot be resolved by the international court of justice. thus, the decolonization of africa has not been completed. at a time when the united nations debates the rule of law at both the national and the international levels, we urge the international community to work on machinery that would enable states, whatever their size or economic power, to have at their disposal judicial and other peaceful means of resolving disputes. the rule of law at the international level cannot be normative only. there must also be adequate enforcement mechanisms, without which there is no meaningful rule of law. the full realization of the territorial integrity of mauritius also requires a settlement that would enable us to effectively assert our sovereignty over tromelin island. we look forward to continued dialogue with france in a spirit of mutual cooperation. the challenges that our countries currently face call for exemplary solidarity on the part of the community of nations. our common interests must guide all of our actions. we will not be able to pull through without each other. all governments, civil society, researchers and entrepreneurs must therefore be aware of the interdependence of our economies and work together for the good of all nations. countries often turn inwards in times of crisis and look out only for what they believe to be their own interests. however, true solutions are collective. a global recovery would serve the interests of all states. before i end, let me convey to the assembly

TUN,67,2012,"i should like to start by conveying to the friendly republic of serbia and to president jeremic personally my most heartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of the general assembly at its sixty-seventh session. i should like also to congratulate mr. nassir abdulaziz al-nasser, president of the assembly at its previous session, as well as mr. ban ki-moon, for the efforts that they have undertaken in favour of all peoples aspirations that are aimed at achieving stability, peace, security and development throughout the world. i should like to convey to them the congratulations of my people, who, through the revolution of 17 december 2010, entered the fraternity of free people and democratic states. i should now like to express our views regarding the major issues facing our world today. today we are witnessing the great evil perpetrated by a few groups that are using the media to disseminate their destructive and chaotic views. that makes clear the great chasm that exists with respect to the psychological, social and economic crises of our societies, which, unfortunately, exacerbate the phenomena of violence and extremism. those warning signals need to be addressed very seriously. the first and second world wars did not happen in a vacuum; they were the result of extremist statements and policies that led to human carnage and claimed tens of millions of lives. we in tunisia believe that we must work under the auspices of the united nations to bring about peace for all humankind and to avert confrontations between civilizations. tunisias access to this forum of free and democratic peoples came at a very high cost. tens of thousands of political prisoners, as well as exiles, were tortured before the revolution; they were the ones who paid the price. during the revolution, more than 300 citizens were killed and 2,000 others injured. a year and a half after the revolution, tunisia continues to move forward. we are, however, faced by a great many difficult economic and social problems, the legacy of a regime that lasted for more than two decades and whose practices included corruption, fraud and repression. but that price is negligible when compared with that paid by our brothers in egypt, yemen and libya, and, of course, by our brothers in syria, more than 25,000 of whom have been killed and tens of thousands injured, along with the destruction of the countrys infrastructure. all of that will forever mark the syrian people and affect their future for decades to come. that high price is something we all should remember in facing the difficulties that hamper us in the building of an international system that will work to avert, lay siege to and curtail those accursed political systems that threaten the freedom of peoples and peace among peoples. the republic of tunisia, which has just emerged from dictatorship and which is well aware of the high toll taken by such a regime, proposes that we create a new mechanism to fight dictatorships, which are a disease threatening peace, stability and security as well as the prosperity of peoples. they not only have an impact on the freedom of people in a given country, but they also give rise to hatred and wars. europe was able to enjoy peace, stability and prosperity only after the fall of the fascist, nazi and communist dictatorships. in the medical field, methods were developed by the world health organization that made possible the elimination of polio in the twentieth century; that would have seemed pure fiction to doctors in the nineteenth century. we have acquired political maturity and awareness in the face of dictatorship, which, more than diseases, poses a serious threat to the lives of hundreds of millions of people. because the united nations, through its charter and institutions, has at its disposal a legal arsenal that can serve to bring about basic freedoms and peace among peoples, we invite the organization to declare that dictatorship is a social and political scourge that must be eliminated through the combined efforts of all peoples throughout the world. it behoves us to implement a bold and ambitious programme to eliminate dictatorship in the same manner in which we got rid of polio and smallpox. the creation of the international criminal court (icc) demonstrates that we are on a historic journey of building international institutions that has not yet been completed. the icc is but a further step in the direction of the complete elimination of dictatorship. however, the court tackles crimes only after their commission; what we require are mechanisms to prevent dictatorship from taking root in the first place. contemporary dictatorships are based on the use of excessive force and give themselves false legality through the holding of fraudulent elections. they use the appearance of democracy to undermine democracy itself. those kinds of elections took place in tunisia in 1999, 2004 and 2009. our deposed dictator was prepared to remain in power forever. he intended, for the 2014 elections, to rewrite the constitution so he could run for a third term. each time he re-imposed the status quo because he knew that no internal domestic or international mechanisms existed that could rein in his political activities. during that entire period, the tunisian democratic opposition could not but note the paralysis of domestic and international laws and legal mechanisms. it was simply impossible for the opposition to turn to a tunisian or international constitutional court. although it was normal that such a constitutional court did not exist in the country, it certainly was not normal that a mechanism to that effect should fail to exist within the united nations, because the charter of the united nations and the universal declaration of human rights, as well as many other international conventions and instruments, backed by general assembly resolutions, all are texts that could be viewed as being the charter of humankind. the only thing missing is an implementation mechanism. the republic of tunisia therefore proposes the creation of an international constitutional court similar to the icc, which could be seized of challenging illegal constitutions or charters, or fraudulent elections. such a court would have to be competent to consider a number of disputes and issues, to rule on the legality or illegality of elections that are not in line with the charter of the united nations. all systems, especially democratic ones, would face the clear duty of being recognized by the international constitutional court. the court would also make recommendations and provide the necessary advice to all those who so request. the body could serve as a deterrent against any despot, any tyrannical regime, in the case of any such regime forging election results. the court would contribute to the very disappearance of those regimes, because it would strengthen the role of peaceful civic resistance. otherwise, the only choice would be to live under oppression or to turn to violence. we all know just how expensive that can be. tunisia strongly advocates the protection of the environment to ensure that we leave succeding generations a sustainable world. we also want to leave a world living in peace and to douse the flames of war in afghanistan, mali, the democratic republic of the congo, the sudan and the middle east. tunisia requests rapid humanitarian intervention to help save the heroic syrian people and to ensure the departure of president bashar al-assad and his criminal regime. we call for the deployment of an arab peace force to guarantee the transition and to create a democratic state, which would be pluralistic and that could live in peace. tunisia wishes to reiterate its support for the palestinian people and their right to a just peace and the release of thousands of prisoners. we support the creation of a palestinian state with al-quds as its capital and with membership in this organization. we condemn violence against women and children. we denounce the fanaticism, the anti-semitism and the islamophobia that one often sees. we call for tolerance to allow all religious minorities, including muslims in burma and christians living in all muslim countries, to exercise their faith freely. the chasm between the rich and the poor must be reduced. during the upcoming nuclear materials conference, tunisia will insist on the need to free the middle east from nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. we champion pluralistic, tolerant civilian societies and institutions. tunisia is the country of peaceful democratic revolution. tunisia asks the general assembly to draw upon article 22 of the charter of the united nations, by which it may establish such subsidiary organs as it deems necessary, and create an international constitutional court and to include this item in the agenda of its sixty-eighth session. i hope this proposal will enjoy the broadest possible support by democratic states and the mobilization of the international community, which played such an important role in the creation of the international criminal court. we hope that the same will be done to ensure that the proposed international constitutional court becomes a part of a comprehensive system that would enable our people and succeeding generations to avoid a scourge of blood and tears like that which has cost us so dearly.",Tunisia,Africa,80.21875,5.950860023498535,1532.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.6527415143603134
MDG,67,2012,"as president of the transition of madagascar, it is a great honour for me to participate in the general debate of the united nations for the second time. the theme of the sixty-seventh session is akin to a call for unity, for shared contemplation and for generally revisiting existential questions and human values in the face of situations around the world where peace is extremely precarious. the last few years have indeed been marked by differences of opinion, political disputes and conflicts of interest. the world today faces new challenges to stability and the maintenance of peace. various efforts and initiatives have been undertaken to deal with conflicts that are not homogeneous and disputes that do not always play out along the same lines. peoples interests differ and their approaches are not all equal. today the list of the forms that global conflicts take leads us to an obvious reality: geostrategic variations conform to no one rule, and they are in perpetual f lux. the wise words of secretary-general ban ki-moon in his statement at the opening of the sixteenth summit of the non-aligned movement seem particularly revealing in that context. did he not stress that among the challenges that must be met, there are all too many political disputes between member states of the non-aligned movement itself? did he not urge the protagonists in the syrian crisis to immediately institute a ceasefire and a halt to the violence? and yet we can only deplore the fact that his call produced no result. scores of innocent people are still dying every day, and over recent months they now number in the thousands. we firmly condemn this loss of human life. the earth continues to run with the blood of innocents, spilled violently not only in syria but in other parts of the world as well. given this state of affairs, despite the complexity of the challenges those conflicts present, the secretary- general has not stood idle. we can only commend his determination to strive tirelessly to seek a negotiated settlement. states and other bodies must join forces to maintain peace, stability and security in the world. we cannot be passive witnesses to current or future disasters. the republic of madagascar sets particular store by the relevance and importance of the principles set forth in the united nations charter, as a source of inspiration as well as a pillar of support for the interdependence of nations and peoples. that being the case, human rights, the law of states, the rule of law and the other international regulatory tools place before leaders their responsibilities. the league of nations defined the rule of law as a principle of governance based on the submission of all individuals and institutions, including the state, to the adopted and published laws, without distinction as to social or economic status; on the equality of everyone before an independent, impartial justice system; and on the harmonization of national laws with international human rights standards. no one should be above the law, and the culture of impunity must be banished. mr. benmehidi (algeria), vice-president, took the chair. national conflicts today transcend borders and are becoming international problems. more than ever, the role of diplomacy and international negotiations face difficulties. the consequences of disputes play out in a number of ways, including with problems of impunity, instability in the arab and muslim world, the case of somali piracy, illegal immigrations, persons displaced by war, problems regarding the rom issue, religious confrontations, management of land and sea borders, and food insecurity. it is undeniable that much remains to be done to save human lives, because still civilian populations remain the primary victims of conflicts and disputes throughout the world. the world is in upheaval, and many countries are in a situation of transition. their peoples demand change and hope for sustainable development. those countries need to be supported and encouraged, not sanctioned. in that context, allow me to highlight the case of my own country, madagascar. madagascar is a country emerging from crisis, thanks to the involvement of the bodies of the southern african development community and the support of the african union, the indian ocean commission and the international organization of la francophonie. a road map was signed and adopted by the malagasy political parties in september 2011. thus, several significant steps have been taken. the malagasy parties have honoured their commitments. all the transitional institutions have been set up, including a national unity government and the transitional parliament. the road map, which we can call a political agreement, has allowed us to launch the electoral process. madagascar needs to take its destiny into its own hands, to write its own history, and to end the cycle of political instability through the holding of credible and transparent elections, guaranteed by the establishment of the independent national electoral commission of the transition. above all, recently, in concert with united nations experts, the electoral timetable for madagascar was officially announced, including the holding of presidential elections scheduled for 8 may 2013. thus i launch a solemn appeal to all international partners, all member states and friends of madagascar to support us and encourage us in that approach, which is the only and most democratic path forward. profoundly committed to the values of solidarity, tolerance and peace, madagascar is now searching for swift development and a better future. during the three and a half years of transition and despite all attempts at destabilization, we have worked tirelessly every day to honour our commitments and ensure the protection of our countrymen, all the while addressing social problems. in spite of challenging times, and despite the suspension of international aid and subsidies, which once accounted for 60 per cent of the state budget, we have been able to keep the administration functioning normally and have honoured all our commitments and debts. madagascar is indeed one of the least developed countries. nevertheless, it is one of the least indebted countries in the world since its debt amounts to only 5 per cent of gross domestic product (gdp), compared to other countries whose debt rate can reach up to 238 per cent of gdp. therefore, it is possible to develop our country and create our wealth through our own resources. that is the challenge that we are meeting. now it is high time to embark on in-depth reform to create an effective system that meets the highest expectations of our respective populations not forgetting, obviously, the need to double or even triple our commitments to fighting poverty and promoting sustainable development. here today, i launch an appeal for international solidarity to channel the transition towards the building of a more promising future but without stif ling us. the malagasy people need their full and entire independence, but above all they must be able to hold transparent and therefore democratic elections. i know that everyone here is sincerely willing to lend us support. so allow me to give the assembly the solution. the best way to help us is to trust us, honour the commitments made and let us shoulder our own responsibilities. in the name of universal values and principles, anyone meeting the conditions of eligibility dictated by law is fully entitled to exercise that liberty. that is a fundamental principle, and all states must respect it. the malagasy people alone not other countries or external pressure have the sovereign right to decide who should guide their destiny. the malagasy people alone will choose the man or woman who will lead madagascar. if confidence is shown in the malagasy people, they will be grateful. the concepts of non-interference and respect for the sovereignty of each country establish mutual trust, which is a basic rule for all international negotiations. they are among the peaceful means needed to build lasting peace. efforts must be made to put an end to the inequalities in how countries in political crisis are treated. the realities on the ground and popular aspirations must be acknowledged in order to avoid making the wrong decision. despite our disagreements and our differences on how to achieve a peaceful settlement of our conflicts, we the states members of the united nations are unanimous in our firm desire for peace. the united nations system cannot just be the police of the world; it also needs to be a source of hope and of values. our societies need to exist and find their way through their own values, because it is social and economic ills, injustice, the lack of protection for vulnerable populations and intolerance for minorities that often cause states to collapse. as far as its modest means allow, the republic of madagascar is determined to contribute to achieving our shared goals. the peace accord is fragile and needs to develop. to quote martin luther king, jr., all progress is precarious, and the solution of one problem brings us face to face with another problem. it is our duty and responsibility to provide a better future for the generations to come. global stability requires tolerance, assistance, the creation and equitable sharing of wealth, and poverty reduction through sustainable development and reconciliation. the principles of adjustment or settlement of international disputes by peaceful means requires a return to our values, gender balance and equality, and, above all, democratic alternation. god bless our nation!",Madagascar,Africa,71.5726165771484,2.463573112943822,1553.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.643915003219575
UGA,67,2012,"uganda joins other delegations in congratulating mr. jeremic on his election as president of this body. my delegation has full confidence in his ability to steer our deliberations, and he can count on our support. i also wish to commend mr. nassir abdulaziz al-nasser for his effective leadership during the last session. the international community has made significant progress in reducing conflicts around the world over the two decades since the end of the cold war and the eventual freedom of south africa from apartheid. however, we still face challenges arising from conflicts that take a heavy toll on nations and people around the world. the theme for this sessions debate is therefore timely and pertinent. we are again seeing an increase in conflicts brought about by unconstitutional changes of governments, disputed elections, social tensions, extremist ideologies and territorial or border disputes, among other causes. we must redouble our efforts to resolve conflicts and disputes through peaceful means and in conformity with justice and international law, as enshrined in the charter of the united nations. from ugandas experience over the years, conflicts are best handled, first and foremost, by the political actors and citizens of the countries in question, following democratic principles and guided by the principle of equality of all persons before the law. in cases where national actors for some reason cannot resolve the problem, then subregional organizations should step in. in the case of africa those include the east african community, the intergovernmental authority on development, the international conference on the great lakes region (icglr), the southern african development community, the economic community of west african states and others. the united nations and the international community would then provide the necessary support to subregional and regional initiatives. our recent achievements in the peace processes in burundi, the sudan, south sudan and somalia, among others, attest to the progress we can achieve by working together. the advantages of such an approach include the use of local actors who have more discerning knowledge of the problems and those in close proximity and with a greater stake in getting the problems resolved. in addition, there is the international support and legitimacy that the united nations provides. the current icglr initiative on the situation in the east of the democratic republic of the congo is based on such experience. we call upon the security council and the international community to give the necessary support to the decisions of the icglr summit held in kampala on 8 september. that regional initiative is aimed at addressing the root causes of the conflict in eastern congo, deploying a neutral international force and responding to the humanitarian crisis. our preference for home-grown solutions is premised on the realization that external influences or interventions do not necessarily offer sustainable solutions for the resolution of conflicts. on the contrary, external interventions often contribute to a cycle of destabilizing tendencies which is why we are still grappling with situations like the one in eastern congo. the african union (au) has shown strong political will to resolve conflicts on the continent peacefully and to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. we call upon our partners to support the dispute resolution mechanisms, as well as the peace and security efforts of the au and subregional organizations. ugandas participation in and contribution to conflict resolution in our subregion, on the african continent and on the international scene are guided by that approach, which has proved to be largely successful in resolving conflicts and wars. regional initiatives need to be complemented by international support, including assisting countries emerging from conflict to build the requisite capacities for the consolidation of peace. it is also important that such support include provision of immediate post- conflict humanitarian assistance and material input for reconstruction and development. we welcome the continuing deepening of cooperation between the united nations and regional and subregional organizations in the resolution of conflicts and the maintenance of peace and security. this positive trend should continue, and every effort should be made to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. uganda strongly believes that conflicts that might arise between and within countries should be resolved through dialogue among all the parties concerned. in the recent past we have witnessed regrettable instances in which peace initiatives have been frustrated through the intransigence of the parties, with support from some members of the international community. that can only be a recipe for long-term turmoil and instability in the affected countries and neighbouring regions. in our view, in situations of armed conflict the first priority should be securing a verifiable ceasefire, followed by a political process involving an all-inclusive dialogue without preconditions. it is up to the parties, with the assistance of a mediator or facilitator, to reach a settlement that addresses their interests. there is no doubt that resolving conflicts requires identifying and addressing their underlying causes, which include social, political and economic factors that are often deeply entrenched and interwoven. in seeking to resolve any conflict, national, regional and international actors need to adopt approaches that take into account the following complexities. first, it is important to address the substantive issues that give rise to conflicts in the first place, such as lack of access to or inequitable distribution of resources, social or political exclusion and other grievances. the linkage between development and security in peacebuilding is now widely recognized, and once conflicts are resolved, the affected communities need peace dividends in terms of delivery of basic services such as health and education as well as opportunities for employment. secondly, efforts should be made to defuse the fear, hatred and other negative emotions that make conflicts intractable and often violent. we must collectively speak out against intolerance and extremism in order to advance mutual respect and understanding of the values and beliefs of others. uganda condemns all acts of terrorism and violence. we strongly condemn the recent spate of violence and attacks, including targeting diplomatic missions of the united states and other member states. thirdly, political leaders and all actors need to forge national reconciliation, including through transitional justice mechanisms, as well as establishing truth and reconciliation mechanisms, which play a key role in promoting durable peace. we would also like to reiterate the need to increase the role of women and youth in the peaceful settlement of disputes, given the significant contribution they can make. on the israeli-palestinian question, uganda continues to call upon both parties to negotiate and reach a peaceful settlement based on a two-state solution, with a palestinian state living side by side with israel in peace, security and mutual recognition. finally, we affirm our commitment to the peaceful settlement of conflicts and to fostering international cooperation based on the principles of sovereign equality, justice and adherence to international law.",Uganda,Africa,70.1982192993164,1.797469973564148,1133.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,2.64783759929391
CPV,67,2012,"i convey my greetings to the president of the general assembly, mr. vuk jeremic, whom i congratulate on his election. i wish him success during his tenure as president of the general assembly at its sixty-seventh session. i would also like to convey my greetings to the former president of the general assembly at its sixty-sixth session, mr. nassir abdulaziz al-nasser of the state of qatar, for the excellent work he accomplished during his tenure. also allow me to express my appreciation to secretary-general ban ki-moon for his competent management of the organization. we reaffirm our trust in his leadership during a particularly difficult time in our history during one of the worst financial crises that the world has ever known that has had repercussions in the economic, social, political, food, energy and environmental sectors, to say nothing of the terrible threats to peace and security emanating from every corner of the world. as a small island state, with a shortage of resources and with only 37 years of independence, cape verde is proud to be a democratic country that is based on the rule of law, built with the suffering and the determination of cape verdeans inside and outside our country. notwithstanding the fact that my country faces enormous difficulties in ensuring its own existence and that to overcome them will require international solidarity, i believe that cape verde can, although modestly, contribute towards finding solutions to important problems that threaten the troubled world of our time. apart from the political stability that has characterized us as well as the build-up and consolidation of a democratic system, the cape verdean nation that preceded the creation of the state can be considered an example of peaceful coexistence among peoples who originated from different countries, with different creeds integrated into what had already been a mixed sculture. our nation stands open to the world and to the exchange of values. cape verde has opted for a policy for peace, dialogue and understanding in the resolution of conflicts. the expression of those values is part of the cape verdean peoples way of living and being. ours is a culture of tolerance that has shaped, in the almost four decades of its history, the values and principles of the countrys policies. besides our modest political contribution to the resolution of conflicts in southern africa, for example, the end of apartheid in south africa, the independence of namibia and peace in angola, i would assert that our biggest contribution has been our way of life as a people and as a culture. through our way of life, we have been able to show that tolerance and the sharing of values can be part of daily living, even in adverse conditions. our way of life has allowed successive cape verdean governments and heads of state to manage the foreign policy of our country in a consistent manner, giving priority to peace, justice and the peaceful coexistence of people in the formulation of policy. accordingly, our foreign policy is the expression or translation of our culture and our ideology. that is also what guides me as i strive to broaden cape verdes contribution to our continent and, hopefully, to the world. on 25 september, we celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the constitution of the republic of cape verde, which is proof of the stability we enjoy in our country. it has allowed numerous presidential, legislative and municipal elections to take place, and changes in power have occurred with the highest degree of normality. by happy coincidence, that critical date for cape verde 25 september coincides with the launch of the sixty-seventh session of the general assembly, that exponent of democracy on a global level which is undergoing a process of revitalization. as such, i am very grateful to be able to share our milestone with general assembly. the magna law stipulates that our domestic legal order incorporates the precedents and standards of international common law and the law of treaties as lawfully approved and ratified. it is thus clear that we attach great importance to institutions like the united nations and the principles that guide them. nevertheless, we are aware that if those principles, which we have embedded in our constitution, including those referring to human rights, do not trickle down into our day-to-day culture, the constitution will not be fulfilled in its entirety. we therefore urge all cape verdeans, be they in the country or outside, to further internalize the values of our constitution, which we consider a critical step in ensuring its vitality and full realization. despite the serious issues arising in the world and the vulnerabilities of the cape verdean economy and its direct impact on the living conditions of the majority of its people, i must say without false modesty that i am proud of the trajectory that my country has followed since its independence. at independence, our annual gross domestic product (gdp) was $190 per capita, whereas today it has grown to $3,295 per capita per annum. several social indices have mirrored that growth, making it possible for us to achieve some of the millennium development goals. in fact, the human development, economic and financial results registered in the biennium 2011-2012 received positive reviews from the major international financial institutions. ours is a service economy with services accounting for 80 per cent of gdp in 2010 with a very small market and an agricultural sector that is struggling with desertification and drought. we therefore cannot ignore our great vulnerabilities or rest on our laurels for having graduated to a medium-income developed country. on the contrary, we cannot lose sight of the fact that our economy is still very dependent, that it cannot employ a significant portion of its potential workforce, with all the social consequences that stem from that. we are therefore obliged to continue to rely on international solidarity. we of course will continue to use our meagre resources in an efficient and rational manner and develop even more effective efforts to combat poverty, social exclusion and unemployment, which in 2010 reached an overall rate of 21 per cent, and 50 per cent among youth. constraints with respect to energy, water and sanitation continue to garner our full attention so that, as we build key infrastructure, we can create the conditions needed to achieve sustainable growth in our economy. we also must take into account the fact that the impact on small island developing states of climate change and natural disasters is a sword of damocles threatening our future. it is imperative that all countries, acting consistently and with solidarity, implement environmental defence programmes, develop the green economy and help build true global resilience. one of the most remarkable characteristics of todays world is the increasing interdependence of all sectors. we may speak frequently of the economy, but that is because it conditions all the rest the environmental, health, security, political and cultural sectors, indeed, nearly all areas of human activity. it is therefore fundamental for us to constantly monitor all relevant aspects of those complex relationships so that we can understand the leading trends that have an impact on our process of development, but also so that we can contribute even modestly to solving the problems of people and countries across the globe. although social and political stability are essential aspects of our society, we cannot ignore the fact that on our continent, africa, that has not been a basic characteristic for internal and, to some extent, external reasons. i express my deep concern about the economic and financial global crisis that continues to severely punish the governments and defenceless populations of the african continent. those people are already suffering from hunger, the scourge of aids, the consequences of other endemic diseases, the f light of hundreds of thousands of displaced people and the overwhelming environmental degradation to which the continent is victim. despite the fact that the continent least contributed to that imbalance, it is africa that most suffers from its consequences. such crises also affect security not only because of regional conflicts but also owing to the universal dimension that terrorism has assumed. in that regard, it has affected a good part of our continent with its links to trafficking in drugs and persons, maritime piracy, religious intolerance and the problems that arise from the political, social or military instability prevailing in many of our countries. that is fertile territory for terrorism and its growth. the recent cases of mali, guinea-bissau and others, such as the sudan, somalia, the democratic republic of the congo and some countries of the maghreb, well illustrate the situation. the international community has every interest in resolutely focusing on the fight to eradicate such ills. despite those constraints, it should be acknowledged that the new wave of african leaders has been doing a great deal for the continents progress. the international community must therefore help such countries to find appropriate solutions to the situations that they face, without interfering or acting in the interests of others rather than of our people. in any case, an organization such as the united nations, which is a depository of values that respect legality and international law, should never, through its silence, promote, further or support solutions that merely legitimize unconstitutional actions. it is clear that much remains to be done. in our view, as i have said before, in africa there has been no lack of mechanisms, declarations, recommendations, programmes and projects with assessments and perspectives that disregard the political, institutional, social and cultural elements and sometimes resemble a vicious cycle. there is no real development because there is no peace. democracy is not deeply rooted because it conflicts with cultural and moral traditions. there is no peace on account of the intolerance and social exclusion that prevent its citizens from building a free, fair, democratic and pluralistic society. that, at times, exacerbates armed conflicts and other social ills. africa needs a new train of thought that does not reject the universal values of democracy but, on the contrary, uses them to enrich its own development process with a dialectic between modernity and tradition, freedom and the tendency for its own conditioning, the demands of its economic development and the fight against exclusion and social inequality, and reality and preconceptions. africa needs to regain its self-confidence. africa still needs to see stronger links between the united nations and the african union for a true development partnership. it is time to take decisions on issues such as global trade and climate change on the basis of global negotiations that are grounded in fair, equal and ethical rules and that are in step with the countries of the south, in general, and of my continent, in particular. that would give legitimacy to other forums, that is, in the context of the world trade organization, the food and agriculture organization of the united nations and united nations framework convention on climate change. in short, we call for decisions on specific measures that will result in effective decision-taking within this organization on development areas, such as cancelling the foreign debt of developing countries, in particular small island developing states. we are certain that that would be a stimulus for all such countries to achieve the millennium development goals in 2015. in 2009, secretary-general ban ki-moon affirmed at princeton university that the united nations needed a new vision, a new paradigm, a new multilateralism. that would help to ensure global economic and financial stability, combat poverty, re-establish peace, respond to the effects of climate change, improve global health, fight against terrorism and ensure disarmament and non-proliferation. at the closing ceremony of the united nations conference on sustainable development (rio+20) in june, it was stated that rio+20 had shown that multilateralism was an irreplaceable instrument for the global expression of democracy. we reaffirm that that is the legitimate path for finding solutions to problems that affect all humankind. i support and welcome such statements. in conclusion, the world has developed immensely since the end of the cold war. the current multilateral system must align itself with the new challenges. for the united nations to continue to be an efficient and vital instrument for the international community in this new era of multilateral relations, it will have to open up, innovate, listen to other voices and accept the new political, economic and social realities that have been created and imposed by the globalization process. the reform of the security council an organ that is responding less and less every day to the challenges of the contemporary world is a goal that has long been pursued, without success. cape verde supports the position of the african union, which recommends that the council be reformed so as to correct the unjust situation with respect to the african continent. at present africa does not have the right to even one permanent seat on the council, even though it meets all the requirements. i conclude, mr. president, with the conviction that africa can also provide a valuable contribution to the development of a better world, one without war, where peace is not just a theoretical concept; a world with more freedom, justice and security in other words, a world with more fraternity and prosperity, in which the well-being of its citizens is effectively provided for.",Cabo

MAR,67,2012,"his majesty king mohammed vi asked me to convey his appreciation and respect, and i am pleased to read my speech at the sixty-seventh session of the general assembly. first, i would like to warmly congratulate mr. vuk jeremic, president of the general assembly at its sixty- seventh session, on his election. that election is a mark of esteem for the friendly country of serbia as much as it is a recognition of the vast diplomatic experience he brings to the presidency. i also would like to commend mr. jeremics predecessor, mr. nassir abdulaziz al-nasser, president of the general assembly at its sixty-sixth session, on his efforts and achievements during the past year. similarly, i would like to commend secretary- general ban ki-moon for his untiring action and his keen desire to tackle crises. i applaud his initiatives aimed at enabling the united nations to rise to the growing challenges facing our world. sweeping changes are affecting todays international arena. they include, in particular, a protracted global economic crisis that has various implications and consequences. there are also a growing number of hotbeds of tension, political disputes and armed conflicts, as well as complex global challenges that exceed the capabilities of individual states, such as achieving sustainable development, protecting the environment, ensuring respect for human rights and fighting against the growing scourge of international terrorism and all forms of organized crime. given the current changes in the world, we, the states members of the united nations, ought to provide the organization with the means it needs to tackle those challenges. to that end, we must expand the scope of the organizations actions and revitalize its approach, while preserving its principles and purposes, so as to make it an active player in ensuring effective political governance and an instrument for equitable economic governance. the kingdom of morocco fully backs the decision to give special importance to resolving disputes by peaceful means. my country applauds the general assemblys decision to make the strengtheing of the foremost principle in the charter of the united nations the key objective of the current session. achieving international peace and security remains the core historic mission entrusted to the united nations. the tens of thousands of united nations peacekeepers serving throughout the world to protect civilians and working to bring about the right conditions for political dialogue between the concerned parties clearly attest to the vital role played by our organization in that regard. the kingdom of morocco takes pride in being one of the first states to have contributed to peacekeeping operations under the united nations banner. so far, my country has sent more than 50,000 members of the royal armed forces to places around the world to serve in promoting the lofty objectives of the united nations. morocco will remain committed to managing crises and will support efforts to promote preventive diplomacy. the experience gained by the united nations in conflict-affected countries points to the importance of securing smooth, systematic transition from peace restoration to peace consolidation. that requires, above all, a prompt response to the pressing needs raised by current developments and threats. otherwise, the threat of a return to violence and partition will continue to hang over the countries and regions concerned. during the past year, the african continent has seen a serious deterioration in the situation on the continent, particularly in the sahel and the sahara regions, owing to criminal, terrorist and separatist activities, which now threaten the stability of the countries concerned. our sister nation, the republic of mali, is confronted with a situation that threatens the country and its national unity and territorial integrity. despite the sincere efforts exerted by countries in the region, including morocco and the economic community of west african states, the contribution of the united nations is also needed in order to achieve national consensus, overcome the political crisis and confront separatist activities in the north. only an independent, focused effort on the part of the united nations can help achieve those objectives. i should like, in that respect, to reiterate to our brothers in mali moroccos commitment to continue to provide them with aid and active support for the success of the political process and the preservation of their countrys national unity and territorial integrity. at the same time, the kingdom of morocco lauds the notable progress made in several parts of africa, especially in the sister nations of cote divoire and the democratic republic of the congo, towards the promotion of national reconciliation and a return to political normalcy. moreover, morocco reiterates its firm commitment to pursuing cooperation and solidarity programmes with various african sister nations, using efficient, dy!mic approaches to south- south cooperation for the benefit of african citizens. the changes witnessed in the arab region reflect the will of the peoples involved to build democratic societies where human rights are respected and where citizens enjoy equal opportunities and a dignified life. the peoples in the sister nations of tunisia, libya, egypt and yemen have ushered in a new era and have made great headway towards a democratic transition, despite a complex and tumultuous political environment, a fact that makes it incumbent upon the international community to provide support and assistance to those countries to deal with the constraints and difficulties that they face. it is, on the other hand, most regrettable that the syrian people are each day paying a daily price in blood for their freedom. they yearn for the kind of democratic change that would enable each component of the syrian population to contribute to achieving the desired change. morocco, as the only arab country sitting on the security council, has significantly contributed to mobilizing international support for the league of arab states initiatives and resolutions. we call for concerted efforts and decisive action to compel the syrian regime to put an end to the violence. we also call for a political transition process that would allow for the full spectrum of opinions to be heard, the aspirations of the syrian people to be fulfilled, and syrias national unity and territorial integrity, as well as for stability in the entire region, to be ensured. at the same time, it is necessary to raise the financial resources required to meet the needs of refugees in neighbouring countries and those of internally displaced persons, as well as to ease the suffering of our syrian brothers and put an end to their tragedy. in that regard, morocco continues to show its solidarity by providing medical services on a daily basis to syrian refugees in the sisterly hashemite kingdom of jordan. the rapid developments in the arab region must not distract us from the fundamental, longstanding challenge of resolving the palestinian issue. in that regard, the kingdom of morocco calls for the mobilization of international support to back the steps taken by the palestinian national authority to secure non-member state status. at the same time, my country is of the view that negotiations are the best way for the palestinian people to regain their legitimate national rights and to set up an independent, fully viable and geographically contiguous palestinian state, living side by side with israel, in peace and security. i therefore look forward to seeing the international community change its approach to resolving that crisis by reconsidering its intervention mechanisms and work methods in order to ensure that direct negotiations are resumed very soon and in the best possible circumstances, under the auspices and with the commitment of the inf luential powers. that cannot be achieved if the fait accompli policy is allowed to continue. in that regard and in my capacity as chair of the al-quds committee, i have strongly condemned the israeli plan for the judaization of occupied east jerusalem, as well as the israeli plans to wipe out the citys spiritual and cultural identity and change its demographic and urban features. let me reaffirm, in that regard, that there can be no peace without east jerusalem as the capital of an independent palestinian state. steadfast in its belief in the importance and effectiveness of joint regional action, the kingdom of morocco has undertaken initiatives and bilateral contacts to inject fresh momentum into the arab maghreb union. indeed, my country believes that such a strategic, inclusive regional bloc is urgently needed; not only does it meet the legitimate aspirations of our peoples, but it is also necessitated by the security and development challenges facing the five maghreb states. in a bid to overcome obstacles that might hinder the realization of that maghreb ambition, the kingdom of morocco has contributed in a sincere, dedicated manner to negotiations aimed at finding a realistic, mutually acceptable political solution to the artificial regional dispute over the moroccan sahara a solution that would guarantee the kingdoms national unity and territorial integrity, allow for reunification to take place, and respect the characteristics of the regions populations. morocco remains committed and willing to negotiate on the basis of the principles established and repeatedly reaffirmed by the security council, as well as the autonomy initiative, which the international community has deemed serious, realistic and credible. morocco will also continue to cooperate constructively with the united nations mission for the referendum in western sahara, on the basis of the mandate entrusted to it by the security council a mandate that will not change in any way; neither in form nor substance. i cannot conclude without referring to the need for collective, effective and concerted action against all forms of extremism, hatred, xenophobia, provocation and rejection of those different from us and the undermining of their beliefs, for whatever reason and in whichever form. given the increase in appalling acts of that kind, often with tragic consequences, i believe national efforts to tackle them must be part of a concerted international strategy that should take into account existing constructive initiatives, build on the mobilization of all united nations bodies, be based on clear commitments, and encourage law-making and the dissemination of national and regional best practices in that area. it is up to us as member states to provide the necessary means and to reiterate our political will to support the organization and reform its structures and intervention mechanisms. the aim is to enhance its effectiveness in terms of achieving peace and security and promoting cooperation, while enabling it to fulfil its indispensable mission of furthering tolerance and coexistence, for the benefit of all mankind.",Morocco,Africa,69.4253921508789,5.552948385772083,1734.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.5767012687427913
ZAF,67,2012,"i thank you, sir, for the opportunity to address the general assembly at its sixty-seventh general debate. let me start by congratulating mr. vuk jeremic and the republic of serbia on his election to preside over the sixty-seventh session of the general assembly. we also acknowledge the contribution of the president of the assembly at its sixty-sixth session, mr. nassir abdulaziz al-nasser. south africa fundamentally believes in the principles and purposes contained in the charter of the united nations, and correctly so, given our nations history. this year, we are proudly celebrating 100 years of our peoples self less struggle for freedom, led by the african national congress movement. we recall with great appreciation the immense contribution of the united nations to the creation of a free and democratic south africa. in 1966, the general assembly labelled apartheid a crime against humanity in resolution 2202 a (xxi), which ultimately led to the international convention on the suppression and punishment of the crime of apartheid, later known as the apartheid convention. the united nations defined the crime of apartheid as inhuman acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them (resolution 3068 (xxviii), annex, article ii). the apartheid convention was adopted by the general assembly on 30 november 1973 and set the tone for vociferous action against apartheid around the world. let me repeat the words our leader and international icon, president nelson mandela, uttered in his very first address to the general assembly, in 1994, the first by a democratically elected leader and head of state of our country. he said, the millions of our people say thank you and thank you again, because the respect for your own dignity as human beings inspired you to act to ensure the restoration of our dignity as well. (a/49/pv.14, p.7) the theme of this session is most appropriate as it takes us back to the basics to the founding principles of the united nations. the founders intended the united nations to be the foremost multilateral forum entrusted with bringing hope, peace and order to the world. indeed, the united nations enjoys universal membership and is at the centre of global governance and multilateralism. the theme reminds us that peace is a choice. we can either choose peace as member states or choose the path of conflict. the founders of the united nations made that choice 67 years ago. they decided that the united nations must lead the world to peace. it is important for the united nations and its organs, especially the security council, to execute the organizations mandate of working for peace without fear or favour. we must not steer away from the founding objectives of the organization. the united nations faces immense pressure when the world sees the unprecedented loss of lives, as it now does in africa and the middle east. it is of concern when it appears as if the united nations were unable to act and assist, and when it comes across as paralysed in certain instances, due to the actions of some member states. we have seen a divided security council unable to muster the collective courage to say no more to warring parties in the interest of peace. that brings to the fore the need to continue and deepen the reform of the united nations and its organs to make it agile and nimble in addressing the contemporary challenges facing humanity. the debate on the reform of the united nations and its organs, in particular the security council, has been going on for the past 18 years. however, there has been no significant movement forward. i would like to focus in particular on the security council. given its mandate, the council has to be legitimate, democratic and transparent. its current composition has a propensity for deadlock and paralysis even in the face of crisis. it remains unrepresentative and undemocratic in both its composition and decision-making. we would like to see a more meaningful representation of africa in the security council. about 70 per cent of the councils agenda is taken up by issues from the african continent. the security council has to be expanded in both categories, with at least two seats for africa in the permanent category and five in the non-permanent category. in addition to seats for the continent in the composition of the council, the united nations should also fully recognize and appreciate the role of regional organizations working with the united nations in conflict management and resolution. in that regard, we urge closer collaboration with the african union (au) peace and security mechanisms, especially given the progress being made by the au in conflict resolution and peacebuilding in some parts of the continent since its formation 10 years ago. therefore, cognizance should be taken of chapter viii of the charter, in particular when dealing with african issues.that is why south africa piloted resolution 2033 (2012) during our rotating presidency of the security council in january. currently, the au continues to address one of the longest outstanding conflicts on the continent through one of its mechanisms, the african union high-level implementation panel on the sudan. together, as the international community, we recently celebrated the creation of the state of south sudan. we wish to congratulate the somalis and their leadership on choosing the path of peace, democracy and prosperity. the international community and the united nations must continue to give the people of somalia all the necessary support. africa is indeed making progress and, with united nations support, that could go further. to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes, we also wish to emphasize that the security council should carry out its charter mandate within the confines of international law. any member state or international body that implements council resolutions should be accountable to the council, so as to ensure that we avoid the abuse of internationally agreed principles such as the responsibility to protect and the protection of civilians. those principles must not be used, amongst other things, to justify the notion of regime change. they exist to prevent mass atrocities, war crimes, genocide and ethnic cleansing.we should continue the debate on them in order to develop norms and standards for accountability when actions are taken. it is also of critical importance for the united nations to closely guard its impartiality, independence and objectivity and not allow itself to be dragged into a conflict to take sides with any party under the guise of protecting civilians. the situation in the middle east, in particular the palestine-israeli question, continues to be of concern to us. the united nations should play a central and decisive role in efforts to resolve the long-standing conflict in that region. any act of aggression or violations of international law should be condemned unequivocally by the united nations at all times. as the united nations, we cannot be seen to be strong in condemning some acts while being soft on others. as south africa, we remain committed to the two-state solution based on the 1967 borders, with palestine and israel coexisting side by side in peace. let me also emphasize that south africa fully supports the application by palestine for full membership of the united nations. it is unacceptable that, even today, palestine remains outside the membership of the united nations. we trust that that matter will soon be positively concluded. in further promotion of the peaceful resolution of disputes, we believe that the sovereign right of states to nuclear energy for peaceful and civilian use should be respected in accordance with international law. we have taken note that the director general of the international atomic energy agency has been able to draw the conclusion that all declared nuclear material in iran is used for peaceful activities. clarification of the nature of undeclared materials will enable the international community to have full confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of irans nuclear programme. south africa therefore encourages iran to continue its cooperation with the agency. we should also remember that so long as some states are allowed to operate outside internationally agreed norms, such as those of the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, it will be difficult to expect others to operate within them. south africa supports the long-standing call for a nuclear-free zone in the middle east. in that regard, the peaceful resolution of the iranian nuclear issue is very important. let me use this opportunity to reiterate our support for the ongoing struggle for self-determination by the people of western sahara. we urge the international community to support their quest for freedom, human rights and dignity. we also reiterate our call for the lifting of the economic and financial embargo against the people of cuba in order to help the cuban people to gain their economic freedom. poverty, underdevelopment, lack of opportunities and competition for scarce resources contribute to some of the conflicts in the developing world, including africa. therefore, the promotion of sustainable development and the fight against poverty cannot be divorced from the quest for peace. in 2015, the united nations will be 70 years old and will also reach the target year for the achievement of the millennium development goals (mdgs). world leaders committed themselves to eradicating extreme poverty, facilitating universal primary education, attaining gender equality, improving maternal and child health, reducing the burden of disease primarily by combating hiv/aids, malaria and tuberculosis, protecting the environment, and mobilizing global partnerships for development by 2015. the heads of state also committed themselves to promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women as effective ways to combat poverty, hunger and disease and to stimulate truly sustainable development. we urge the united nations to continue promoting the achievement of the mdgs and other instruments whose tenets advance the human rights of women. we are concerned that sub-saharan africa is unlikely to meet the targets for the mdgs. awareness of that possibility should not make us give up; in the next three years, we must accelerate the implementation of the mdgs. we appeal to all who have made financial commitments to africa for the achievement of the mdgs not to renege on those commitments. we would like to express our appreciation to those development partners that continue to stick to their 0.7 per cent official development assistance commitment despite their financial difficulties at the domestic level. we support the secretary-generals high-level panel of eminent persons to focus on the acceleration of the implementation of the mdgs, and would urge that much of its focus be on assisting africa in meeting all its targets. however, we wish to caution against prejudging the review outcome and prematurely setting in motion processes that would undermine the ideals of the mdgs. the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms should be at the centre of our collective desire to resolve international disputes by peaceful means. racism and racial discrimination continue to be an affront to the very basic founding principles of the united nations and must be fought relentlessly. we should shun any idea in any part of the world that seems to suggest that there is a superior race or human being on the basis of skin colour. the danger of such ideas is still fresh in our collective memory. we have learned from the evils of colonialism, two world wars and the system of apartheid. we should all renew our commitment to continue to build on the solid foundation laid by the durban declaration and the plan of action that we adopted more than a decade ago at the end of the world conference against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. in durban last december, south africa had the honour of hosting the seventeenth session of the conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change and the seventh session of the conference of the parties serving as the meeting of the parties to the kyoto protocol. member states must ensure that agreements are implemented. in that regard, the durban platform offers an opportunity for progress that we must utilize to move forward. todays timely debate is a reminder that, ultimately, peace is a choice. peace is achievable. the wise and brave choices we have the power to make can deliver lasting peace to every corner of the world. we are called upon at this sixty-seventh session of the general assembly to choose peace by reforming and strengthening the united nations so that it can play its rightful role and deliver peace, security, sustainable development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world. as the foremost multilateral forum bringing together all nations of the world, the united nations is best placed to play this role. it requires our support as member states at all times, both for our sake and for that of future generations.",South

GAB,67,2012,"i warmly congratulate the president on his election as president of the general assembly at its sixty-seventh session. his election demonstrates the esteem in which he and his country, serbia, are held on the international scene. i can assure him that he has the support of my country, gabon. i also commend the outstanding work done by his predecessor, mr. nassir abdulaziz al-nasser, during his presidency of the assembly at its sixty-sixth session. and i would like to reiterate our confidence in the efforts that secretary-general ban ki-moon is undertaking as the head of the organization. our world more than ever needs a dialogue of civilizations and cultures. in order to build a more peaceful world, it needs more tolerance, more understanding and more respect among peoples. during this session, we are called upon to redefine the outlines for better management of global challenges. i would like to welcome the theme chosen by the president for this session, namely, bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means, which will remain at the heart of our common efforts and is indeed an ongoing quest. the debate we held yesterday on the rule of law at the national and international levels was also a discussion of the conditions for peace in our countries and around the world. by maintaining our focus on that goal and working together, we can better tackle the challenges of an international context that is still marked by multifaceted crises, illustrated by many hotbeds of tension around the world. that is shown by the situations in the middle east and africa, which are still of concern to us. the syrian crisis, which arose as an extension of the arab spring last year, is having a destabilizing impact on several countries of the middle east region. we hope that the efforts undertaken by the joint special representative, mr. lakhdar brahimi, will help put a stop to confrontation and will open up a dialogue. with respect to the situation in mali, we condemn the attempts to divide the country and the destruction of the world heritage sites in timbuktu. gabon supports the efforts of the new transitional government, the economic community of west african states and the african union to try to re-establish territorial integrity. i urge the security council and member states to support the united nations integral regional strategy on the sahel, which addresses issues of security, governance, development, human rights and humanitarian concerns. when we served on the security council, we joined other members in responding to the appeals of the libyan people. the situation there is still dire, and we encourage the united nations to continue to work to promote political stability and reconstruction efforts. we reiterate our condemnation of the attack on the united states consulate in benghazi. with regard to the ongoing tensions in the eastern part of our brother country the democratic republic of the congo, our collective support for the congolese state must be maintained in security, political and humanitarian matters. i welcome the progress made in somalia with the adoption of its provisional constitution and the election of the new president, hassan sheikh mohamud, whom i congratulate and commend. gabon will continue to help somalia, as it did last year with humanitarian contributions. i commend united nations and african union involvement in somalia. thanks to the african union mission in somalia and to government forces, security is improving even far outside mogadishu. i have the highest praise for the country, whose troops pay a heavy price on the ground. i honour the memory of the first prime minister of ethiopia, meles zenawi, who passed away on 22 august. all of us know of his work for peace in somalia and the sudan, his commendable tenures as chair of the new partnership for africas development heads of state and government orientation committee and his focus on climate change. it goes without saying that the crises and conflicts that continue to ravage the world constitute a profound betrayal of the cry-from-the-heart aspirations of all peoples for peace and security, justice, development and the equal sovereignty of states. those cries come from the people of palestine and cuba, who long for a better future. one wants recognition of a state living in peace and security with its neighbours, within secure, internationally recognized borders, while the other wants an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo it suffers under. the general assembly has many times spoken out on the side of those two peoples aspirations, through numerous resolutions, which my country has unequivocally supported. to fulfil the aspirations of all peoples, we need global governance that is more balanced, more democratic, better structured and based on the principles of the charter of the united nations. such governance must be founded on the primacy of international law and respect for the sovereignty of states in their quest for democracy and development. throughout the coming sixty-seventh session we will focus on certain priority issues, starting with various reforms of the organization, especially the revitalization of the general assembly, to make it better able to play its part given the changes and current realities in the world. we must strengthen the assemblys role as an active force and as the premier forum for global democracy. likewise, in its commitment to security council reform, gabon continues to support permanent and equitable representation for africa. as we did during our recent tenure on the council, we will continue our focus on mediation, prevention and the peaceful resolution of disputes and conflicts. we believe action must be taken before disputes escalate into armed conflict, sparing the heavy expense of peacekeeping operations. but current realities force us to focus also on new, cross-cutting threats to peace and security, including trafficking in small arms and light weapons and maritime piracy, which is ravaging the gulf of guinea. that is why we are working along with other countries in central africa to put in place confidence-building measures, including the early warning mechanism for central africa. we greatly appreciate the support offered by the united nations regional office for central africa, which my country hosts, in promoting peace. during my tenure as acting chairman of the economic community of west african states, i will emphasize regional integration as a means to common economic development and strengthening peaceful connections among member states. we know that the conflicts shaking the world have numerous and complex causes. any lasting settlement of those crises requires an approach that combines support for institution-building and governance in the affected countries with initiatives to revitalize their economies. gabon will therefore follow with great interest the issue of an increased role for the economic and social council. many countries remain concerned with economic conditions. we must therefore rethink our approaches to sustainable development initiatives. we must reflect clearly on the post-2015 development agenda, especially on how to coordinate the millennium development goals and the sustainable development goals enunciated in the outcome of the united nations conference on sustainable development (rio+20) (resolution 66/288). it is also crucial to break the impasse in the world trade organization by rethinking the basis for negotiations. we will thereby be better able to promote the tripartite model of aid together with investment and trade towards sustainable development. during last years session i referred to work in progress in my country towards the goal we set for ourselves to become an emerging country by 2025. since then that initiative has begun to produce results in the creation of strategic infrastructures, strengthening the rule of law and social, political and economic reforms. we continue to take steps to diversify our economy through local promotion of the natural resources we export, which encourages wealth creation and employment. those efforts must be based on sustainable management of our forests and their biodiversity, which plays an important role in the global environment. in that vein we are fighting poaching and the illegal trafficking in protected species. i am also pleased at the adoption, on 21 june, of the outcome of the rio+20 conference, which reflects the international communitys recognition of the need to work together to promote sustainable development through the joint efforts of individuals, governments, civil society and the private sector. along those lines i have instructed my government to rethink our countrys institutional framework for sustainable development, with an eye to enacting legislation on the subject. gabon is also pursuing the opportunities offered by a green economy in eradicating poverty. we are also continuing to develop our human resources, our financial services capabilities, new information technologies and ecotourism. given current economic challenges, i recently instituted measures to improve the daily lives of my fellow citizens by tackling the cost of living for instance, by suspending customs duties and the value added-tax on several basic items and building materials. in the social arena, we have put in place a national system of health coverage for all strata of gabonese society. that coverage, which is part of our fight against hiv/aids, includes free antiretrovirals and prenatal and maternal care for all infected pregnant women. at the political level, we have introduced biometrics to improve the organization of the next elections. we continue our efforts to talk with all leading players in the nation, in particular through the national council for democracy. together, those actions strengthen the climate of peace bequeathed to us by my illustrious predecessor, thereby creating an environment conducive to the well- being of citizens and to the security of investments needed for the development of the country. we are therefore ready to welcome diversified and mutually beneficial partnerships and look forward to doing so. our countries and the international community as a whole must today overcome considerable challenges. our efforts can fulfil the aspirations of our peoples only if we cooperate to achieve global governance based on respect for the rule of law, dialogue among peoples, conflict prevention, protection of the environment and biodiversity. our ultimate goal must be, above all, the well-being of our peoples. it is in that spirit that my country will continue to make its contribution both in our organization and in our common work for peace, security, development and prosperity for all.",Gabon,Africa,82.2837982177734,3.013400077819824,1703.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,2.3487962419260127
BEN,67,2012,"on behalf of the african continent and as chair of the african union, i would like to congratulate you, mr. president, on your election to the presidency of the general assembly at its sixty-seventh session, and at the same time congratulate the secretary-general for his leadership role for the peace and prosperity of our people. in our world, shaken by so many multifaceted crises, the assemblys general debate offers us the opportunity to transcend our national interests to contemplate together the ways and means to ensure international peace and security and to improve global governance for healthy economic growth, which is the guarantor of sustainable human development. in that regard, i welcome the relevance of the theme of this session, on the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means. it is a logical follow-up to that of the previous session, which focused on mediation in the settlement of disputes, and amply demonstrates the importance that the united nations accords to international peace and security, the foundation of a better world characterized by stability, equity, solidarity among nations, justice, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and international cooperation. with regard to the conflicts and other wars that shake our world, the african continent faces many challenges which it cannot straighten out by itself. we hope that the general assemblys attention, focused since its previous session on the thorny question of conflicts and how to settle them peacefully, will help africa to find appropriate solutions so that it can dedicate its resources and energies to the sustainable development of its states and to the well-being of its populations. the major constraints on africas economic development and social progress are at once sundry and variable. they include, inter alia, the illicit and massive circulation of small arms and light weapons, which feeds chronic insecurity and transnational organized crime in states and regions of the continent heretofore havens of peace and prosperity. there is an upsurge in terrorist acts in the sahelo-saharan area and activities related to transnational crime, such as abductions and illegal trafficking of all kinds, in particular of humans, and trafficking in narcotics and counterfeit medications. piracy and armed robbery at sea confront the states of the gulf of guinea and the horn of africa. we see ongoing unemployment and underemployment, lack of food in some regions and chronic malnutrition in many countries. soil degradation and erosion increase, and natural disasters, the consequences of climate upheavals and change recur. poor governance in international economic relations engenders an economic and financial crisis. in spite of the difficulties and shortfalls noted in their operation, the different elections that have taken place in many african states in 2011 and 2012 show the determination of the african peoples and their adherence to the process of implanting democracy and the rule of law in our dear continent. i take this opportunity to focus particularly on the efforts underway in the economic community of west african states (ecowas), supported by the african union, to deal with the grave security and institutional crises that have taken place in particular in mali and guinea-bissau. in mali a very disturbing situation is developing which has to do with the occupation of the north of the country by terrorist cells that threaten to destabilize the entire west african subregion and could threaten security on the continent and throughout the world. the terrorist cells share the same intolerance that is destabilizing the democratic government of the federal republic of nigeria. the international community has a duty to act decisively against that terrorist and fundamentalist threat and ensure that human rights are respected. i would like to reiterate from this rostrum my pressing appeal for the international community to commit itself, along with ecowas and the african union, to eliminate that serious threat to peace and security in the subregion and to prevent large-scale humanitarian disasters. i am not forgetting the situation in guinea-bissau, which continues to hold the attention of ecowas and of the african union in spite of progress made through mediation between the different the parties concerned, including ecowas, the african union, the community of portuguese-speaking countries, the united nations and the bilateral and multilateral partners. i hope that the initiatives will continue to help to bring about a coordinated approach to the crisis in order to reach an international and national consensus on the situation in that country. i welcome the different efforts by the african union and the international community in pursuit of peace with regard to the various other hotbeds of tension on the continent, namely, in the democratic republic of the congo, somalia, the sudan, south sudan, madagascar, et cetera. we must strengthen the strategic partnership established between the united nations security council and the peace and security council of the african union with regard to conflict prevention, mediation, peacekeeping, peacebuilding and the promotion of human rights and humanitarian law for the certain benefit of our people. we must also think more deeply on ways to ensure predictable and sustainable financing for african union peacekeeping operations, including the african standby force. as shown by the crises that are shaking our planet, the system of global governance that has prevailed up to now is suffering from serious disfunctions. it is therefore high time to accelerate the process of reforming the international system in order to democratize the mode of operation of its institutions and mechanisms that regulate and promote cooperation among states. since the 2005 world summit, various measures having to do with rationalizing the united nations system have been taken and have resulted in particular in the establishment of new bodies that have proven very useful. the peacebuilding commission, created to break the cycle of violence in countries emerging from conflict, has contributed to their stabilization by providing them targeted support to confront troubling situations. similarly, the human rights council is contributing to improving global governance with regard to the protection and promotion of human rights, humanitarian law and fundamental freedoms. in the same spirit, negotiations to reform the security council must be intensified to achieve in the near term the establishment of an inclusive council, one that would repair the historical injustice done to africa with respect to its presence in that organ, which heads the collective security system established by the charter of the united nations. completing security council reform would, i am sure, result in more serenity in the handling of the worlds current major problems in the area of international peace and security. it would confer greater legitimacy upon the actions of our common organization and would allow it to renew its original vocation as an instrument of conflict prevention and resolution. it would also allow it to shed the inconsistencies that limit it to the incongruous role of an observer of carnage taking place before its very eyes. those laudable reforms must be complemented by a system offering the youth and women an opportunity to get more involved in the life of the united nations. peace in the world is possible. we cannot ignore the situation in the middle east. today the united nations has the means to find a fair and sustainable solution to the palestinian problem, and under no pretext should it shirk its duty and historical responsibility. we are talking about security, stability and peace, not only in the middle east, but for the entire world. africa is fully in favour of the one land, two states solution to restore lasting peace in the middle east, because in the end the two peoples palestinians and israelis must be able to live in love, friendship, peace and prosperity. as the assembly knows, the world economy still suffers from the financial and economic crisis that was unleashed in 2008. in spite of the macroeconomic policies established by both developed and developing countries, with the support of the national and international financial institutions, the economic slowdown that began in 2008 has persisted, with the corollary of weak and fragile economic growth and more than 75 million unemployed people throughout the world, with very high unemployment rates in the developing countries. the prices of raw materials, which are the major source of export earnings for developing countries, have become very volatile, as have the prices of food commodities. flows of private capital meant for foreign direct investment cannot escape the negative impact of the crisis. at the same time, we see a tangible reduction of aid for development and other forms of official f lows from countries of the north to those of the south. with regard to food security, almost 16 million people in sahel countries face problems of famine and nutrition, in spite of the many efforts made individually by our states and the collective initiatives in the african union through the new partnership for africas development and through the comprehensive africa agriculture development programme. in fact, of 40 countries facing a food shortage throughout the world, 34 still are in africa, even though about twenty of them have allocated at least 20 per cent of their budget to agriculture. that is why the nineteenth ordinary session of the assembly of heads of state and government of the african union adopted a decision declaring 2014 the year of agriculture and food security in africa to mark the tenth anniversary of the comprehensive africa agriculture development programme. the forecasted increase in food commodity prices, according to recent estimates of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations, and the already high costs of energy are certainly additional burdens for already vulnerable populations. we also welcome the positive initiative of the new alliance for food security and nutrition taken by president barack obama on the margins of the group of eight summit, held on 18 and 19 may at camp david, which calls for bringing together donors, partner countries and the private sector for a common cause aimed at pulling 50 million people out of poverty in the next ten years. we hope that this will allow us to mobilize more assistance for african countries in order to improve food security and nutrition in order to accelerate their progress towards achieving the millenium development goals. it is also important not to disappoint the hopes raised by the conclusions of the united nations conference on sustainable development (rio+20), which adopted more than 700 official commitments and promises of gifts totaling more than $500 billion. the impact of those conferences will be measured by the fulfilment of the decisions and commitments. africa hopes that the results of the work of the high-level group of eminent persons selected by the secretary-general to advise him on the post-2015 development programme and the working group to define sustainable development goals will be able to achieve convergence in their efforts to suggest a vision of sustainable human development, capable of mobilizing the international community so as to achieve equity and attain a prosperity shared by all. africa, the cradle of humankind, is also a continent of the future, of hope and hopefulness. indeed, thanks to the incalculable potential of its subsoil and to the youthfulness of its population which in 2050 will number 2 billion, 60 per cent of whom will be less than 35 years old africa could become the driving force for growth of the global economy, if that youth becomes professionalized. that is why we raised to cardinal principles the values of unity, stability, peace, security, good governance and the struggle against any impediments to our development, particularly corruption, impuntiy, the loss of accountability, fratricidal wars, political and institutional instability and brutal challenges to the constitutional order. we have affirmed all of those values through the african charter on democracy, elections and governance, the african charter on public service and the african peace and security mechanisms, et cetera. africa has decided to establish a free trade zone throughout the continent and is in the process of accelerating its economic integration through its ambitious programme of developing infrastructure namely, energy, railroad networks, airports and ports. that feeds the hope that we will have support for private-public partnerships to finance those wide-ranging infrastructure programmes. in our implacable fight against poverty, africa has no choice but to persevere in its efforts to ensure progress in the areas of food, nutrition, health, water provisioning, sanitation, primary, technical and professional education for all, and the independence of women and children. the fight against hiv/aids, tuberculosis and malaria is a top priority for the continent, and we will not be idle as long as we have not achieved the objectives that we set in abuja. in that regard, we welcome the decision adopted by the assembly of heads of state and government of the african union asking the commission of the union to develop a road map for the african union for shared responsibility and global solidarity in combating hiv/aids, tuberculosis and malaria in africa for the period of 2012 to 2015. a high-level coordinating meeting on the subject will take place tomorrow, 26 september 2012, at united nations headquarters. i call on the spirit of solidarity of developed countries and of countries of the south that are experiencing considerable economic expansion to set up, according to their historic responsibility and their abilities, opportunities to assist the efforts of african countries, as was agreed during the fourth ministerial conference of the least developed countries, held in istanbul, turkey in may 2011, as well as at the group of 20 summit in los cabos, mexico, in june. the recommendations of those bodies reflect well our common ambition to transition of half of the least developed countries to the category of middle-income countries by 2020 an ambition that has been fully integrated into the rio+20 vision. my fervent wish is that the current difficulties of development partners of the north, due to the sovereign debt and bank crises, and the austerity measures that they are rightly imposing on themselves do not def lect them from their commitments to a significant increase in development aid. in that regard, i am pleased by the reaffirmation at the rio+20 conference on sustainable development of the resolve of heads of state and government to spare no effort to more promptly achieve internationally agreed development goals, including attaining the millennium development goals by 2015, while bearing in mind the concerns linked to the risks that current production and consumption methods pose to the planet in terms of the accelerated depletion of resources and the challenges for future generations. i am convinced that a new world is possible. it presupposes inclusive governance in international political, financial and economic bodies. moreover, the continuing challenges facing humanity make us fully aware of our interdependence and the need for an agreed system of governance in managing international relations rather than withdrawal and resort to unilateralism and coercive domination. i remain convinced that a new world characterized by peace, stability, security and the shared prosperity of our planet and our peoples will emerge only by the international community sharing its technology and financial resources, together with the wealth of the african continent. may god bless our planet.",Benin,Africa,32.9488182067871,3.562020063400269,2516.0,9.0,0.0,9.0,3.577106518282989
STP,67,2012,"first of all, on behalf of the government of sao tome and principe, and in my own name, i would like to congratulate vuk jeremic on his election as president of the general assembly at its sixty-seventh session. i am convinced that his experience as minister for foreign affairs of the republic of serbia will be a most positive contribution to strengthening the affirmation of the principles of the united nations charter for world security and peace, and i trust that he will lead the work of this session with clarity and balance. the democratic republic of sao tome and principe also wishes to express its great appreciation for the work of secretary-general ban ki-moon and for his role in expanding our organization and encouraging it to continue its efforts to achieve the objectives of world peace and security. i would also like to take this opportunity to thank ambassador nassir abdulaziz al-nasser for his highly positive contribution during the sixty-sixth session. as it did during the debates of the sixty-sixth session of the general assembly, the democratic republic of sao tome and principe reiterates its hope that the united nations will play a key role in mediating international conflicts. unfortunately, today we continue to look on with concern as conflicts that could jeopardize international peace and security persist and further exacerbate the deep economic and financial crisis that is devastating the world. sadly, our organization continues to suffer from roadblocks that prevent urgent decisions from being taken and that undermine this forums credibility. that inaction translates into impunity for leaders who martyrize their own peoples, paving the way for more international disorder, despair and the sentiment of injustice that is experienced when peoples receive unequal treatment. we need no further evidence of the urgency for in-depth reforms of our organization, primarily the security council, than our inability to put an end to the horrific images of children, symbols of purity and innocence, who are killed daily in syria, to prevent the destruction of the worlds historic and cultural heritage, as by gangs of destructive criminals in mali and in afghanistan, and to forestall coups detat or obvious attempts to destabilize states and democratically elected governments that in fact solve nothing and irreparably delay the lengthy process of building democracy and fighting poverty. we must prevent the disintegration of territories and remedy the abnormal and degrading situations of peoples who have already suffered from the poverty and exclusion created by a lack of democratic leadership or of effective and democratic rule of law. in the specific case of the republic of guinea-bissau, with which sao tome and principe maintains deeply rooted historic, cultural and linguistic links, the international community should bring both firmness and persistence to bear in finding a credible, inclusive and lasting solution that will ensure that coups detat do not recur in that country. to do so necessarily requires a reform of the armed forces as well as a strong warning to the political class as a whole to make a steadfast commitment to respect political dialogue and democratic legality. on our side, we will continue to make efforts, in cooperation with the community of portuguese-speaking countries and other engaged regional and international organizations, to guarantee a better future for the people of guinea-bissau. regarding the occupation of the north of the republic of mali by groups of terrorists and the persistent conflict in the democratic republic of the congo, sao tome and principe acknowledges and applauds the efforts the international community has made through the united nations and the african union to establish peace, security and stability. however, it seems that it is becoming increasingly essential for us to ask the states that share borders with those two african countries to establish more effective, intelligent and effective ways to cooperate, based on trust and on a matrix of mutually beneficial and realistic economic interests. it is common knowledge that the forces of destabilization, despair and terror are fuelled and furthered by differences and distrust between states, which in turn paralyses the international decision-making process. however, we must point out positive signs in the trends of a few conflicts on the african continent, such as the cases of the republics of the sudan, south sudan and somalia. consequently, we cannot fail to applaud the recent agreement signed by the republic of the sudan and south sudan. through that framework, the two countries will be able to live in peace and harmony. we also welcome the positive role of the african union mission in somalia, which paves the way to returning the political, economic and social situation of that country and the region to normalcy. moreover, in our opinion, the important recommendations of the secretary-generals report on the situation concerning the western sahara (s/2012/197) are a positive asset for a permanent resolution. the social movements that took place in north africa in 2011, which had the merit of reinstating the right to freedom and democracy for the different peoples, were popular movements that in many cases were mobilized through social networking and modern instruments of technical communication. various situations of insecurity and reprehensible acts, as well as the acts recently committed in benghazi of which american diplomats were the victims, raise the issue of how we may live in this new context of the circulation and dissemination of images and information at the global level, in a world that we want to be free, open and tolerant, but in which large segments of the world population still live in a state of extreme poverty, with no access to education and with the growing conviction that they face exclusion and discrimination. how do we deal with the offences committed by people, including even some persons with public political responsibilities such as state leaders, who fail to recognize the right of other peoples and states to exist? in that regard, we would like to take the opportunity that this platform affords us to express to the mourning families of diplomats, journalists, members of non-governmental organization and peacekeepers our sincere and deep condolences as well as our unfailing solidarity. our ongoing obligation to work to build a better world and to invest in education and the promotion of human and democratic values is fundamental, beginning with member states complying with all united nations resolutions. the massacres in syria must cease, the integrity and security of the state of israel must be effectively guaranteed, the palestinian people must have their own state, the embargo against cuba must end, countries, including iran, must have the right to civil nuclear technology and must scrupulously observe the commitments that that entails, and polluters must be the principal payers. it must be our ambition, and not a mere hope, to ensure that we return here next year with an agenda that includes fewer of these troublesome issues, many of which are recurring. we are pleased to note a few positive signs in the dialogue between the republic of china on taiwan and the peoples republic of china on the one hand, and, on the other, the willingness of the united states congress and the european parliament to admit taiwan as a member of international organizations. sao tome and principe supports initiatives such as these, which will make it possible for the people of taiwan to make a significant contribution to international issues without ignoring the necessity for the two parties in the straits of formosa to work peacefully to agree to frame and normalize their relations. the high-level meeting that preceded the general debate was an excellent opportunity for member states to share information on how democratic reforms are being implemented and the rule of law strengthened both in individual countries and at the international level. it is very pleasing that this discussion is leading to significant progress in implementing the democratic and institutional reforms that can help to strengthen the rule of law, internally and internationally. in that regard, sao tome and principe congratulates the republic of angola on its recent successful and transparent general elections, since they also constitute another step towards strengthening the democratic process in its sister country of sao tome and principe. threats to our global security, particularly transnational crimes such as piracy and the trafficking and sale of arms and drugs, are a matter of great concern for sao tome and principe, a country with a long coastline located in the gulf of guinea. such events are threats that we cannot ignore; they demand that we cooperate as closely as possible both with the states we share the coastline with and the other partners and organizations that have experience in dealing with such issues, and adopt mechanisms which we resolve to strengthen for preventing, managing and resolving conflicts caused by organized crime in order to improve our collective security. in that context, we applaud the important resolutions 2018 (2011) and 2039 (2012) adopted by the security council on maritime safety and security in the gulf of guinea. as part of the gulf of guinea region, we repeat our firm pledge to do everything we can, jointly with our partners, to prevent that region, rich as it is in raw materials of strategic importance to industrialized economies, from becoming a stage for maritime piracy and other scourges that hinder economic trade, peace and security in the region. to that end, we reiterate that we are absolutely ready and willing to help implement initiatives to hold an international summit on maritime piracy in the gulf of guinea. the substantial transformations that have occurred in the international political arena as a result of the grave global financial crisis have forced the citizens of small states, and of sao tome and principe in particular, to make major sacrifices. in that regard, sao tome and principe believes that the continuing international and economic financial crisis and its effects on the economies of small countries, which have included reductions and slowdowns in official international aid, tend to threaten social cohesion as well as previous improvements in fiscal discipline, the business climate and political stability itself. the acceptability of controlling and reducing public deficits in developing countries such as ours is reaching its limits where our citizens are concerned, and good governance now demands measures that can effectively jump-start our economies through productive investments. we believe that the most vulnerable populations, in both the northern and southern hemispheres of our planet, are demanding changes in the practices and rules of the international financial system, and new world financial governance that is better able to hold accountable the financial stakeholders and speculators who undermine the efforts of governments and their peoples to develop economies that bring progress. internally, the government of the democratic republic of sao tome and principe is making efforts to reduce poverty and increase transparency in public management and economic growth. institutional reforms in the areas of public finance, justice and national defence, whose purpose is to strengthen the capacities of our democratic institutions and develop the country, have been progressing at a good pace. regarding the millennium development goals, for which the united nations has set a deadline of 2015, the democratic republic of sao tome and principe can report significant progress, particularly in the areas of education, with a literacy rate of 92 per cent of the population, and health, especially in the fight against malaria. however, we realize that meeting the deadline will require further effort. to achieve those goals, our country hopes to continue to receive support in many forms from the international community. in that regard, i would like to take this opportunity to extend the sincere thanks of the democratic republic of sao tome and principe to the entire international community, and in particular unesco and all of its member states, for designating the island of principe a unesco world biosphere reserve, thus recognizing and providing further incentives for our efforts to defend and preserve the environment. i would like to conclude by repeating that the government of sao tome and principe, which i have the honour of representing, stands ready and willing to take part in efforts to mobilize the will and synergy needed to achieve the honourable goals that guided the creation of the united nations.",Sao Tome and Principe,Africa,90.1430969238281,6.928460121154785,2039.0,7.0,0.0,7.0,3.4330554193231975
MRT,68,2013,"i am particularly pleased to present our warmest congratulations to the president on the occasion of his election to preside over the general assembly at its sixty-eighth session. i am convinced that he will spare no effort to strengthen the gains made and to firmly establish international peace and security, so as to create an international system in which all of mankind enjoys well-being, stability and progress. the presidents experience and political skills in heading his countrys mission for over a decade are also factors that make him a natural leader during this session. i should also like to praise the efforts of his predecessor, mr. vuk jeremi., and commend him for his interest in the problems of the african continent and his efforts to strengthen the principle of dialogue as an effective tool for consultation and the role of the rule of law and good governance. i would also like to thank the secretary-general, mr. ban ki-moon, for his unflagging efforts in the service of international peace and security and his focus on climate change issues and the fight against famine and deadly diseases, as well as on realizing the millennium development goals. last june, in the important speech that the president delivered to the general assembly on the occasion of his election to preside over the sixty-eighth session (see a/67/pv.87), he outlined his ambitious programme of action, which takes into account the participation of women, youth and civil society in the post-2015 development agenda, the role of south- south cooperation, the role of human rights and the rule of law, and the role of information technology and communication in the proposed development agenda. those are important topics, and we thank him for including them. over the past two decades in step with the human development report some developing countries have experienced substantial economic change. however, the majority of developing countries, especially the least developed ones, remain very far from achieving the millennium development goals. on the threshold of 2015, it behoves us today to implement plans and programmes that take into consideration the failures of the past and the challenges of the future and to effectively prepare the post-2015 development agenda. in that regard, we call upon the wealthy countries of the world to live up to their promises regarding the financing of development programmes in those developing countries that have such pressing needs. we also call upon those countries to implement an appropriate policy, under the supervision of the united nations specialized agencies and in cooperation with the international financial institutions, that will be based primarily on the following: support for health and education systems; debt forgiveness; the transfer of the necessary technology; the improvement of north-south trade; the removal of customs duties on exports from the developing countries, especially the least developed countries, to the markets of the north; the promotion of south-south cooperation, which will probably strengthen economic cooperation between group members; the establishment of new international mechanisms that will be charged with overseeing regional complementarity, strengthening south-south relations, as underscored in the aforementioned human development report, which will facilitate the sharing of know-how, lessons learned and technology transfer between those countries. under the leadership of the president of the republic, mr. mohamed ould abdel aziz, our government is working to improve the standard of living of our citizens, despite our limited resources. in order to attain that objective, the government has pursued a rigorous educational policy, based on compulsory and widespread primary education and the strengthening of a modern secondary education with free higher education in several different fields. basic schooling is now available in almost all of our villages and cities. that was made possible thanks to the government policy of limiting anarchic urbanization by merging numerous villages. with regard to secondary education, all the departments throughout the country now have middle schools and many have high schools. that has allowed the children of people living in remote villages to continue their secondary schooling. high schools reserved for the most promising students were also established to take advantage of their talents and steer them towards specializations that meet the needs of the labour market. higher education took a large qualitative step forward. a university campus has just been completed in nouakchott. an islamic studies university has been opened in the interior of the country, as well as four specialized schools of higher education, including the school of mines, the polytechnic, the school of agricultural training and public works. the faculty of medicine has been strengthened and endowed with the means necessary to cover the shortfall in medical personnel in our country, in addition to the creation of four medical schools to train nurses and senior technicians. health, which goes in line with education, is a major challenge for developing countries and the african continent in particular. given that, our government has allocated an important percentage of its budget for that vital sector and has created national programmes to fight against such deadly diseases as aids, malaria and tuberculosis. in that connection, we have created four new fully equipped hospitals in various parts of the country, in addition to 70 primary-care clinics. we must also note the construction of a specialized oncology hospital, which is considered to be among the most sophisticated in the region. the health-care sector also works closely with united nations specialized agencies in organizing ongoing vaccination campaigns for children under 5 years of age. as with most developing countries, our country depends on imports of basic goods from the global market, which weighs heavily on our balance sheets, especially since the prices of such products are subject to fluctuations in the world market. aware of that, our government has pursued an economic and financial policy that would alleviate the effects generated from outside. our agricultural sector has therefore been able, thanks to the policy, to fulfil 60 per cent of the countrys rice needs and 37 per cent of its need for other grains. wheat crops, which were recently introduced, have begun to produce. in that context, a sugar-cane cultivation project was launched to make sugar available locally. generally, our government has worked tirelessly in all sectors to ensure that its citizens can live in dignity. a free-trade zone has been created in nouadhibou the economic capital of the country and the third-largest city in population which will transform the region into an important economic centre benefiting the country and the region as a whole. in order to strengthen good governance and the fight against corruption, the inspector general and the court of auditors have been revitalized since president mohamed ould abdel aziz took office. significant funds in some sectors have been poorly managed, but have been reimbursed to the state. civil servants have been made accountable for the poor allocation of certain resources. agreements were reached to end the no-bid contract system. the lack of competitive bidding has undermined equity among the various economic drivers of national and international markets. transparency now prevails in the recruitment of civil servants thanks to competitive examinations fostering equality among men and women and providing hope to young people. merit- based candidate selection is now possible, leading to an end to nepotism and favouritism. the governments austerity policy, including its reduced administrative budget and increased investment budget, has contributed to the self-financing of the majority of the countrys development projects. the policy has also led to reduced unemployment, which now hovers around 10 per cent. the policies have also contributed to an increased growth rate, which should attain, according to current forecasts, more than 6 per cent by the end of the year. we have also been preparing for municipal and legislative elections slated for the end of the year. that will strengthen good governance and allow our citizens to participate in the process of defining the countrys future, and setting political and economic priorities for our country. our foreign policy is solidly based on a concern for strengthening good-neighbourly relations and non-interference in the internal affairs of states. we will work with our maghreb region arab and african with a sense of duty towards international relations and issues so as to disseminate a culture of peace, encourage dialogue and the resort to wisdom, and facilitate the role of diplomacy as a means of resolving conflicts and avoiding or ending war. president mohamed ould abdel aziz, who has not wavered in exerting his utmost efforts, as the head of the african union peace and security council, to find solutions to certain conflicts in the african continent, including in cote divoire, libya and mali. he has played a very important role, through his presence at subregional and international summits, focusing on peace and security around the world. for a number of years, the african sahel region has been subjected to all types of cross-border organized crime, including drug trafficking, arms trafficking, illegal immigration and kidnapping. we reiterate our call to the international community to support the states of the region in tackling those dangers, which have recently threatened the very existence of a states members of the united nations. that clearly shows that the states of the sahel cannot tackle the scourge on their own. based on its sense of duty, the islamic republic of mauritania, which has stood by mali since the beginning of the crisis, quickly opened its borders to our malian brothers and sisters who were seeking refuge in our territory. we have provided and continue to provide shelter for those individuals. our capital, nouakchott, over many months hosted a series of negotiations between the malian provisional authorities and the azawad groups, which led to the signing of the ougadougou accords, thus facilitating the preparations for the presidential elections. we take this opportunity to express our sincere congratulations to the people of the sister nation of mali and the hope that the changes will lead to a new era of well-being, security and progress. our country strongly condemns the horrific terrorist attack on the kenyan capital, nairobi, which cost the lives of dozens of individuals. for more than two years, certain countries of the arab region have experienced instability owing to the so-called arab spring. our country, respectful of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, expresses its full solidarity with the peoples of those countries. with deep concern and worry, we are following the most recent developments in the syrian arab republic. we invite all stakeholders to refrain from violence and any escalation of violence and, instead, to follow the logic of dialogue, aimed at finding a peaceful solution so as to spare the brotherly syrian people from suffering and tragedy. at the same time, with respect to the preservation, territorial integrity and sovereignty of the syrian territory, it is our hope that the mission of mr. lakhdar brahimi, joint special representative of the united nations and the league of arab states on the syrian crisis, will achieve success. it is our firm hope that a swift solution can be found that will bring an end to the bloodshed, destruction of infrastructure and economic devastation in sisterly syria. we hope that the people of egypt, yemen, libya and tunisia can quickly conclude their transition periods and build democratic institutions that will guarantee the rights and dignity of their citizens in an atmosphere of well-being and prosperity. our country pays close attention to the situation in western sahara. we reaffirm our support for the endeavours of the secretary-general and his personal envoy in their search for a definitive, lasting, fair and comprehensive solution that is acceptable to both parties. such a solution would bolster peace and security in the region and facilitate the building of a prosperous arab maghreb that is in step with the legitimate aspirations of its people. the arab-israeli conflict is considered a source of hostility and a threat to peace and security in a vital and critical region of the world. it remains so in spite of the legal framework and general conditions for the settlement of that dispute that have been established over the years by a series of security council and general assembly resolutions. those foundations were recently further backed by the arab peace initiative based on the land-for-peace principle. in spite of all of that, the conflict continues, as it has done for too long. we welcome resolution 67/19, of 29 november 2012, whereby the general assembly granted palestine the status of non-member observer state in the united nations. we hope that that resolution will mark the beginning of a new era that will see justice done for the palestinian people and their rights restored through the establishment of their independent and sovereign sate along the 4 june 1967 borders, with east jerusalem as its capital. that would put an end to the suffering of the palestinian people, which dates back to the inception of our organization. based on the need to ensure justice, credibility and equity in the relations between the two parties to that conflict, and out of respect for the relevant resolutions and decisions under international law, the international community should live up to its historic responsibilities with regard to palestine. we reiterate our condemnation of the ongoing blockade against the gaza strip, and we condemn the massacres perpetrated by the israeli war machine against palestinian civilians and the destruction of their facilities. we welcome efforts, most recently by the united states administration, seeking the resumption of negotiations between the two parties. we hope that those efforts will contribute to the realization of the palestinian peoples simplest right: the establishment of their independent state. the commitments made by the international community through the united nations will go unrealized if the people of the world are unable to fulfil their potential for development, especially in developing countries, to live lives of dignity and freedom, and to enjoy justice and equality the very lofty principles for which our organization was created. these are the only guarantees of our success.",Mauritania,Africa,62.0687484741211,2.293540000915527,2330.0,25.0,0.0,25.0,10.729613733905579
BWA,68,2013,"allow me, on behalf of the botswana delegation, to join previous speakers in congratulating president ashe most sincerely on his assumption of the presidency of the assembly. his election demonstrates the confidence and high esteem in which he personally and his great country, antigua and barbuda, are held by the states members of the organization. we particularly admire his deep passion and proven record of leadership here at the united nations on issues of sustainable development and climate change. we are therefore confident that the vast knowledge and experience of multilateral diplomacy which he brings to this position will contribute significantly to the success of this session. may i also congratulate his predecessor, vuk jeremi., for his effective guidance and sterling leadership of the sixty- seventh session. my delegation fully endorses the theme he has proposed for this session, namely, the post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage, including overcoming poverty and insecurity as well as ensuring the achievement of the sustainable development goals. this is quite relevant and fitting given the fact that the international community is on the brink of two major interrelated developments in the global arena: the imminent target date of 2015 for the achievement of the millennium development goals (mdgs) and the evolution of the sustainable development goals, which will constitute a significant part of the post- 2015 development agenda. we therefore pledge our full support and cooperation to president ashe in his efforts to usher in a new development paradigm. there is no doubt that the challenges of extreme poverty, disease, lack of access to affordable energy, potable water and sanitation, climate change and gender inequality will continue to haunt millions of our people, especially in developing countries. it is on account of this that my delegation is of the strong view that the formulation of the sustainable development goals should be predicated on the outcome of the current review of the implementation of the millennium development goals. to that end, we believe that the sustainable development goals should complement the millennium development goals rather than replace them wholesale. botswana has made impressive achievements in the implementation of the millennium development goals, and we have mainstreamed them into our national development planning process. a substantial portion of our national budget is allocated to health, education, infrastructure, human resource development and the empowerment of women and young people. i am proud to report that we have achieved universal primary education, as well as universal access to hiv/aids treatment, care and support services. we have drastically reduced the mother-to-child transmission of hiv/aids. we are working tirelessly towards achieving zero new infections and zero hiv/aids-related deaths by 2015. we reaffirm our commitment to the fight against hiv/aids. central to our efforts is the commitment to ensuring respect for human rights and expanding access to prevention, treatment and care support services for affected populations, including those most at risk. in addition, we remain committed to providing a good quality of life for all of botswana. in that regard, we give the utmost priority to the implementation of poverty eradication programmes, with particular focus on vulnerable communities and vulnerable groups, such as women, youth, the elderly and persons with disabilities. despite all of the achievements we have made to date, serious challenges remain. permit me to briefly address the vexing subject of climate change and the situation of countries in special categories, including middle-income countries. botswana is among the sub-saharan african countries that suffer the most from the adverse impact of climate change. some of the notable manifestations of climate change are extreme temperatures, water shortages, land degradation, desertification and persistent drought. climate change also has adverse impacts on health and food security. while it is gratifying that progress continues to be made in many countries in the implementation of the united nations framework convention on climate change, my delegation believes that more needs to be done, particularly to assist vulnerable countries in arid and semi-arid areas and landlocked and transit countries, such as my own, that are also susceptible to drought and desertification. financial support, technology transfer and capacity-building need to be generously extended to that special category of countries in order to assist them in adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change. last year, botswana hosted the summit for sustainability in africa, whose outcome declaration calls upon governments to ensure that the contributions of natural capital to sustainable economic growth and the maintenance and improvement of social capital and human well-being are quantified and integrated into development and business practices. we wish to commend the work done by non-governmental environmental organizations worldwide in their unremitting efforts to save the planet from climate change and its negative effects. botswana welcomes the adoption earlier this year of the long-overdue arms trade treaty. the treaty establishes common international standards for the regulation of international trade in conventional arms, ammunition and parts and components, with a view to strengthening international peace and security. in that regard, i am delighted to report that arrangements are under way to facilitate our signing and ratification of that vital instrument in the very near future. botswana remains firmly committed to a strong and effective international criminal justice system hence our continued strong support for the mandate and work of the international criminal court. we believe that the court has a vital role to play in the fight against impunity, genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. in that regard, last april, botswana hosted a regional workshop for african states parties to the rome statute. the workshop was aimed at encouraging african states parties to ratify the 2010 kampala amendments to the rome statute, which deal with the specific question of the crime of aggression. i am pleased to say that, following the workshop, botswana became the first african state party to ratify the kampala amendments. we can only hope that other state parties will follow suit so that we can secure the requisite number of ratifications for the amendments to enter into force. turning now to issues of international peace and security, it defies logic that, throughout the course of history, humankind has unleashed untold suffering on humankind. conflict is raging in many parts of the world, where innocent lives are being lost needlessly. my delegation wishes to reiterate that states have a duty and a responsibility to protect their populations from war crimes and crimes against humanity and to see to it that the perpetrators of such crimes do not benefit from impunity. in situations where it is clear that states have failed or are unwilling to exercise their responsibility to protect, it is only fair and proper that the international community should intervene. in that regard, i refer mainly to the responsibility of the security council. for slightly over two years now, the people of syria have been engulfed in a brutal civil war whose end seems nowhere in sight. we remain deeply concerned that syria continues to be soaked in the blood of its citizens. we therefore wish to note our disappointment with those permanent members of the security council that continue to frustrate resolutions authorizing interventions seeking a lasting solution to the ongoing carnage in syria. it is a cause for extreme sadness that, despite the ever-worsening humanitarian situation in that country, the international community continues to turn a blind eye to the situation. we fear that, if the current state of affairs continues, a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions will unfold and haunt humankind for many generations to come. accordingly, we wish to reiterate our position that punitive action in some form should be taken against the al-assad regime for committing crimes against humanity. we appeal once again to the security council, the organ with responsibility under the charter of the united nations for the maintenance of international peace and security, to take decisive action, once and for all, to end the human suffering in syria. let me take this opportunity to commend all credible human rights and humanitarian organizations for their efforts to relieve human suffering around the world. we equally wish to commend those countries in the region, especially turkey, jordan and lebanon, for accommodating and positively responding to the plight of refugees from syria and trying to meet their needs. the political upheaval in egypt is also a cause for grave concern. naturally, we believe that former president morsi contributed to the present crisis by attempting to promulgate his undemocratic and divisive agenda, which resulted in an unfortunate military coup. urgent action is therefore required to restore constitutional rule in that country. we note with deep concern that, shortly after celebrating the second anniversary of its independence, africas newest sovereign state, south sudan, has experienced developments in its relations with the sudan that seriously threaten its security and territorial integrity. at the same time, we remain deeply concerned about the further deterioration of the political and humanitarian situation in darfur. we therefore appeal to the international community to assist in all ways possible to restore peace and stability in that region. my government strongly condemns the recent spate of terrorist attacks in kenya, nigeria and pakistan, which have resulted in the loss of many innocent lives. we wish to convey our sincere condolences and sympathy to the affected countries and the families of the deceased. those acts of terror are a threat to international peace and security and militate against the international communitys efforts to build a secure, peaceful and prosperous world. such terrorist acts are transnational in nature and call therefore for a global response. to that end, we appeal to the conscience and resolve of all members of the international community to remain united and steadfast, if we are to win that fight. there can be no doubt that, if left unchecked, international terrorism has the potential to undermine our global development agenda. we find it opportune to commend secretary- general ban ki-moon for the vanguard role he continues to play in the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as in addressing issues of human suffering across the globe. the secretary- general should also be applauded for his continued efforts to coordinate international efforts to advance the post-2015 development agenda. let me conclude by reaffirming botswanas continued commitment to playing its part in the quest for international peace and security as well as in the international communitys unrelenting efforts towards making the world a safer, peaceful and more prosperous place for both present and future generations.",Botswana,Africa,86.8231811523438,8.0172064061589,1748.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.7162471395881005
SEN,68,2013,"on behalf of the senegalese delegation, i would like to wish you, sir, all the best as president at the sixty-eighth session of the general assembly. by focusing its debate on the post-2015 development agenda, the general assembly reminds us that there is not much time left before attainment of the millennium development goals (mdgs) is finally evaluated. despite progress after more than a decade of implementing the mdgs, the magnitude of the challenges is still overwhelming. in terms of access to food, housing, education and healthcare, the daily lives of nearly one billion people have barely improved. women continue to die in childbirth. inequalities persist within and between countries. the economic crisis continues and environmental degradation is worsening. we need to take concrete and resolute actions to transform our collective ambitions into reality. in the quest for sustainable development, a conference on climate change in 2015 in paris will provides us with another opportunity to pull ourselves together, by reversing the negative effects of climate change on earth, our common habitat. addressing the challenges of sustainable development and building the future we want, in the spirit of the rio+20 conference, require a more sustained effort than the fight against poverty. we should invest more in education, as the global partnership for education expects of us. we need to modernize agriculture, make electricity accessible to everybody and develop infrastructure to foster trade and investment. these are the pillars that underpin growth and prosperity. it is precisely this vision that the new partnership for africas development (nepad) seeks to promote through its programme for infrastructure development in africa (pida). as part of that programme, 51 priority projects have been identified and established throughout the continent. overall, they will cost $68 billion between 2012 and 2020. as chairperson of nepads orientation committee, i am pleased with the consensus that our partners have built around pida, namely, the group of twenty and the group of eight (g-8) and with brazil, russia, india and china. i also welcome the very strong signal which the g-8, meeting in june in lough erne, sent concerning the need for a concerted campaign against tax evasion and other fraudulent practices affecting our economies. we must now push ahead and launch the mechanisms we have agreed on for improving transparency in international transactions, including the mining industry. this is the best way to support africas efforts to mobilize domestic resources in order to finance its development. similarly, senegal calls for the reform of international economic and financial governance, notably the terms for accessing credit and obtaining financing for economic and social development projects. let us not pave the road to the future with the instruments of the past. while plummeting official development assistance no longer meets africas needs, the trend towards progress should lead us to explore other innovative financing mechanisms available to our countries. africa is no longer a zone of turmoil and humanitarian emergencies. africa has become an emerging centre of opportunities and investments for innovative and mutually beneficial partnerships. the world has changed; africa has also changed. let us therefore change our paradigms and visions; let us change the way we look at the continent. change is also needed for the reform of the security council. the councils legitimacy is not derived only from its status as the guarantor of the collective security system; it is also and especially derived from the representativeness that justifies its action in the name of and on behalf of all member states. this time last year, mali was doubly affected by a coup and a terrorist attack reminiscent of a bygone age. they were a source of great concern for us. senegal, which remains active within united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali, welcomes the restoration of the territorial integrity and constitutional legality of mali. we congratulate the people of mali and their political leaders for that happy outcome. we strongly support the national reconciliation efforts being made by the government in the spirit of the ouagadougou political agreement. today, while the armed groups have been defeated, the terrorist threat to the sahel has not yet been definitively ended. it is only through ongoing, coordinated and sufficiently deterrent action that we will be able to address the emerging security challenges on the african continent. it is urgent to make operational the african rapid response force, proposed at the last african union summit. in guinea-bissau, senegal is supporting the governments efforts to successfully carry out the electoral process. we urge our partner countries and institutions to pursue their support for the definitive resolution of the guinea-bissau crisis through the countrys economic recovery, the crucial reform of the defence and security sector, and the fight against illicit drug trafficking. we hope that similar attention will be paid to the central african republic and to the democratic republic of the congo in the legitimate aspiration to peace, stability and the preservation of territorial integrity. throughout africa, we are committed to upholding respect for the african union principles against anti-constitutional changes of government, regardless of the process used. in regard to the middle east, senegal expresses its deep concern over the untold suffering of the syrian population. we urge the syrian government to exercise restraint and to comply with the chemical weapons convention in the control and destruction of its arsenal of chemical weapons. in its capacity as chairman of the committee on the exercise of the inalienable rights of the palestinian people, senegal is following the resumption of the israeli-palestinian peace negotiations. it is a courageous and responsible act because it translates the vision of two states, israel and palestine, living within secure and internationally recognized borders. we therefore call for a halt to acts likely to affect that perspective, notably the ongoing establishment of settlements on palestinian land by the israeli government. on 24 september, senegal joined other countries in launching the international campaign for the fight against sexual violence in armed conflict. sexual violence in conflict is an act of unbearable cruelty for the victims and their families. it is a war crime and a serious violation of human dignity and universal conscience. in the name of our common humanity, it is time to act to prevent and stop such horrors. it is time to act so that victims will no longer feel alone in their suffering, which destroys the very foundations of society. it is time to act so that the perpetrators and their accomplices in those crimes are tracked down everywhere, prosecuted and punished in a manner commensurate with the atrocities of their crimes.",Senegal,Africa,43.5345001220703,5.686560153961182,1096.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,4.562043795620437
SLE,68,2013,"i bring you sincere greetings and very best wishes from his excellency mr. ernest bai koroma, president of the republic of sierra leone. president koroma regrets that he is unable to participate in the general debate of the general assembly at its sixty-eighth session due to unavoidable circumstances. he has, however, instructed me, as his minister for foreign affairs and international cooperation, to deliver to the assembly this message of goodwill: i congratulate ambassador ashe most warmly on his election to direct the affairs of the assembly during this session and assure him of my countrys support and cooperation during his tenure. let me avail myself of this opportunity to also express the appreciation of my delegation to his predecessor, mr. vuk jeremi. of serbia, for his able leadership in directing the work of the general assembly during the past session. i wish him well in his future endeavours. let me also express sincere appreciation to the secretary-general, mr. ban ki-moon, for his constructive and fruitful leadership of the organization. sierra leone will continue to support the progressive implementation of his five-year global action agenda. over the past two decades, global peace, security and the economic environment have evidently been radically transformed, to the point where neither the problems nor their solutions are simple. the international security situation has become more complex. regional hotspot issues keep flaring up, and turbulence continues in many parts of the world, in particular asia and africa. human trafficking, in addition to other non-traditional security issues such as climate change, nuclear safety, energy, food and maritime security and financing for development are becoming more significant. the use of chemical weapons in conflict poses a renewed global security threat. there is therefore a need for increased multilateral and collective engagement and responses to those complex challenges. as we all are aware, the target date for achieving the millennium development goals (mdgs) is only two years away. while we take stock of what have been achieved and the challenges that continue to confront us, we should, in keeping with the principles set out in the united nations conference on sustainable development outcome document, entitled the future we want (resolution 66/288, annex), embark upon designing a post-2015 development goals agenda in which the specific needs and challenges of every member states are recognized. there is no doubt that failure to capture those specific needs and commitments would compromise the credibility of such an agenda. we also note that important progress has been made in many areas, such as reducing poverty globally, improving access to primary education for all children, reducing child and maternal mortality, increasing access to hiv treatment and reducing slum populations, to name a few. however, this has not been uniform, as inequalities among many populations are on the rise, particularly in southern asia and sub-saharan africa, where food insecurity and malnutrition are still prevalent. while access to health and education may be expanding for us, the quality of those services in many regions remains a serious challenge. that is why the theme of this session, the post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage, is timely and appropriate. we are moving into the phase of mapping out another development framework that is expected to formulate universal goals and responsibilities encompassing the economic, social and environmental spheres. the post-2015 development agenda should have at its core the urgent need to address the causes and consequences of conflict, violence and disasters. these are universal issues of great concern to the global community. resolving and preventing conflict and violence, creating jobs, providing further incentives for foreign direct investment, broadening human and financial resources, ensuring gender equality and promoting human rights and the rule of law are not only fundamental to human progress; they are integral to sustainable development. sierra leone welcomes the adoption of the arms trade treaty earlier this year. this is a significant and historic achievement in our collective efforts in pursuit of a safer and more secure world. we therefore hope that the illegal transfer of conventional weapons to the wrong hands a major source of the escalation of conflicts in the developing world, particularly in africa can now be largely regulated and minimized. in that regard, we remain committed to supporting international instruments aimed at establishing peace and security in the world and an economic order that is beneficial to the rich and the poor, the weak and the strong, as well as to nations big and small. in recent years, and despite being under post- conflict rebuilding, sierra leones contribution to the united nations peacekeeping efforts demonstrates our strong commitment to the purpose and principles of global peace and stability. we stand ready to increase our profile in the peacekeeping landscape so as to ensure the success of peacekeeping operations. to that end, we will continue to actively engage in all new initiatives for reform of the united nations peacekeeping operations. we applaud and acknowledge the human resources and financial support that the united nations family and other development partners continue to provide, especially towards the successful conduct of our 17 november 2012 presidential, parliamentary and local government elections, all of which were held in one day, for the very first time. those elections were widely considered to be a critical benchmark for us, signalling our preparedness to move into a more developmental phase of peacebuilding. it should come as little or no surprise that they were widely acclaimed to be peaceful, free, fair and transparent by the international community. their successful conduct clearly demonstrates the level that sierra leones democratic process has attained, an experience we are willing to share with other countries in our subregion and beyond. today, sierra leone is on the threshold of transformation in its engagement with the peacebuilding commission as well as in its socioeconomic development. with support from the commission and the peacebuilding support office as well as other international and local development partners, sierra leone continues to make significant gains in the areas of good governance, human rights, gender equality and the fight against corruption and transnational organized crime. a number of international treaties have been ratified and national legislations enacted to address these challenges, which have the potential to undermine ongoing peacebuilding and peace-consolidation efforts. sierra leones vision for transformative and inclusive socioeconomic development was initially encapsulated in my governments poverty- reduction strategy, articulated in the agenda for change that we rolled out in my first term of office. these have been encouraging achievements and with residual challenges as well. in my current, second term, we are poised to build on those successes with renewed determination. with a sustained commitment to provide improved standards of living for our people and to raise the country to middle-income status, we have rolled those residual challenges over to our successor development programme, the agenda for prosperity, which i launched in july this year. this is sierra leones road map to our post-2015 development agenda. it aims to build a sustainable future for all sierra leoneans, requiring sound macroeconomic management and fiscal policies for a society with strong institutions to facilitate good governance, the social, economic and political empowerment of women and young people, the required social support for the disadvantaged, increased transparency and accountability, and justice for all. in taking up this huge challenge, sierra leone will continue to welcome the strong partnership that exists with the various united nations agencies and other international development partners for the achievement of a well-planned, seamless transition to a more developmental phase of peacebuilding and for scaling up support to sierra leones political and economic priorities, as outlined in our agenda for prosperity. sierra leone, a nation with good credentials as a post-conflict country, is a deserving candidate for continued international support. sierra leone continues to uphold its national heritage of interreligious tolerance and peaceful coexistence, as well as the principle of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. in that regard, we remain focused on, and committed to, our reporting obligations to international treaty bodies. in line with the relevant provisions of the disability act 2011, we have established a national commission for persons with disability. the current and first chairman and chief commissioner is a person with impaired vision. we have also enacted the sexual offences act 2012 to address the specific issue of sexual violence against women and girls. sierra leone will continue to collaborate with the united nations and other interested partners in promoting the enactment of the gender equality bill so as to enhance womens participation in the decision-making process. we commend the support of the united nations and international partners for the work of the special court for sierra leone, whereby it has made meaningful contributions to the advancement of the rule of law at both the national and international levels. with our continued support, the special court is expected to complete its mandate by the end of this year. we are pleased to note that the optional protocol to the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights entered into force in may 2013. sierra leone pledges its continued support to the work of the human rights council and the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights as we strive together to maintain universally accepted standards of human rights and democratic governance. it is in that context that we have also embarked upon a constitutional review process to address major socioeconomic and political issues. a constitutional review committee has been established with a broad spectrum of membership, drawn from all political parties, civil society, women, youth, disabled persons and even the diaspora. the process will be inclusive and guided by a critical analysis in a broad national debate, with the aim of strengthening democratic institutions and promoting national unity. we expect the committee to submit a draft review within two years. as the coordinator of the african union committee of 10 heads of state on security council reforms, let me once again emphasize the need for urgent reform of the council. the role of the united nations should be strengthened, not weakened. the need for equitable geographical representation, with all the privileges of membership in the security council, cannot be overemphasized. africa will therefore continue to work closely with the relevant stakeholders and member states, particularly other non-permanent members of the council, for an early and decisive reform of that organ. let me therefore reiterate that africas participation in the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations is firmly rooted in our steadfast commitment to the african common position articulated in the ezulwini consensus and sirte declaration on the reform of the united nations. the millennium development goals remain a very lofty agenda in the history of our collective efforts for global socioeconomic development, although their full achievement has been thwarted by a multitude of factors. the year 2015 is a critical one for the united nations as it marks the organizations seventieth anniversary. it is also the target date for the mdgs and the tenth year since the world summit was held in 2005. we are expected to agree on a post-2015 development framework. it is imperative that we follow a pragmatic approach with renewed vigour and commitment to providing our people with a future that guarantees justice, peace and security, accountable and democratic governance, a transparent and equitable distribution of wealth, a safe and sustainable environment and health and education for all. those are all essential elements in setting the stage for the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda. let me join the family of the united nations in expressing our condolences and solidarity with the people of kenya, pakistan and nigeria for the irreparable loss of valuable lives during the recent terrorist attacks. our thoughts and prayers are strongly and firmly with the families of the deceased.",Sierra Leone,Africa,32.4261703491211,2.379810094833374,1964.0,7.0,0.0,7.0,3.5641547861507132
MUS,68,2013,"as we meet this morning to address global concerns and seek ways to ensure progress and lasting peace, the people of kenya are emerging from a terrorist attack that has cost them many lives and shaken the continent. in expressing our solidarity with the government and the people of kenya and with the families of the victims, mauritius would also like to express its unreserved condemnation of that abominable and dastardly act of terrorism. the nairobi attack should also compel us to revisit regional and global responses to national and international security threats, including extending support to countries, particularly those on the african continent. mauritius commends you, mr. president, for the theme you have proposed for the sixty-eighth session of the assembly, namely, the post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage. the goals we set ourselves for the sustainable development of our national and global economies will shape the lives of generations to come. i would like to say at the outset that mauritius welcomes the report of the high-level panel of eminent persons on the post-2015 development agenda, a new global partnership: eradicate poverty and transform economies through sustainable development, and in particular the recommendation that deliberations on a new development agenda must be guided by the vision of eradicating extreme poverty for all in the context of sustainable development. we also welcome the panels view that one of the transformative shifts for the post- 2015 agenda should be to bring a new sense of global partnership into national and international politics. climate change should be one of the top priorities for the global agenda. the report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, climate change 2013: the physical science basis, released only yesterday, is unequivocal. it provides clear scientific confirmation that we humans are responsible for global warming, and that it is up to us to take appropriate measures to try to save our home planet. we cannot and should not any longer ignore the evidence that we humans are putting life on earth in jeopardy. in our region, we have recently seen an increased and unprecedented intensity and unpredictability of weather events. in march, my country experienced unprecedented flash floods that caused losses of human life and heavy economic losses. no country is safe from natural disasters and the damaging effects of climate change. but for many small island developing states (sids), the foreseeable consequences of climate change threaten us even more dramatically, in terms of both human and economic development. for some sids, they pose an existential threat. we fully support the secretary-generals proposal to convene world leaders to a climate summit in new york in 2014. we hope that that meeting will provide an opportunity for world leaders to focus political attention on climate change and take meaningful action to mitigate its effects. we must start putting the interests of our home planet above everything else. the world needs a global, legally binding agreement on climate change by 2015. at the paris meeting of the twenty- first conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, we should adopt a treaty that is universal and ambitious and that concretely addresses the concerns of all, including those of the most vulnerable states. the international community should also pay more attention to disaster risk reduction and adopt a more concerted and accelerated approach to reaching the goals set out in the hyogo framework for action 2005- 2015 (see a/conf.206/6). the time has come to address disaster risks and climate-change adaptation through an integrated approach, and to adopt resilience as a common and shared vision. mauritius welcomes japans decision to host the world conference on disaster reduction in early 2015 to review the implementation of the hyogo framework and chart an ambitious post- 2015 framework for disaster risk reduction. in that regard, the holding in samoa next year of the third international conference on small island developing states could not be more timely. we hope that the conference will be a landmark in the history of a more active and collaborative partnership among sids and between sids and the international community. furthermore, it could be an opportunity to give new meaning to the concept of global concerns, issues that are, or should be, the concern of the global community at large, and not only of those who are more vulnerable and more at risk. that would be in line with the spirit of the global partnership that the high-level panel has called for. the prospects for growth in the global economy remain uncertain, largely as a result of the multiple challenges faced by developed countries. in such an interconnected and interdependent world as ours, no nation is immune to external shocks. small developing countries are very concerned about the slowdown in global growth, declines in international trade, decreasing job opportunities and rising inequality. small states are particularly susceptible to external shocks, as they are heavily dependent on foreign markets for trade, tourism and investments. they are also concerned about energy and food prices, which are subject to high volatility. my government believes that the post-2015 development agenda should include a road map for an interconnected world economic system, premised on the assumption that the global economy could very well be as weak as its weakest links. of course, the specificities of some countries or regions and the pace at which the transformative shifts are implemented may not always be appropriate for universal targets. but the conceptual approach to, and the design of, the post-2015 agenda should, more than ever before, start with the shared conviction that economies are interdependent. eradicating extreme poverty, empowering more women, providing wider opportunities to young people for education and jobs, improving health care and the management of energy, water and food are all universal concerns. the conventional divides of the past are no longer valid. we need a common development framework but with differentiated milestones and implementation strategies, given the existing disparities in the levels of development. actions taken at the national level are not sufficient; there should also be reinforced cooperation and partnerships at the regional and international levels. it is therefore imperative that the weaknesses and the inequity of the current global economic governance should be addressed urgently. we are at a juncture where we have no option but to revisit the existing global economic governance mechanisms. an overhaul of the current economic governance is clearly long overdue. we must have a more participatory system of global economic governance, where developing countries would be more involved in international economic decision-making and norm- setting. the voice of all nations, big or small, should be equally heard and taken into consideration. mauritius has, on several occasions, reiterated that the united nations economic and social council needs to play a more prominent role in global economic, social, and environmental issues. we cannot overstate the importance of coordination and synergy for avoiding duplication among parallel united nations processes and initiatives so as to ensure optimal benefit for all. my government is of the view that all the processes initiated in the rio+20 conference last year, including those relating to strengthening the economic and social council, sustainable development goals and sustainable development financing, should converge towards a single post-2015 development agenda that should be adopted during a high-level development summit in 2015. the post-2015 development agenda should complete the unfinished business of the millennium development goals. however, it should also go beyond them and provide for a systemic change and a new global economic governance. the guiding principles enshrined in the declaration on the right to development, adopted in december 1986 (resolution 41/133), are still relevant today and should not be overlooked in the formulation of a post-2015 development agenda. my country will follow, with particular interest, the work of the high-level political forum on sustainable development, especially since it replaces the commission on sustainable development, which was the primary intergovernmental forum for monitoring the implementation of the barbados programme of action and the mauritius strategy for implementation. as we set the stage for the post-2015 development agenda, we must, as global leaders, define a new global vision for the worlds oceans. the united nations system has played a crucial role in formulating, implementing and enforcing a new international order relating to the oceans. indeed, the adoption of the united nations convention on the law of the sea in 1982 will remain one of the landmarks of the twentieth century. the jurisprudence of the international court of justice and the international tribunal for the law of the sea has contributed to the settlement of maritime disputes and the promotion of international peace, security and equity in a manner not always witnessed in other areas of international relations. the establishment of the international seabed authority is another significant example of what international cooperation can lead to in other sectors. the international maritime organization and the intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco are also making significant contributions. i believe that the united nations must now take the lead in formulating a global vision for the oceans that will, in particular, expand the economic space for small island states while ensuring sustainable use of living and non-living resources. the health of our economies will depend on the health of our oceans. our vision for the future must also preserve the inherent values of the ocean space, to which we are looking for economic expansion. mauritius has taken the initiative of launching a national dialogue on how to promote the ocean economy as one of the main pillars of development. we urge the international community to build on what the world has achieved so far in relation to ocean-related economic activities and conservation, and we propose for future generations a fundamental paradigm shift with respect to economic space. while such a global vision and strategy will be beneficial to all nations, it will be of particular interest to small islands. with limited land areas, the islands can potentially be large ocean states and thus overcome some of their vulnerabilities as small island developing states. as the world realizes the tremendous potential of marine renewable energies, we will see the oceans from a different perspective. the united nations has a key role to play in promoting the rule of law at both the national and the international levels. the rule of law at the international level must be an integral part of the post-2015 agenda. open and participatory democracy, accountability and transparency are not concepts that should be promoted only at the national level. the united nations should lead by example here. we should focus on reforming our organization and on making it more responsive to the needs and aspirations of its constituents. in that context, we should work together on the reform of the security council and the revitalization of the general assembly and on improving the working methods of our organization. mauritius believes that a comprehensive reform of the security council should include reform in the membership of both the permanent and non-permanent categories. we reaffirm our commitment to the african common position enshrined in the ezulwini consensus and the sirte declaration. we believe that africa should not be deprived of its right to permanent representation in the council. likewise, we believe that latin america deserves permanent representation in the council and that sids should also be entitled to a seat on the council. mauritius further reiterates its support for indias legitimate aspiration to a permanent seat in a reformed security council. mauritius also reiterates its firm conviction that the rule of law should prevail in the resolution of disputes, in accordance with the charter of the united nations. we believe that the international community has an obligation to ensure that, in line with the principles of the rule of law, nations should submit their disputes to conciliation, mediation, adjudication or other peaceful means, both judicial and non-judicial. the dismemberment of part of our territory, the chagos archipelago, prior to independence, by the then colonial power the united kingdom, was in clear breach of international law and left the process of decolonization, not only of mauritius but of africa in general, incomplete. yet, the united kingdom has shown no inclination to engage in any process that would lead to a settlement of that shameful part of its colonial past. i am confident that the united kingdom and the united states of america want to be on the right side of history. states that look to the law and to the rules of the comity of nations for the resolution of disputes should not be frustrated by the lack of avenues under international law for the settlement of such disputes. tromelin, which is also an integral part of our territory, is the subject of ongoing discussions with the french government, and pending a final resolution of the issue, mauritius and france have concluded a framework agreement on the co-management of the island and its surrounding maritime areas, without prejudice to the sovereignty of mauritius over tromelin. in our part of the world, we welcome the rise of a re-energized africa. the return to normalcy in mali and the recent holding of elections there show the relevance of international partnerships. the situation in madagascar and in the democratic republic of the congo will, hopefully, be resolved soon through the support of the international community for the initiatives of the southern african development community in that regard. earlier this year, mauritius hosted an african ministerial conference on regional integration. we are convinced that african nations will benefit significantly from a greater focus on regional cooperation, and i am pleased to note that the solemn declaration adopted on the fiftieth anniversary of the african union supports that view. the tragic events in syria over the last two years are of serious concern to the global community. there is also concern about attempts to bypass the security council and to initiate action in breach of the united nations charter. respect for the rule of law at the international level entails compliance with internationally agreed norms. mauritius will support the decisions taken by the organs of the united nations under the charter. we welcome the security council resolution that addresses one of the issues in the syrian crisis. however, the international community needs to go further and address the issue of political dialogue, which will enable the syrian people to live in peace. mauritius also supports a middle east that is free of weapons of mass destruction. that means that no country in the region should hold nuclear or chemical weapons. mauritius is convinced that an essential condition for peace and prosperity in the middle east is the peaceful coexistence of the states of palestine and israel. mauritius wishes to reiterate its solidarity with the palestine national authority and the palestinian people in their rightful aspiration to win full recognition as a state member of the united nations. mauritius also supports the peaceful restoration of democracy in egypt, which has a key role to play in promoting stability and security in the region. but the international community cannot condone the removal by force from office and the detention of a democratically elected leader. (spoke in french) the general debate of the general assembly offers us a unique opportunity to highlight the most urgent challenges that humankind is currently facing. we must take advantage of this opportunity to review recent events and to outline new approaches that will enable us to respond to these challenges in keeping with the principles enshrined in the charter of the united nations. we must address those challenges through a shared vision of peace, security, interdependence and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms. we must remain staunch in protecting the right to development. we also have the duty to take a differentiated approach so as to ensure that our development model is sustainable and allows us to leave to future generations the values our world holds dear. our success will depend on the collective will and commitment. if we succeed, we will go down in history as having met todays challenges and expectations in terms of the future. (spoke in english) to conclude, let me say that we need to act together, in a spirit of compromise and tolerance. we should constantly remind ourselves that we are of one kind, humankind. there are not, and never will be, ideal solutions that will satisfy all of us. but we, the leaders of our respective countries, need to look beyond the horizon and have the moral courage to look at our common humanity so that we may move forward towards making our world a better, more prosperous and safer place for the whole of humankind.",Mauritius,Africa,91.4900283813477,3.567759990692139,2784.0,11.0,0.0,11.0,3.951149425287357
MWI,69,2014,"allow me to begin by congratulating mr. sam kutesa on his election as president of the general assembly at its sixty-ninth session. i have no doubt that his election at this juncture will bring to the notice of the world some of the problems and opportunities that exist in africa. malawi and uganda have enjoyed cordial relations for a long time and my government and my delegation will do all we can to support him in that very important position. let me also take the opportunity to congratulate his predecessor, ambassador john william ashe, for guiding the work of the sixty-eighth session of the general assembly with skill and pragmatism. i would also like to thank secretary-general ban ki-moon for the steady manner in which he continues to guide our global organization. on 20 may, my country held its first ever tripartite elections, which enabled malawians to choose their political leadership through a democratic and peaceful process. the elections ushered me into office as the fifth president of the republic of malawi. i would therefore like to inform the assembly that, despite a few challenges, the elections were free, fair, transparent and credible. in that vein, let me seize the opportunity to thank all the electoral stakeholders, both local and international, for their dedication to ensuring successful elections in my country. malawi has come out of the election much stronger than before. on 6 july, malawi commemorated the golden jubilee of its independence. as we commemorate the 50 years of peace, law and order, we have tasked ourselves with taking stock of the development that the country has registered since 1964, as well as the challenges that the country faces today. much of the country has made some progress in diverse sectors of our national development, but there is still more to be done in order to uplift the living standards of the many malawians who continue to remain below the poverty line. they too dream of a better future, which is possible only if we work with unity of purpose. in a quest to take development to the micro level, my government has embarked on a journey to transform malawi so as to ensure the delivery of satisfactory services to malawians, especially the poor and the marginalized. as the assembly is aware, malawi was the chair of the southern africa development community (sadc) from august 2013 until august 2014. during our term of office, we strove as a region to achieve long-lasting peace and stability in our countries. in that vein, let me commend my country, malawi, and the countries of madagascar and south africa for holding peaceful and credible elections. the sadc group has been undertaking a number of efforts aimed at ending the cycle of conflicts and violence in the region. in the democratic republic of the congo, sadc deployed the force intervention brigade, comprising troops from malawi, south africa and tanzania, under the auspices of the united nations organization stabilization mission in the democratic republic of the congo, as authorized under security council resolution 2098 (2013). the sadc group, as well as the international community, is pleased with the success achieved in getting the mouvement du 23 mars and other negative forces to leave the country and surrender. in madagascar, sadc played a crucial role in bringing back constitutional normalcy in the country. in terms of international peace and security, i would like to inform this gathering that malawi has always supported the disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. to that end, we have supported resolutions in the general assembly aimed at nuclear disarmament. over and above that, a couple of months ago, my country held an in-country workshop to come up with mechanisms to implement security council resolution 1540 (2004) at the national level to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery. on the same subject, in the middle east, malawi has always been disheartened and disappointed by the continuing violence and loss of life and property resulting from the conflict between israel and palestine. that cannot go on forever. we trust that the two-state solution to the conflict, with israel and palestine living side by side, in peace and harmony, is the only viable way to achieve lasting peace in the region. we encourage both sides to the dispute to renounce violence, exercise utmost restraint and employ dialogue as the sure tool to reach a political settlement. as for the post-2015 development agenda, the choice of delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda as the theme for the sixty-ninth session of the general assembly could not be more appropriate. the fight against poverty, hunger and inequality constitutes the greatest challenge of our time. the theme further augurs well for the future in relation to the plans and aspirations of the people of malawi. malawi appreciates the consultative nature of the process followed in designing the post-2015 development agenda. let me therefore commend the secretary-generals initiatives to ensure an inclusive process that will lead to the post-2015 development agenda. with financial and technical support from the united nations, more than 50 countries have conducted national consultations, in which people provided input and direction on the post-2015 development framework. i am pleased that malawi was one of the countries selected for those national consultations. the post- 2015 development agenda should reflect the needs and priorities of the developing world. it is important that the next global development agenda draw lessons from the successes and challenges of the current blueprint being used, namely, the millennium development goals (mdgs). rather than seeing 2015 as an end point, we must think of it as the beginning of a new era, an era in which we eradicate extreme poverty, protect the environment and promote economic opportunity for all. the mdgs have played an important role in concentrating our efforts around the common purpose of eradicating poverty. they have raised public awareness about the unacceptable levels of poverty and have helped mobilize action towards a fairer world. the mdgs provided a common framework for monitoring progress, highlighting areas of achievement as well as challenges. malawi is on track for achieving four of the eight mdgs, namely, reducing child mortality; combating hiv/aids, malaria and other diseases; ensuring environmental sustainability; and developing a global partnership for development. however, we are unlikely to meet the other four goals, namely, eradicating extreme poverty and hunger; achieving universal access to education; ensuring gender equality and the empowerment of women; and improving maternal health. malawi will therefore be proceeding to the post- 2015 development agenda with unfinished business from the mdgs. one reason why developing countries like malawi have failed to achieve all of the millennium development goals is inadequate resources. commitments made by development partners have been unpredictable and have often gone unfulfilled. to achieve delivery of the post-2015 development agenda, the global community should not repeat that mistake. more importantly, accountability and transparency, as well as monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, should be promoted. it is therefore imperative that, as we move closer to welcoming the new global development agenda, we should all be mindful of the importance of global partnership for effective development cooperation. that would ensure the agendas successful implementation in developing countries. the post-2015 development agenda should not be seen as a one-size-fits-all global development framework. malawi is looking forward to a framework that is shared, but differentiated enough, where developing countries, depending on their special needs and unique characteristics, will have flexibility in implementing programmes. my delegation is pleased with the tremendous progress made thus far in defining the post-2015 development agenda. it is in that context that i would like to reiterate and confirm malawis commitment to achieving sustainable development in three interconnected dimensions, namely, economic development, including the end of extreme poverty; social inclusion; and environmental sustainability. i am convinced that member states gathered here today will own the outcome document of the post-2015 development agenda and will be committed to its full implementation. it is also encouraging to note that the sustainable development goals that emanated from the open working group on sustainable development goals have incorporated the development concerns of both the developed and developing world. with respect to security council reform, the year 2015 will mark, as the general assembly is aware, the seventieth anniversary of the united nations. as such, it will be an occasion for all of us to bring new energy into the organization and carry out the important reforms that we have been calling for since its inception. for instance, the limited representation in the security council is a source of great concern, particularly in the light of the challenges of the twenty- first century. only by expanding the number of permanent and non-permanent members of the council and by including developing countries in both categories will we be able to solve some of the legitimacy deficits under which the council is currently labouring. in conclusion, i would submit that the centre of the post-2015 development agenda should be to address the plight of hitherto disadvantaged groups, such as women, girls and persons with disabilities. it is a well- known fact that the ugly face of poverty manifests itself through women, girls and persons with disabilities. it is sad that africa, the continent to which malawi belongs, shares the following worrisome statistics in terms of human development. first, its share of global poverty is as high as 30 per cent. secondly, 40 per cent of the continents children under 5 are stunted in their growth. thirdly, africas share of global child mortality amounts to 50 per cent. finally, 50 per cent of africas children are not in school. i urge that the post-2015 development agenda give priority to those challenges for redress. africa has already spoken clearly about its priorities through the common african position on the post-2015 development agenda and through the african unions agenda 2063, which aspires to achieve a prosperous, peaceful and integrated africa. in that vein, i wish to call on all stakeholders to join the global partnership for effective development cooperation principles by implementing and delivering on a transformative post-2015 development agenda. malawi will use its position as chair of the global partnership for effective development cooperation to help realize that cause.",Malawi,Africa,65.1453704833984,3.660060068505552,1714.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,2.9171528588098017
MAR,69,2014,"his majesty king mohammed vi, sovereign of the kingdom of morocco, asked me to convey to the assembly his greetings. he also asked me to deliver the following statement, prepared for the sixty-ninth session of the general assembly: it gives me great pleasure to take part in the sixty-ninth session of the general assembly, for which president kutesa has suggested delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda as the central theme. that is a very relevant choice, which is fully in line with our organizations priorities, especially as it encompasses economic, social, environmental, security and political considerations. i have therefore decided to devote my address to that important topic, knowing that the kingdom of moroccos standpoint regarding other items on the sessions agenda will be presented during the general assembly committee meetings or at the ministerial meetings, which will be held on the sidelines of the general assembly. achieving sustainable development is one of the pressing challenges facing humankind. it is particularly important, in that respect, to strike a balance between the requirements for economic and social progress and the protection of the environment, on the one hand, and the safeguard of the rights of future generations, on the other. aware of those critical challenges, we have sought to set up a distinctive development model rooted in the culture and in the specific national values of the moroccan people a model which also takes into account the need for positive interaction with international principles and objectives in that area. morocco has therefore managed to develop a pioneering national initiative for human development, together with ambitious programmes in the field of renewable energy especially solar and wind power generation which are a key component of sustainable development. however, i am not here today to discuss my countrys experience or our achievements. i am here to make an appeal for developing countries to be treated fairly, especially in africa, and for the development issue to be addressed objectively. as the assembly knows, sustainable development is not something that can be achieved through decisions and ready-made prescriptions, nor is there a single model in that area. indeed, every country follows a path of its own, taking into consideration its historical development, cultural heritage, human and natural resources, specific political circumstances, as well as its economic choices and the obstacles and challenges facing it. what applies to the west should not be used as the sole criterion for determining the efficiency of other development models; nor should one make comparisons between countries, however similar their circumstances may be, even when those countries belong to the same geographical area. as a result, the first call i should like to make from the rostrum regards the need to respect the characteristic values and principles of every country as it builds its own development model. that is particularly true for the developing countries that are still suffering from the consequences of colonialism. colonialism caused severe damage to colonized countries. for many years, it hindered their development process, exploited their resources, as well as the energies of their sons and daughters, brought about profound change in the customs and cultures of the peoples concerned and sowed the seeds not only of division between members of the same community, but also of conflict and discord between neighbouring countries. although many years have passed, the colonizers bear a historical responsibility for the tough and at times tragic circumstances experienced by some countries of the south, particularly in africa. today, given the adverse consequences suffered, former colonial powers have no right to ask the countries of the south to introduce radical change rapidly, on the basis of a frame of reference with which they are unfamiliar, be it in terms of their cultures, their principles or their values. it is as if no development were possible other than through a single model: that of the west. i now turn to the second appeal i would like to make to the international community. we need more realism and wisdom when dealing with those countries. there should also be greater consideration for their circumstances and the paths they choose to achieve democracy and development. some western countries which asked for no ones authorization to colonize countries of the south instead of currently providing the necessary assistance to the people of those countries, continue to impose on them harsh conditions, thereby hampering their ability to make progress. furthermore, all western countries and their affiliated institutions do is give lessons, and, at best, a few pieces of advice. as for support, it is very limited and is always conditional. what is more, they ask the countries of the south to achieve stability and development within a very short time frame and according to imposed conditions, without taking into account those countries development processes or their specific national circumstances. there can be no stability without development. by the same token, development cannot be achieved without stability. both hinge on respect for the sovereignty of states, their territorial integrity, culture and customs, as well as on a dignified life for all their citizens. moreover, the rating and classification of those countries, according to current standards, raises a number of questions. the rating process has not only shown its limitations, but also how far removed it is from the reality of the countries of the south and how incapable it is of giving an objective account of the level of human development achieved by those countries. as inadequate as it unfortunately is, the aid granted is often based on those ratings and their quasi-impossible conditions. we therefore appeal for intangible capital to be one of the primary criteria for measuring wealth and rating nations. as clearly shown by world bank studies, intangible capital takes into consideration a series of factors related to the living conditions of the population, such as security, stability, human resources, institutional development and the quality of life and of the environment, all of which are elements that have a major impact on crafting public policies. the evolution of those countries should not be governed by any rating or classification; instead, it should be viewed as a historical process based on the positive experiences of each country. similarly, every countrys characteristics should be respected. the reference to the negative impact of colonialism does not mean we wish to put any party in the dock of a law court. it is simply an earnest appeal for justice for the countries of the south and a reconsideration of the way they are dealt with and supported in their gradual march towards progress. in my address in abidjan, in february, i insisted on the fact that africa did not need humanitarian aid as much as it needed mutually beneficial partnerships. i also stressed that africa needed to turn the page on its past and overcome its political, economic and social problems that it needed to rely on its own resources to achieve its development. that is exactly what morocco has sought to accomplish through a series of important agreements signed with a number of african sister nations. in that respect, i wish to mention in particular the strategic agreement signed with gabon for the production of fertilizers for african markets in order to contribute to development and food security on the african continent, which is home to a staggering 60 per cent of the worlds unexploited land. that is an outstanding model of south-south cooperation that reflects our capacity as african countries to develop the continent by relying on ourselves and investing in the natural resources of our countries. as the assembly knows, achieving development does not hinge merely on a set of projects and on funding; nor is underdevelopment synonymous with the countries of the south. indeed, the problem has nothing to do with africans attributes and skills. africans have proved their ability to produce and create whenever the right conditions are met, and whenever they are able to rid themselves of the oppressive legacy of colonialism. similarly, development in africa has little to do with the nature of the land or the weather, as harsh as they may be in some parts of the continent. it is more closely related to a deep-rooted economic dependence, a lack of support and funding and the absence of a sustainable development model. as a result, providing aid to those countries is not an option or an act of generosity so much as it is a necessity and a duty. what states really need, though, is fruitful cooperation, grounded in mutual respect, so that they can create the right conditions, in theory and in practice, to move on to the next stage of the process of promoting both democracy and development, without any interference by others in their internal affairs. in return, they must commit to good governance. the world stands at a crossroads today. either the international community supports developing countries in their quest to achieve progress and ensure security and stability, or we shall all face the consequences of more conflicts and greater fanaticism, violence and terrorism all of which feed on feelings of injustice and exclusion and no part of the world will be safe. as people grow more acutely aware of the cross-border threats posed by the lack of sustainable and human development, and as we realize that ours is ultimately a common destiny, i am sure that eventually there will be a global awakening regarding the need to work for a more secure, equitable and humane world.",Morocco,Africa,75.5861968994141,5.482760366427215,1584.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
ZAF,69,2014,"i should like to congratulate you, mr. president, and your country, uganda, on assuming, on behalf of the continent of africa, the responsibilities of president of the general assembly at its sixty-ninth session. the theme that you have chosen for this general debate and the sixty-ninth session, namely, delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda, is timely and most appropriate. the millennium development goals (mdgs) galvanized and mobilized the international community and the united nations in a manner never seen before. we have good stories to tell about the journey of the past 15 years of implementing the mdgs. in africa, we seized the opportunity and adopted the new partnership for africas development (nepad), our sociodevelopment blueprint. the african unions vision 2063 will, together with nepad and other socioeconomic development programmes, be the cornerstone and foundation of africas development agenda going forward. south africa has also made significant progress in achieving the mdgs. reducing by half the number of people earning less than a dollar a day has been achieved, while the proportion of those experiencing hunger has also been halved. south africa has attained goal 2, namely, to provide access to primary education for all. by official international indicators, south africa is also doing well on mdg 3 to promote and empower women. south africa has recorded impressive progress through the expansion of its health infrastructure and improved access to health services for all south africans. on the reduction of child mortality, mdg 4, and the improvement of maternal health, mdg 5, significant progress has also been recorded, but more work remains to be done. in fact. more work remains worldwide to fully achieve those goals, especially in the developing world. we have to confront the underlying root causes that continue to make it impossible for our people to have a better life. in spite of the progress that we have made thus far, reports continue to show that africa is lagging behind in the attainment of some of the mdgs. it is for that reason that we appreciate the crafting of a post-2015 global development agenda that will carry forward the unfinished business of the mdgs. the post-2015 global development agenda will provide a frame of reference for our collective agreement on what has to be done. we reiterate that developed countries should be reliable partners and meet their commitments to development goals, such as contributing 0.7 per cent of their gross national income towards official development assistance. we say that because it does not matter what the great organization has achieved in the past six decades if we do not deal comprehensively with the scourge of poverty, unemployment and diseases. the poor of the world will then consider everything done to have been a failure. indeed, we would have failed in our duty if we succeed in preventing another world war but continue to have children dying of malnutrition and treatable diseases. the recent outbreak of ebola in some west african states and the number of lives that have been unnecessarily lost provide a clear example of the challenges that developing countries continue to contend with. we believe that ebola would have been contained within a few days had the outbreak been in the developed world. but now it has become a pandemic that threatens the economies of affected african states. the outbreak has thus exposed the challenges resulting from lack of capacity, lack of infrastructure and other limited resources in africa. we are pleased that the united nations, under the leadership of the secretary-general, is deploying a mission to coordinate efforts to combat the virus. south africa stands ready to continue to provide whatever resources we have at our disposal to assist the people and governments of our sister countries of liberia, guinea and sierra leone. we add our voice in calling for more resources to be deployed so as to ensure that the virus is contained. the role of the united nations in supporting the struggles of self-determination and freedom has been remarkable. south africa is a shining example. twenty years ago, president nelson mandela thanked all nations for support from this very podium when south africa was readmitted to the united nations as a free and democratic state. we are reminded of that fact on this important day, which is national heritage day in my country. since 1994, south africa has made significant progress in transforming the apartheid state into a democratic one, founded on the values of human dignity, non-discrimination, non-racialism and non-sexism, the rule of law and universal adult suffrage, as enshrined in the constitution. given our history and heritage, we are mindful of our historic and moral responsibility in the global struggle against racism, racial discrimination and other intolerances. we will, in this regard, continue to be at the forefront of efforts to eliminate all forms of racism, racial discrimination and any other intolerance, including xenophobia and anti-semitism. the durban declaration and programme of action remain the primary framework adopted by a united nations conference in the fight against racism. we will continue to support the struggles for freedom and self-determination, including the struggles of the peoples of palestine and western sahara, who continue to experience occupation and colonialism of different forms. the people of cuba also hold a special place in our hearts because of that countrys sacrifice for african freedom. we will therefore continue to support their struggle for economic liberation. while the united nations has done remarkably well in supporting self-determination, when it celebrates 70 years of existence next year, this body may be found wanting by the people of palestine. the israeli-palestine question is one of the oldest items on the united nations agenda, but progress remains elusive. in the past few months in particular, the world has witnessed a devastating conflict that left a humanitarian crisis of shocking proportions. people in palestine were left homeless, with no medical facilities, no safe drinking water, bereaved and having to care for the wounded after a trail of destructive military actions by israel. south africa has condemned the actions of both israel and hamas, and we have called for an immediate cessation of hostilities. our strongly held view is that there can be no military solution to the israeli- palestinian question. we should all remain committed to the two-state solution, based on the 1967 borders, with palestine and israel coexisting side by side in peace. of concern in this matter has been the helplessness displayed by the united nations, especially the security council during the current conflict. the united nations has the moral authority and legitimacy to unite the world in promoting the quest for peace, justice and self-determination for the people of palestine, while addressing whatever security concerns israel may have. this body must play its role without fear or favour and be a beacon for all who suffer oppression in the world. let me reiterate that the seventieth anniversary of the united nations next year provides an opportunity for us seriously to reflect on the need to reform this august body, moving beyond words to action. ten years ago, world leaders celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the united nations agreed on the need for reform of the security council in particular. the decision remains valid and must be implemented. when we convene here next year, in the seventieth year of the united nations, we should be able to adopt a concrete programme that will guide us towards a strengthened united nations and a reformed security council. some contentious aspects of the united nations system, including the power of veto and the exclusion of regions such as africa from the security council, are some of the critical matters that cannot be ignored in the quest for transformation. among the achievements of the organization in its recent history is the cooperation between the african union and the united nations, particularly since the formation of the african union peace and security architecture. in this regard, the full implementation of security council resolutions 1809 (2008) and 2033 (2012), on cooperation between the united nations and regional organizations, particularly the african union, remains crucial. progress has been made in a number of areas where this cooperation is in place, for example in the democratic republic of congo. the two affected subregional organizations, the southern african development community and the international conference on the great lakes region, continue to take significant strides with the support of the united nations. this body celebrated the formation of a new state of south sudan not long ago. recent developments and the ongoing conflict in south sudan have resulted in loss of life and other dire humanitarian consequences. we will continue to contribute as much as we can to finding solutions working with the african union and this body. south sudan should not be allowed to regress. next year marks 20 years since the the fourth world conference on women adopted the beijing platform for action. the anniversary provides an opportunity for the united nations and the international community to reflect and take forward the struggle for the emancipation of women from all forms of discrimination. last december, the world descended on south africa to pay last respects to our beloved madiba. those who did not come to south africa honoured madiba in various ways. we will continue to work with the world to promote madibas legacy and passion for justice, freedom, equality and human rights. we are grateful to the general assembly and the president of the assembly at the sixty-eighth session for the decision to establish the united nations nelson rolihlahla mandela prize that will be awarded to an outstanding individual who will have demonstrated a commitment to the aims, objectives and principles of the united nations charter. the prize is a great testament to the outstanding individual that madiba was and will always be. as we recommit to the millennium development goals, let me once again borrow from the words of madiba uttered on his historic inauguration day in 1994 when he said: we understand it still that there is no easy road to freedom. we know it well that none of us acting alone can achieve success. we must therefore act together as a united people, for national reconciliation, for nation building, for the birth of a new world. let there be justice for all. let there be peace for all. let there be work, bread, water and salt for all. let each know that for each the body, the mind and the soul have been freed to fulfil themselves.",South Africa,Africa,94.1399002075195,5.489779949188232,1759.0,7.0,0.0,7.0,3.979533826037522
KEN,69,2014,"it is a great pleasure to address the general assembly at its sixty-ninth session. as the current chairman of the east african community, i am particularly pleased to see the honourable sam kutesa preside over the general assembly. i assure you, mr. president, of the full support of my government during your presidency. i would like to begin by lending my voice to all of those who have called for urgent and sustained attention to the devastating ebola crisis in liberia, sierra leone and guinea. beyond the tragedy of the thousands who have lost lives and loved ones and the many more living with that threat, livelihoods and businesses have collapsed and aspirations for shared prosperity continue to shrink day by day. kenya stands in solidarity with the countries affected by this devastating virus. earlier this month the kenyan people gave $1 million to the effort to bring the crisis under control, and we stand ready to do more. last week, ministers of health from the east africa region converged in nairobi and agreed on measures to safeguard our populations and ensure that the virus does not spread in our region. the suspension of international flights into monrovia and other affected capitals, including by kenya airways, followed a stark warning from the world health organization (who). those measures, among others, have isolated the affected countries and further hurt the people and economies of the region. with regard to kenya, our intention was not to do harm, but the warning from the who left us, as a regional hub, with few options. we stand ready to resume kenya airways flights once appropriate measures are put in place. kenya believes that nothing in the immediate future requires more attention and determined response from the international community than the effort to stop and contain that devastating virus. i therefore welcome the establishment by the secretary-general of the united nations mission for ebola emergency response, which i am sure will guide a collective global response. the ebola crisis underlines the imperative to build strong states that can withstand crisis and respond to emergencies. state weakness in many african countries comes from a history of development paradigms and practices that weakened the state. we must commit to building strong, resilient and accountable states that can effectively respond to shocks, adversities and emergencies in the future. you, sir, are presiding over a session of the general assembly of historic significance to humankind. the sixty-ninth session will oversee the development and adoption of the post-2015 development agenda. this effort will build on the work of the open working group on sustainable development goals, which developed those goals. kenya is indeed proud to have been at the forefront of driving the open working group process. the new world development agenda must address itself to the entire cross-section of social, economic and environmental challenges that face the world in the twenty-first century. issues of sustained economic development, equality among nations, climate change, industrialization, biodiversity loss and environmental protection must now go hand in glove with the traditional challenges of poverty, disease, hunger and inequality within nations. the new agenda must therefore be universal and comprehensive and responsive to all nations equally in order to be transformative in its impact. we in kenya recognize, however, that a number of obstacles stand in the way of achieving the new development agenda. the most immediate of these are terrorism and violent extremism. in kenya, we stand at a critical moment. as we deepen our democracy, we find our nation thrust onto the front line of a regional and global war against terror. we have become acutely aware that the interplay between democratization, on the one hand, and effective counter-terrorism, on the other, presents severe challenges to our security and our governance institutions. increasingly, terrorist actors are exploiting the expanded democratic space, sometimes feeding into and even influencing local politics. unless we can provide an effective buffer to fight back against that tendency, kenya and indeed other countries will find it difficult to entrench democracy and the post-2015 development agenda. besides the immediate threat of terrorism, the state of economic and social well-being is also affected by the lack of sustainable peace and security in many of our countries. from the central african republic to mali, libya and even as far afield as the middle east and europe, we see new conflicts and crises that could derail or delay development. in kenya, we are particularly concerned by the perennial fragility that has come to characterize the greater horn of africa. in somalia, kenya continues to sacrifice lives and resources in an effort to bring peace to our neighbour. we do this trusting that the international community will stay the course in somalia. this involves consolidating peace and investing in stable, responsive national institutions that guarantee public safety, promote democracy and civil liberties, as well as development and peace in the country and region. as we meet here, south sudan also remains in turmoil. kenya and other countries of the intergovernmental authority on development (igad) have invested considerable effort in ending that tragedy and sparing the people of south sudan further suffering. regrettably, however, progress has been slow. we cannot let that young nation and its people down. at this session of the assembly, i make a special plea for south sudan, for no nation has, over the years, suffered as much neglect from the international community. similarly, no country today remains as desperately in need of rapid and transformative economic and social development as south sudan. we cannot allow a return to political chaos, economic collapse or social desperation. i implore the leaders of that young nation to demonstrate determined and enlightened leadership and to make peace without further delay. such action will save the people of the nation enormous suffering and offer hope of a better future. i thank the security council for its continued cooperation with igad in the search for peace in south sudan. it is this concert of action that will help to bring about lasting peace, which in turn will form the basis for a transformative post- 2015 development agenda for south sudan and all of its neighbours. on the continent of africa the development model of the past 50 years has run its course. that outmoded model was defined by negative trade relations, paternalistic global governance regimes and overreliance on official development assistance. moreover, it was driven by external prescriptions for development that were heavy on political instruction, but light on economic and social transformation. we now know better. we know that our social and economic transformation shall come first from within our nations, our region and our continent, and only secondly from the complement of external ideas and resources. equally important, those external contributions must recognize the primacy of our aspirations and ideas. they must value and safeguard, rather than simply exploit and consume, our domestic resources and the product of our peoples labour. for the post-2015 development agenda to be transformative, therefore, it must first embrace the primacy of developing countries whose people seek sustained development most. anything less will be a recipe for failure. we cannot speak of development or of transformation when millions of the worlds people are mired in and are broken by unrelenting poverty, disease and hunger. the business of ridding the world of those plagues, touched upon but not fully embraced by the millennium development goals, must be the first of the aspirations of the post-2015 development agenda. equally important, it must be fully financed and accelerated, if we are to lay the groundwork for a transformative agenda for the next generation. i cannot emphasize that point enough. the scourge and shame of debilitating poverty, preventable diseases and chronic hunger must be erased from our global civilization. in reaching the sustainable development goals we have set ourselves, within a time frame of 15 years, we must not fail. this year, at the united nations, kenya is proud to have presided over the conference of states parties to the convention on the rights for persons with disabilities. kenya also presided over the united nations forum on forests and co-chaired the open working group on sustainable development goals. kenya is currently presiding over the unicef board, as it seeks to provide global leadership for issues of concern to the worlds children and their well-being. kenya is a member in good standing of the international community and it intends to continue to shoulder its global and regional responsibilities. kenya is especially proud of the scores of kenyans who work for the united nations here in new york, but also further afield in peacemaking, peacekeeping, peacebuilding and in many united nations organizations in various united nations stations around the world, including nairobi. i salute all those kenyans every single one of them for their dedication and commitment. we in kenya believe that no nation is too poor or too rich, too big or too small to play its rightful role in making the world a better place for all. at the national level, kenya grounds her transformative agenda on a strategic vision our vision 2030. importantly, in 2010 we adopted a new democratic constitution, which expanded and guaranteed a wider range of rights for our people and defined new institutions for the advancement of those rights. drawing on that, we have re-engineered our system of governance, making it more democratic, inclusive, devolved and responsive. we have also significantly expanded participation in political and development decision-making. in four short years, we have begun to witness the fruits of those foundational changes. aware of the imperative to carry along all our people in development, my government launched targeted interventions for the most vulnerable in society. those include a number of financial initiatives and training programmes for women and youth. we have also prioritized the advancement of childrens rights and welfare through initiatives that reduce mortality and morbidity. chief among them are universal immunization coverage, the promotion of breast-feeding for the first six months of a childs life, the provision of fortified foods and insecticide-treated mosquito nets, as well as free care for mothers and children in all government hospitals. in that respect, i wish to commend the first lady of kenya, ms. margaret kenyatta, for successfully launching the beyond zero campaign that is tapping into private sector financing to bolster the management of chronic preventable diseases, including hiv/aids, and to improve maternal and child health throughout the country. kenya is today on track to achieve universal primary education. based on that, we have expanded our vision to include universal secondary education. we are seeking to build a more inclusive society, and strive to leave no one behind. it is for that reason that my government has implemented a social protection cash transfer programme to orphans and vulnerable children, persons with severe disabilities and our elderly citizens. the programme targets 450,000 households throughout kenya. impact evaluations indicate that the programme has reduced poverty, improved family health and raised school enrolment. as the assembly is aware, kenya is a leading tourist destination. we are also endowed with a number of rare species, some endangered, which we hold in trust for humankind. my government attaches great value to conservation. we continue to raise awareness of the need to step up the fight against poaching and illicit wildlife trafficking. we have enacted laws to help fight the scourge, and continue to work with other countries and organizations to enhance the protection of our fauna and flora. similarly, kenya remains at the heart of international efforts to mitigate and adapt to challenges relating to climate change. we continue to work towards achieving 10-per cent forest cover; we are well above global targets for renewable energy use, and fully support all measures agreed upon at the recent united nations environmental assembly in nairobi. recognizing that our prosperity is linked to that of our neighbours, kenya is engaged in a range of programmes and activities to hasten eastern african integration. we have eased the movement of goods and services across our borders. more importantly, our people can travel, work and settle across east africa. we have also grown our trade volumes and are looking to closer integration across a range of other sectors. those are a few highlights of my governments transformative agenda. we are committed to safeguarding and expanding those initiatives by creating an enabling and secure environment. in light of that, my government continues to invest heavily to combat extremists and terrorists. the global effort needs to be reinforced because, as we know, the intent of terrorists is to destroy free, secure and democratic nations and people. as long as international terrorism exploits our open, multicultural and multi-religious society and gravely harms our social fabric, our progress towards achieving the goals of a transformative agenda will no doubt be slowed. kenya believes in a better, happier and more prosperous future for all. it is my hope that the confluence of forces that have come together to continually make our development efforts unnecessarily difficult will be persuaded with urgency, to reassess their motives and hopefully re-engage within the global community and with our country and region in a more positive, constructive and humane manner; recognizing that, in the end, no one people, nor one country, not even any one continent, can inhabit the world peaceably alone in isolation from the rest of the globe. we are in this world together to succeed together, to win together and to build a better future for all everywhere, together.",Kenya,Africa,78.733039855957,4.717299938201904,2254.0,10.0,0.0,10.0,4.436557231588288
AGO,69,2014,"on behalf of the government of the republic of angola, allow me to congratulate you, mr. sam kutesa, on your election as president of the general assembly at its sixty-ninth session, and to assure you of my countrys support as you fulfil your mission. i would also like to congratulate ambassador john william ashe for the competent manner in which he led the work of the previous session. we extend our greetings to secretary-general ban ki-moon and commend him for his commitment to finding solutions to the issues facing the international community. this session of the general assembly is taking place in an environment that gives rise to concern due to the aggravation of international tensions, the intensification of conflicts and the deepening of global crises that require effective and sustainable solutions. it is a matter of consensus that the solutions to common challenges are to be found in multilateral negotiations and should take into account the specificities of each country and each people. the united nations has always been and will continue to be the mainstay of member states participation in decision-making on issues of concern to the international community and in upholding the global values of tolerance and peaceful and harmonious coexistence of countries and peoples, in accordance with the principles set forth in the charter of the united nations and international law. angola would once again like to reiterate the importance of all member states joining in efforts to make the united nations a strong and effective organization, and one that serves as the basis for a more balanced, fair and inclusive international legal order and global security system, while promoting confidence among states and strengthening relations of friendship and international cooperation. our organization should pay special attention to the resurgence of armed conflicts and their negative effects on populations, as well as to arms flows, trafficking in drugs and human beings, transnational organized crime, international terrorism and piracy all phenomena that have an adverse impact on economic development and consequently impede the improvement of living conditions. religious fundamentalism in some african countries is taking on such violent proportions that it poses a threat to regional security, with serious consequences for peace, stability and development. angola strongly condemns the acts committed by terrorist groups and expresses its support for efforts to ensure the full neutralization of those groups. angola supports efforts to strengthen the crisis-management capacity of the united nations and considers dialogue and negotiation to be the best means of resolving conflicts. we will continue to meet our international obligations, with special emphasis on the african continent and the regional groupings in which we operate, including the southern african development community, the economic community of central african states, the african countries that use portuguese as an official language, the gulf of guinea commission and the international conference on the great lakes region, with a view to defining mechanisms and forms of cooperation with the united nations, the african union, the community of portuguese-speaking countries and other international partners. angola assumed the rotating presidency of the international conference on the great lakes region in january, and in that forum continues to promote the resolution of conflicts on the african continent with a view to attaining stability, political and institutional development, internal and border security, good governance and human rights. it is in that context that angola is engaged in the peace processes in the democratic republic of the congo, the central african republic and the great lakes region. the ebola epidemic is an issue of great concern. the position of the security council, which declared the epidemic to be a threat to international peace and security, fully reflects the seriousness of the situation. a decisive commitment on the part of the international community is required if the scourge is to be combated and eradicated. we reiterate the need to reform and revitalize the united nations system, in particular the need to reform the security council, which should be brought into line with the current international context and whose membership should reflect an equitable geographical representation through an increase in the number of permanent members. angola reiterates the right of the african continent to sit among the permanent members of the council. the israeli-palestinian conflict and the lack of progress in finding a lasting solution are a major cause of widespread instability in the middle east, and also the root cause of the resurgence of terrorism in the region. that situation worries the government of angola. we call for political will and flexibility from both parties, and we encourage the secretary-general and the united states secretary of state to continue their mediation efforts with a view to establishing a sovereign and independent palestinian state, as well as a modus vivendi to ensure that the two states coexist in peace and security within internationally recognized borders. the impasse in resolving the question of western sahara continues to delay the exercise of the right to self-determination of the people of that territory. angola calls on the parties to continue negotiations under the auspices of the united nations and the african union in order to find a solution in accordance with the principles of the charter of the united nations and resolution 1514 (xv) of december 1960. with regard to the situation in the ukraine, angola deplores the loss of human lives caused by instability in the region and calls for dialogue between the parties involved to find a political solution to the conflict. the situations in somalia and south sudan remain cause for concern. however, there has been some encouraging progress, which is why we urge the authorities in those countries and the international community to continue their efforts for stabilization. angola welcomes the constitutional normalization in some african countries. we welcome the holding of democratic elections in guinea-bissau, madagascar and egypt, and we express our solidarity with the national reconciliation and reconstruction processes and the economic and social development in those countries. the government of angola expresses its appreciation for the choice of the central theme of this session, delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda. it is greatly relevance, especially for the least developed countries. the progress made in some of those countries is far behind the targets of the millennium development goals, due to structural issues, and is insufficient to mitigate the persistent effects of the economic problems. with one year remaining until the final assessment of the achievement of the millennium development goals, our economies continue to suffer the effects of the international economic and financial crisis, which create barriers to economic growth and hinder the implementation of programmes to combat poverty and improve the living conditions of our peoples. however, we note with satisfaction that the african continent has ceased to present the image of desolation it did at the beginning of the millennium. a new reality has emerged in which african countries boast an average growth of 5 per cent per year and improvements in several human development indicators. we believe that the trend of progress will prevail in the near future, and we will do everything to make it so by investing in future generations on the basis of the objectives of the new partnership for africas development, the post- 2015 road map and the african agenda 2063. angola is implementing its national development plan 2013-2017, which aims to increase the supply of social services to the population, diversify the economy and consolidate macroeconomic stability, thus laying the foundation for the process of graduation to a middle-income country. angola reiterates the need to end the economic and financial embargo imposed on cuba, which limits the right of the cuban people to development and is a clear violation of the principles and rules of international law. finally, we appreciate and have been touched by the support that angola has received from numerous countries for its candidature to be a non-permanent member of the security council for the 2015-2016 biennium, elections for which will place during the assemblys present session. once elected to that important organ, we will work with partners in the council to seek solutions to the serious problems facing the international community and to make a real contribution to peace and security in the world.",Angola,Africa,66.0301132202148,2.93,1375.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,2.181818181818182
LSO,69,2014,"i would first like to congratulate president kutesa on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the general assembly at its sixty-ninth session. his distinguished career as a diplomat and leader assures us of a successful session. i would also like to commend his predecessor, ambassador john ashe, for his remarkable leadership during the previous session. over the 69 years of its existence, the united nations has witnessed several changes in the configuration of international relations. some were traumatic, others benign. the survival of the organization through all those tribulations testifies to its resilience and the enduring validity of its mission. today it is still confronted by serious challenges. the continuous eruption of armed conflicts throughout the world, terrorism, climate change, disease and the lingering effects of the economic and financial crises are only some of the challenges that have remained in the foreground of international relations and preoccupied the international community. from the horn of africa and across the sahel region, to the republic of kenya and the democratic republic of the congo, the continent of africa is facing a rise in terrorism. the nigeria-based boko haram, al-qaida in the islamic maghreb and al-shabaab in somalia continue to pose serious threats to the peace and security of the continent. the emergence in the middle east and elsewhere of new extremist groups and terrorist entities, such as the islamic state in iraq and syria, has not only further compounded the problem but is a stark reminder that we must act collectively to discharge the moral responsibility resting on us to ensure that people everywhere enjoy the right to peace, development and the sanctity of life. the use of military force alone as a strategy for combating terrorism is no longer a panacea for that menace. terrorism requires a holistic approach that addresses the root causes of the scourge. the resolution of international disputes based on dialogue, justice and the equality of all states must be at the heart of that strategy if it is to succeed. the recurring bloody conflict between israel and palestine continues to weigh heavily on the conscience of all humankind. recent developments in that region have cast a shadow on the future that had seemed to hold out the promise of a negotiated settlement. unprecedented impunity and the disproportionate use of force by the parties involved call into question our very claim to be a civilization. turning united nations shelters into combat zones and killing the innocent children, men and women who take refuge in them is a shameful act that must be condemned in the strongest terms possible. lesotho endorses the recent human rights council resolution s-21/1, demanding that the massacres of innocent palestinian civilians be investigated by an independent commission and that those responsible be held accountable. let us not forget that in 2005 we unanimously adopted the principle of the responsibility to protect (see resolution 60/1, paragraphs 138-140) in order to safeguard innocent civilians from war crimes, genocide, mass atrocities and ethnic cleansing. indeed, the security council has reaffirmed that principle in several conflicts around the world and in some instances has authorized military intervention. unfortunately, in the case of the slaughter of thousands of palestinian civilians, the council has shied away from invoking the principle of responsibility to protect. instead, it took comfort in issuing a presidential statement that glaringly fails to reiterate accountability for the war crimes committed. civilians in gaza deserve the protection that israelis in tel aviv are afforded under international law. we call on israel as we have always done in the past to fully comply with its obligations under the relevant security council and general assembly resolutions. that is the only plausible route to lasting peace. the world has long come to terms with the dangers to humanity posed by the possession of weapons of mass destruction. that is why lesotho continues to advocate for total abolition and destruction of all nuclear weapons. those weapons have no place in modern-day civilized society, hence the call for a convention to ban them all. while working towards that goal, we must emphasize that full compliance with the provisions of the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is critical. by the same token, we call for the establishment of a middle east zone free of nuclear weapons, in accordance with the 2010 review conference of the parties to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. it is unacceptable that the united nations of today still reflects the 1945 architecture of the world as seen by the victors of the second world war. the reform of the united nations, including the security council, can no longer be delayed. a reformed, transparent and more democratic united nations is necessary for preserving international peace and security and for confronting the challenges of development. all member states need to garner the necessary political will to advance the intergovernmental negotiations on security council reform. let us make the sixth-ninth session one for decisive action. the representatives who gathered in san francisco to finalize the charter of the united nations dreamed of a world of peace and shared prosperity. they renounced a vision of a world in which some unilaterally imposed economic sanctions and financial blockades against others, or one in which peoples were denied their right to self-determination or were subjected to occupation, as is the case in cuba, palestine and western sahara. we have to remove those dark spots on the history of our time by allowing the letter and spirit of the charter to guide our actions. the theme chosen for our general debate, delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda, could not be more relevant at the current international juncture. the road towards the achievement of all the millennium development goals (mdgs) has been rough, with some countries reporting relative success in reducing poverty and hunger, markedly increasing school enrolment, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health and combating hiv/aids. however, the challenges remain most daunting in the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, some small island developing states and countries in, or emerging from, conflict. for our part, in lesotho we have made some progress towards achieving at least two of the eight mdgs, namely, universal primary education, and promoting gender equality and empowering women. we still face a long and uphill journey to reach a life of dignity for all. hiv and aids still pose a serious threat to us. the untold miseries brought about by that scourge are known to all of us. africa is more vulnerable to that threat because of the worsening poverty and unemployment. sadly, new, incurable pandemics such as ebola have emerged, wreaking havoc in sister african countries and overwhelming their health systems. the world must mobilize resources and energy to help the affected countries of west africa fight the pandemic and to abolish it in the long term. our quest to pursue a sustainable future for all must never wane as we step into the new era and embark on the road map of the post-2015 development agenda. we need to formulate a new set of universal sustainable development goals that are concise and strong with regard to the means of implementation. it is important to emphasize national ownership and respect for national conditions in each member state and to take advantage of global diversity so that we can attain our development aspirations. as we continue with intergovernmental discussions leading up to the third international conference on financing for development, which will be held in addis ababa in july 2015, we must be guided by the spirit of frankness and mutual understanding, without the acrimony that often characterizes our intergovernmental deliberations. it is equally important to emphasize that advancing the rule of law at the national and international levels is essential for realizing sustainable development, eradicating poverty and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms. lesotho is by no means an exception in that regard. a few days ago, the climate summit provided us with an opportunity once again to reaffirm our collective resolve to implement measures that can significantly address climate change. we disagreed for far too long, until we were confronted by the glaring and compelling scientific evidence that the link between global warming and human activity is indisputable. sadly, catastrophes have begun to hit, mostly affecting the poorest and most vulnerable countries. my country is one of the worst affected by climate change. in recent years, lesotho has faced unsettling development challenges due to the effects of climate change. the effects of increasing extreme weather patterns such as early frost, droughts, desertification and degradation of arable land compound the challenges that we are already facing. livelihoods of societies are stifled, and economies and ways of life are negatively affected. while we appreciate that there are resources aimed at helping developing countries to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, we are concerned that such funds are difficult to access. the global climate-finance architecture is complex, with variable structures of governance and modalities. some finance is channelled through multilateral agencies, sometimes even outside the funding mechanisms of the united nations framework convention on climate change, and some flows through bilateral development- assistance institutions, thereby making coordination very difficult. lesotho calls on the international community and our development partners to simplify the accessibility of funds earmarked for climate change initiatives if we are to make an impact on the ground. in conclusion, let me point out that the regime of the charter of the united nations has so far done its part in preventing a third world war, thereby fulfilling one of the dreams of the architects of our beloved organization. the continued success and the relevance of the united nations in the new millennium will depend, in large measure, on its capacity for self-renewal in readiness to meet modern-day challenges. we, the united nations, should continue to be the voice of the voiceless and the best hope for all humankind. now is the time for leaders everywhere to join the race for transformative action that can drive peace, democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law, human dignity, economic competitiveness and sustainable prosperity for all. lesotho will and must continue to be a persistent and resilient part of that initiative.",Lesotho,Africa,76.6352005004883,7.2,1714.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,2.333722287047841
BFA,69,2014,"every year, the general assembly gives us the opportunity to get together to discuss our concerns in the various parts of the world. here we are, meeting again to evaluate what has been accomplished and to consider new solutions to the many challenges confronting our shared responsibility. and burkina faso is committed, as always, to participating in this important get-together, the symbol of international solidarity. i would like to express our gratitude to president kutesas predecessor, ambassador john ashe, for his positive record during his tenure. i also heartily congratulate the president on his election, and i am confident that his wealth of experience with international and development issues will enable him to effectively guide our work on the post-2015 development agenda, in order to formulate an ambitious new framework for development aimed at bringing our peoples growth, fairness and a better life. i would also like to pay tribute to secretary- general ban ki-moon for his thoughtful focus on peace and social and economic development around the world, especially in africa. in that regard, i welcome his initiative in holding last weeks climate summit in new york, aimed at persuading heads of state and government and representatives of local authorities, the private sector and civil society of the urgent and compelling need for them to declare their contributions to the fight against climate change in firm and concrete terms. burkina faso also reiterates its commendation of the joint visit to the sahel by the secretary-general, the chairperson of the african union commission, the president of the world bank, the president of the african development bank and the european commissioner for development within the framework of the united nations integrated strategy for the sahel, which aims to promote security, good governance, development and human rights as factors of peace and stability. lastly, burkina faso welcomes the assemblys adoption of the secretary-generals ebola initiative (resolution 69/1) and welcomes his appointment of mr. david nabarro as senior united nations system coordinator for ebola virus disease and mr. anthony banbury as his special representative and head of the united nations mission on ebola emergency response. these steps will certainly help the west african subregion to strengthen its public-health systems in order to eradicate the epidemic, whose spread could permanently compromise the areas social cohesion, development and economic integration. burkina faso would like to express its sympathy and solidarity with the affected countries, and it reiterates its commitment to participating in the quest for a collective solution that can ensure effective protection for the people and for health personnel, as well as the free movement of people and goods within the economic community of west african states (ecowas). today we can celebrate the progress made in efforts to achieve and maintain peace, as well as to achieve our development goals, despite the fact that there is still work to be done to speed up improvement of our peoples living conditions. in burkina faso, notwithstanding our unfavourable geographical and climatic conditions and a difficult international economic environment, we are committed, with determination and realism, to building development. in the last few decades, therefore, we have established and implemented strategic development programmes and plans designed to put our country firmly on the road to emergence. poverty reduction, the empowerment of women and full employment for young people are some of our main objectives. for several years consecutively those efforts have enabled burkina faso to record average annual growth rates of around 5 per cent and achieve significant investments in a number of areas that include health, education, agriculture, and water, road and energy infrastructures. clearly, development efforts cannot thrive without a stable, peaceful environment. to that end, our president, mr. blaise compaore, and the government of burkina faso continue to work to entrench a culture of tolerance and peaceful coexistence that seeks to establish, through dialogue and consultations, the essential elements of social cohesion, a strengthened democratic process and respect for individual and collective liberties. as a member of the human rights council, burkina faso continues to set a good example by making the promotion and defence of human rights a major focus of its government policy on improving the peoples welfare. that has been the context for the work of mrs. chantal compaore, a goodwill ambassador for the inter-african committee on traditional practices affecting the health of women and children, whose commitment to dealing with the issue of female genital mutilation is an important contribution to global efforts to protect the rights of women and girls. burkina faso welcomes the human rights councils recent adoption of a draft resolution on intensifying global efforts and sharing good practices to effectively eliminate female genital mutilation , submitted by the african group at burkina fasos initiative. we are following with concern the crises and conflicts that unfortunately continue to plague parts of the world, particularly the african continent. however, under the auspices of ecowas, we welcome the significant progress made over recent months in restoring peace and democracy in west africa, especially in guinea-bissau and mali. with respect to mali, ecowas mediation brought about the restoration of constitutional order and the holding of free and fair elections throughout the national territory. for the continuation of the peace process in mali, burkina faso welcomes and supports the efforts of the peoples democratic republic of algeria in the search for a lasting peace solution in accordance with the preliminary agreement signed in ouagadougou on 18 june 2013. that agreements ultimate goal is to restore peace, the territorial integrity of mali and of the ecowas region, and cohesion among all malian communities, in order to achieve the objectives of harmonious development and subregional integration. in mali, as elsewhere in the sahel subregion, armed conflicts are becoming more complex and more radicalized because of the emergence of violent extremism and terrorism closely associated with the criminal economy, which is characterized, inter alia, by trafficking in drugs, weapons and human beings. those evils challenge us in our shared responsibility in the fight to eradicate them. it is more urgent than ever to work together by focusing on preventive measures and addressing their root causes, namely such predisposing factors as extreme poverty, youth unemployment, and the denial of rights and justice. similarly, it is important to strengthen the rapid- response capabilities of our states and international cooperation in the exchange of information, in order to allow our defence forces and security to fight effectively against terrorist threats. in that regard, burkina faso expresses its deep gratitude to all partner countries, especially france and the united states of america, whose contribution to the efforts to secure the sahel is priceless. we would now like to reiterate our total solidarity with and full support for the people and government of the federal republic of nigeria, which continue to face the unprecedented rise of terrorism and religious intolerance. other african countries are also experiencing crisis situations. we are thinking in particular of somalia, libya, the central african republic, the democratic republic of congo and the sudan. with respect to the central african republic, burkina faso salutes the efforts of the international mediator, president sassou nguesso, and welcomes the brazzaville forum, which concluded with an agreement on the cessation of hostilities. my country supports the transitional government, welcomes the effective establishment of the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in the central african republic and reiterates its readiness to contribute to efforts to restore and keep peace in central africa. in the light of all these crises, burkina faso would emphasize the urgent need to restore and maintain an environment of peace and stability in the countries concerned, without which our development and integration efforts will be in vain. in that context, no effort should be spared to protect peacekeepers who risk their lives working to provide security and comfort to civilians. i would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our strong condemnation of intentional attacks against all united nations troops in theatres of peacekeeping. as it always has, burkina faso will continue to participate in the collective action of peacekeeping in countries in difficulty, in particular darfur, mali, guinea-bissau, the democratic republic of the congo and haiti. we express our deep appreciation to partner countries for their various forms of support in terms of training and equipment, which allow burkinabe troops to accomplish their tasks efficiently wherever they are sent. with respect to conflict resolution, burkina faso advocates dialogue and consultation, which is the basis for burkina fasos consistent action when the president of our country is sought after as a mediator or facilitator. accordingly, i welcome the adoption on 31 july by the assembly of resolution 68/303 on strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes, conflict prevention and resolution. in that regard, my country, a member of the group of friends of mediation, encourages the actions taken under the leadership of finland and turkey. with regard to western sahara, burkina faso welcomes the moroccan initiative for advanced autonomy status in western sahara, which is a credible and realistic option for achieving a final solution acceptable to all. in the middle east, we condemn the recent escalation of violence which has led to many casualties among civilian populations. priority should be given to dialogue, and we hope that the unrestricted ceasefire that was signed between palestinians and israelis on 26 august 2014, under the auspices of the arab republic of egypt, will lead to the establishment of a definitive peace between the two parties to the conflict. accordingly, burkina faso welcomes the efforts of the international community aimed at creating a palestinian state living side by side with israel in peace, security and mutual respect. the establishment of international peace and security will be but hollow words as long as the issue of disarmament remains unresolved. therefore, no sacrifice is too great if together we can achieve a world free of nuclear weapons, a reduction in the risk of the proliferation of conventional weapons, and the entry into force and universalization of the arms trade treaty. to establish a permanent basis for peace, security and freedom, it is also necessary to create the conditions for sustainable and equitable development for all peoples. that is why my country reaffirms its strong commitment to the achievement of the millennium development goals. we therefore have a deep interest in the development process under way for the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda, and we urge that special attention be given to vital sectors such as agriculture, renewable energy, industrialization and infrastructure. burkina faso reaffirms its commitment to the ideals of the united nations based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, dialogue and peaceful settlement of disputes. it is with conviction that we welcome and strongly encourage the rapprochement of views between the peoples republic of china and the republic of china on taiwan and the dialogue that forms the basis for such an approach. we favour the wider participation of the republic of china on taiwan in the specialized agencies of the united nations. we salute the spirit of understanding displayed by the international community in allowing the involvement of that country in international organizations in order to enable it to play a broader role on the world stage through its contribution to the achievement of development goals, particularly in countries like burkina faso. readmitting the republic of china on taiwan to our organization is worth considering. with 23 million inhabitants and a large economy, the republic of china on taiwan has established itself as a key player in the international arena in terms of promoting peace and contributing to development efforts. with regard to cuba, burkina faso reiterates its position in favour of lifting the embargo in order to allow the cuban people to fit harmoniously into the concert of nations. convinced of the irreplaceable role of the united nations in promoting multilateralism, my country supports the reforms under consideration, in particular those of the security council and the general assembly. given the nature of the new factors in the threats to international peace and security, it is necessary and equitable that other continents have permanent seats on the security council. that is why burkina faso endorses the african common position in favour of expanding the number of permanent members of the security council to take into account the expectations of the african continent. with everyones help and moved by a spirit of solidarity and sharing, we can strengthen the role of the united nations as a genuine instrument of cooperation for peace, security, justice and development.",Burkina Faso,Africa,34.5993995666504,4.053299903869629,2095.0,6.0,0.0,6.0,2.863961813842482
GIN,69,2014,"fourteen years ago, in this very hall, the international community, in a promising move, pledged to attain a series of common goals by 2015, essentially, to eradicate poverty and achieve a prosperous and shared world in a secure environment. now, one year before that deadline, we must recognize that humankind has not been able to create all the conditions necessary for the development we aspire to. the very foundations of our organization are likely to be shaken if steps are not taken to deal with the immense challenges facing us. poverty always goes hand in hand with major pandemics, undermining any glimmer of hope for the decent life to which our people are entitled. humankinds aggressiveness towards the environment pushes it out of the balance that is essential for its growth and for sustainable development. fundamental rights are still being trampled on, opening the door to intolerance, frustrations and social crises. peace and security are faltering in many countries, threatening more than ever the stability of our planet. it is clear that only a comprehensive and cooperative approach will lead us to a society free of the defects that prevent true progress. in congratulating the president of the assembly on his election, we would like to state that he is without a doubt contributing to the momentum for a new global partnership, which we have all been hoping for and which is so crucial. today, we wish to assure him that we will provide him with the same kind of unfailing support that we provided to his predecessor, ambassador john ashe, to whom we pay tribute for his leadership in seeking solutions to our issues of concern. i must address the issue of the serious health and humanitarian crisis that sierra leone, liberia and guinea are currently facing. as members know, the ebola virus, a disease characterized by haemorrhagic fever, continues to threaten international security. since its most recent appearance in march 2014, it has caused over 2,500 deaths and continues to cause victims. health-care workers have not been spared. faced with the spread of the epidemic, an extraordinary summit of heads of state and government of the mano river union was held in conakry on 1 august. the summit adopted a common strategy for fighting the disease and made an urgent appeal to the international community for a coordinated global response. at the national level, my government declared a health emergency on 13 august. the quarantine line was reinforced by the establishment of compulsory medical checks at all border crossings and crossing places in the country, in particular airports and ports. the negative impact of the ebola virus on the countrys economy can be seen in the decrease in trade, productivity and activity in the transport, investment and tourism sectors. to date, guinea has suffered a loss of nearly 2.5 per cent in the growth forecast for gross domestic product. that loss could increase if adequate measures are not taken in time to stem the epidemic. there have been other adverse consequences for the affected countries, in particular in terms of borders being closed, the free movement of persons hindered, flights cancelled and nationals of the states affected by the disease stigmatized. the ebola epidemic reminds us of the urgent need for a comprehensive approach to contain and defeat this terrible disease. we must isolate ebola, not countries. we must counter the irrational panic that has gripped the world. ebola is a very serious epidemic, but it is not a death sentence. ebola can be cured. we therefore welcome the fact that several african heads of state have joined president ibrahim boubacar keita of mali and the king of morocco, to whom i pay tribute, and france and england, as president alassane ouattara of cote divoire, president teodoro obiang nguema mbasogo of equatorial guinea, president denis sassou nguesso of the republic of congo and president ali bongo ondimba of gabon have decided to lift the ban on flights and the use of airports. i thank them. in my capacity as acting chair of the mano river union, i would like to welcome the appointment of the united nations system senior coordinator for ebola virus disease and pay tribute to the work of the world health organization, the united states centers for disease control in atlanta, medecins sans frontieres, the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies and other bilateral and multilateral partners who are sparing no effort to support coordinated action by the affected countries to eradicate the ebola virus. my government welcomes with genuine satisfaction security council resolution 2177 (2014), which was co-sponsored by 134 member states and adopted unanimously by the members of the council, and resolution 69/1, on the establishment of a united nations mission for ebola emergency response. i welcome the spirit of solidarity that continues to be shown to the countries affected by the epidemic and express our gratitude to all states and organizations that have assisted us. i thank in particular president obama, president francois hollande and the secretary- general for their support and their call to action to all the countries of the world. our countries have urgent needs that must be met to further boost our efforts to fight effectively against ebola. those needs are in a variety of areas, including strengthening our infrastructure and health systems and increasing the number of health-care workers and financial, material and logistical support, as the gaps in those areas inhibit our efforts. promises are nice, but there is an urgent need for action on the ground. the faster we act, the better chance we have of stopping the disease. sustainable development remains the cornerstone of the harmonious development of humankind. the international community has an obligation to end the poverty that still grips almost 2 billion people, most of whom live in africa. beyond the economic and social concerns, it is a matter of human dignity. it is a matter of justice and fairness. we therefore do not have the right to back off, much less to give up. certainly, progress has been made, if unevenly, towards achieving the millennium development goals. illiteracy has been pushed back, although efforts are still needed to achieve the quality and equality required in the pursuit of knowledge. the essential role of women in transforming society has been further enhanced. however, family health and access to water, basic health care and social protection deserve further investment and political commitment. worse, the digital divide has been slow to show any improvement, for lack of an adequate policy of ownership or transfers of science and new technologies. however, encouraging results have been achieved in the fight against malaria and hiv/aids despite the spectre of the disease, which still haunts the lives of millions of people who do not have access to antiretroviral medicine. the many challenges facing our world require an urgent, comprehensive and coordinated response. in the collective quest for well-being, africa in particular has seen renewed growth, but it is having difficulty in translating that growth into a true engine for development. eradicating poverty is an uphill battle. the new africa that we aspire to should promote structural changes that enable it to acquire robust and diversified economies so as to guarantee reinvestment in value-added and environmentally friendly industries in future. in that context, the climate summit held on the sidelines of the current session has provided hope that a binding agreement will be adopted at the international conference to be held in paris in 2015. it goes without saying that those measures will build on the foundation of a vibrant private sector that is underpinned by strong institutions that guarantee good governance, which is itself the crucible of inclusive development. that is why, despite the backdrop of a relentless systemic crisis and the scarcity of external resources because of unfulfilled commitments, africa will be able to enter into the international system, gain confidence and increase intra-african trade to influence the flow of world trade. that is also why our continent will, relying primarily on its own strength and that is extremely important be able to become less vulnerable and build resilience through coherent strategies and the search for innovative financing to accelerate its full potential. recognizing all those challenges, guinea has made a decisive commitment to promoting democracy and the rule of law, which are the foundation for sustainable development. in doing so, since our assumption of the countrys leadership in 2010 we have taken measures that affect all areas of our national life. the reform of the defence and security sector ensures that our armed forces are at the service of the republic and increases their participation in the development process and in peacekeeping in the world. the independence of the judiciary is now ensured. our stabilized and competitive macroeconomic framework strengthens guineas credibility at the international level. guinea has been admitted to the extractive industries transparency initiative and today has one of the most attractive mining codes. even better, the review of all contracts allows us to make the environment safer for investors and ensures a development process that benefits guineans while preserving our ecosystem. of course, the development of the mining sector will rely on promoting agriculture to ensure our food security and to pass on to future generations the resources needed to shape to the world they hope for. the growth we aspire to will be even more promising as it creates decent jobs for our youth and empowers women two sectors of society that constitute the rich and inexhaustible source of all progress. our unquenchable desire to ensure the well-being of our people can be fulfilled only in a stable environment that is free from crises and conflicts. multilateralism, which is the only way to realize our goals, is imperative, since our states, whether big or small, strong or weak, are determined to contribute to building a more just and equitable global society within a reformed united nations that is responsive to the needs of humanity. in that context, africa, the continent that is the most affected, will shoulder its responsibilities by pooling its efforts through greater regional integration, which is an essential element of a global partnership leading to a more dynamic and pragmatic peace. that is why we must be more involved in the struggle against terrorism, extremism and intolerance and the illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons, which fuel cross-border crime and maritime insecurity the numerous scourges that hinder development. the time has come to be the true builders of our destiny. the rule of law, respect for all human rights and good governance remain intangible realities that we must promote. likewise, the implementation of the african peace and security architecture and the ability of africa to respond quickly to crises will strengthen our credibility with regard to stabilizing the continent. i should like to stress in particular the unacceptable suffering that our palestinian brothers are experiencing. guinea has always clearly and unambiguously expressed its unconditional solidarity with the just palestinian cause and firmly condemns the heinous acts committed by israel in the gaza strip, which is now suffering under the yoke of a cruel and vile embargo. my country remains convinced that any viable and lasting solution to the situation in the middle east hinges on the creation of two states living side by side within secure and internationally recognized borders, based on the pre-1967 borders. we will soon have the opportunity to take stock of the millennium development goals. on the eve of that meeting and bearing in mind that we decided, at our sixty-eighth session, to set the stage for the sustainable development goals, it is clear that the implementation of those legitimate goals remains dependent both on the appropriate means for its implementation and on whether the priorities of poor countries, in particular african countries, are taken into account. that is why guinea, which has a member on the secretary-generals high-level panel of eminent persons on the post-2015 development agenda, calls for greater attention to be given to the african common position on the post-2015 development agenda. that is all the more relevant since, if africa does well, the world will do better. the new africa more ambitious and more promising and aware of its human and economic potential is now ready to assume its responsibilities. i again thank secretary-general ban ki-moon, who has devoted all his actions and energy into forging an adequate response on the part of the united nations to all the challenges we face. he deserves our gratitude and respect. there is no doubt that his efforts will chart the course for the indispensable reform of the international system, so that the united nations will be true to its original objectives of promoting peace and security and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in a world of democracy, equity and progress for all.",Guinea,Africa,32.0038414001465,2.422810077667236,2147.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,2.328830926874709
RWA,69,2014,"i want to start by congratulating you, sir, on your election as president of the general assembly. we are living through a period of unprecedented progress in human development. the success of the millennium development goals framework demonstrates that international cooperation remains strong, though we wish the expected results would come faster. even on climate change, if the public and private sectors work together to increase investment in scientific research, we can look forward to a future where countries no longer have to choose between green energy and economic growth. while we work on building peace and well-being in africa, crises elsewhere in the world have aroused grave concern. efforts to address them seem to have little effect, and in some cases they may even make things worse. two critically important public goods have been consistently undervalued by the international system in its approach to conflict resolution and peacebuilding. they are physical security and national identity. when security breaks down, the human costs are enormous. extremists and opportunists are empowered. citizens lose faith in public institutions, as grievances are settled in the street. as a result, sustainable gains in good governance cannot be made. it takes time and patience to build a better political system. there are no shortcuts. we are dealing with real people who want change, but with continuity and safety. they must be fully included in the process of consensus-building. that is because structures of governance that are not developed from within will not take root. we should encourage full ownership and partnership, and the approach of international institutions and member states should take those realities into account. in countries that have known only peace, such arguments may sound self-serving. but they are not, because lives are at stake. the second neglected element is national identity. that is just as important. to manage the diversity in our societies, politics must be national in scope. whatever differences we may have, our common citizenship is a bond that unites us. the negative experiences of nationalism have created doubt about affirming patriotism and national identity. however, what we see around the world today is that national identities are too weak, not that they are too strong. as a result, ethnicity, region and religion become the dominant currency of politics, and nations are torn apart. international systems should encourage efforts by governments and civil society to strengthen national unity. in rwanda, we have focused on building accountable governance institutions and renewing our dignity as a nation. as a result, rwandans today are among the most optimistic and civic-minded people in the world. for us, stability is not an abstraction, it is a reality that abides in the minds and hearts of the people and the institutions they build to sustain it. once achieved, the horizon expands from poverty reduction to wealth creation and the attainment of ever higher measures of human development. therefore, our task in the international community is not to manage conflicts, but to help prevent and end those conflicts. if we focus on keeping people safe and bringing them together to solve their problems, we will be able to do so.",Rwanda,Africa,70.8041305541992,4.19644021987915,523.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
MUS,69,2014,"the year 2015 will be a crucial one for the united nations and the international community. in the coming year, we will reach the deadline for achieving the millennium development goals and adopt a post-2015 development agenda, which will include our sustainable development goals. in 2015, we should adopt a new, legally binding global climate agreement. and the international community will also commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the united nations. at this juncture, we have to ask ourselves to what extent we have achieved the ideals set out in the charter of the united nations, and what is still to be done. we must also ask to what extent the institutional framework laid down almost 70 years ago is still valid today. inequality, both among and within nations, is still a matter for great concern. in spite of the constant references to the rule of law at national and international levels, we still do not always have the possibility of recourse to machinery adequate to resolving legal disputes between states. within the united nations itself, the principle of equality is not always honoured, whether in its constitutional framework or in practice. the twin pillars of peace and security, on the one hand, and development, on the other, as established by the charter, have been undermined by the ascendancy of political issues at the expense of those of development, which are still often seen largely in terms of safeguarding dominant interests rather than from a perspective of global cooperation. inequality and vulnerability are increasing in rich and poor countries alike. unemployment, precarious employment, lack of social protection, access to human development services and financial services are still matters of universal concern. the post-2015 development agenda cannot be only about human rights civil, political, economic at the national level; it must also ensure that the right to development is upheld at the international level. as we work on a new, comprehensive development agenda, we must ensure that no right is ignored and no one is left behind. the united nations system task team on the post-2015 united nations development agenda has proposed that the transformative efforts to achieve inclusive, people-centred sustainable development be guided by three fundamental principles human rights, equality and sustainability and have four core dimensions: inclusive social development, environmental sustainability, inclusive economic development and peace and security. mauritius is in broad agreement with those core principles and dimensions, as outlined in the teams report realizing the future we want for all, for guiding this transformation at both the national and international levels. the war against ebola demands robust action from all of us and requires exceptional international cooperation. we welcome the initiatives announced last week, and we commit ourselves to giving our full support to addressing this global challenge. the water we drink, the food we eat and the energy we require are vital to meaningful development. it is estimated that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two thirds of the worlds population could be living under water-stress conditions. one in eight people in the world today 842 million are undernourished. approximately 2 billion suffer from micronutrient deficiencies. in 2030, it is estimated that food demand will have increased by more than 50 per cent. in that regard, mauritius supports the secretary-generals call for a zero hunger challenge. promoting sustainable agriculture must therefore be an essential component of the new development framework. it is also estimated that by 2035, global energy demand will have increased by at least 33 per cent. currently, 1.2 billion people have no access to electricity. those growing demands will make water, food and energy crucial issues not only on the development agenda but also in the wider context of international peace and security. the international community should support developing countries, particularly vulnerable countries such as small island developing states (sids), in their efforts to promote water governance and integrated water resources management, increase the share of renewables in the energy mix and improve energy conservation and efficiency. in order to support global development, it is crucial that we have an international regime based on structured global cooperation designed to promote technology facilitation, and a technology facilitation mechanism established under the auspices of the united nations could play a central role in that regard. it is also important that the international community recognize the vital role of women and young people and their enhanced participation and leadership in all areas of sustainable development. promoting gender equality and womens empowerment should be a core issue on the post-2015 development agenda. all sections of the population should be at the heart of a people-centred vision of sustainable development. the contributions of all the initiatives launched at the 2012 united nations conference on sustainable development (rio+20), including the open working group for sustainable development goals, the intergovernmental committee of experts on sustainable development financing, and options for a technology facilitation mechanism, should feed into the preparations for a 2015 development summit. they should also be included in the secretary-generals synthesis report. the deliberations of the third international conference on small island developing states, mandated by the rio+20 outcome document (resolution 66/288, annex), should be reflected in the synthesis report and the post-2015 development agenda. since accountability is essential to assessing progress, the post-2015 development agenda should also include an accountability framework that would be universal but flexible enough to take into account different capacities and responsibilities. and we need more accountable and equitable global economic governance that ensures wider, more inclusive participation in decision-making. the united nations, given its universal membership, should assume leadership and a proactive role in promoting sound and equitable governance in a more resilient global economic architecture. beyond those immediate concerns, there are a number of longer-term threats that may dramatically affect all of us, particularly sids. one of them is climate change. climate risks are real and must be addressed. from melting glaciers to more frequent wildfires and intense cyclones, flash floods, extreme heatwaves and ocean acidification, the challenges are not a future threat; they already exist. the latest report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, climate change 2014: impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability, made it clear that an increase in the worlds temperature of 2c would be dangerous, while one of 4c would be catastrophic. climate risks are global challenges that require global solutions. climate change poses risks to global economic prosperity, development and security as well as to the environment. we must build on the momentum of the climate summit and use the opportunity of the 20th session of the conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, to be held in lima, to raise the level of ambition in the lead-up to a new universal climate agreement in paris next year. the strong connections between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction should be recognized. no country is immune to natural disasters, but it is the most vulnerable countries and people who are hit the hardest. mauritius looks forward to a renewed and ambitious international framework for disaster risk management that establishes disaster risk reduction as a key element of the post-2015 development agenda. we also believe that the exogenous risks of climate change and natural disasters should be integrated into mainstream economic thinking and assessment of macroeconomic risks. we welcome the decision of the most recent commonwealth heads of government meeting to establish a commonwealth climate finance skills hub, to be hosted by mauritius. it will address critical gaps in building the capacity of sids and least-developed countries to identify, access and manage climate finance. the special circumstances, vulnerabilities and low resilience of sids should be taken into account with regard to financing and trade issues. sids need special and differential treatment to access concessionary sources of financing for sustainable development and to effectively participate in multilateral trade. mauritius strongly supports sids-sids partnerships. sids can build on their commonality of interests to share experiences, pool resources and act collectively in commissioning technology or formulating legal and regulatory frameworks, for instance. the oceans are the new frontier for economic development. for sids in particular, they are the best scope for expanding economic space. following a national dialogue on the ocean economy, the government of mauritius has published the road map for the mauritian ocean economy. the road map sets out the vision, goals and strategies for the development and expansion of a new pillar of our economy. in order to provide the best possible conditions for investors to operate and create wealth, mauritius is putting in place an enabling environment that will support our ocean economy through an integrated and holistic approach to ensure coherence and balance among economic growth, social development and environmental protection. promoting the ocean economy will unleash the potential for sids with respect to all ocean-related economic activities, both onshore and offshore. it will also enable them to enhance their nations food security, harness the winds and waves for their energy needs, develop new ocean-related industries and services that will create opportunities for entrepreneurs and youth employment. it is essential that we strike a balance between the various uses of the oceans and the need to protect our oceans. at the third international conference on small island developing states, held in samoa, the international community agreed to build upon existing partnerships and promote new ones in order to expand the economic space of large ocean states. we wish to reiterate our call for the united nations to adopt a global oceans strategy that will be the operational counterpart to the united nations convention on the law of the sea (unclos). while it will be for individual states to decide on their own ocean economy policies, the global ocean strategy will provide an overall vision and framework for the sustainable development of ocean- related economic activities for policymakers, investors and all stakeholders. the situation in the middle east and in certain parts of africa could not only have dramatic consequences for the people of these regions, but also impact on global development and peace. we urge the international community to spare no effort in resolving the plight of the people of palestine. mauritius supports the two- state solution to the conflict. the people of the state of palestine have suffered for too long from the grave injustice done to them, and must be allowed to live in dignity and peace within recognized borders. if it is to remain credible and play the constructive role it can and must play in the new world order, the united nations must respond to the call of its membership for reform. we have a duty to engage in meaningful discussions on the reform of the security council, the revitalization of the general assembly and the working methods of our organization. mauritius reaffirms its commitment to the african common position that reform of the security council should include expansion in the permanent and non-permanent categories alike. the historical injustice done to africa should be redressed, and africa should be accorded permanent representation on the council. latin america also deserves permanent representation, and the sids should be entitled to a seat on the council. mauritius further reiterates its support for indias rightful aspiration to a permanent seat in a reformed security council. in the mid-1960s, when a wave of decolonization was sweeping across the world, the united kingdom purported to create a new colony, the so-called british indian ocean territory, by carving out part of the territory of mauritius. thus, part of mauritian territory remains under colonial rule. as long as part of mauritian territory remains under colonial rule, the decolonization of africa will still remain incomplete. the dismemberment by the united kingdom of part of the territory of mauritius prior to independence was and continues to be a blatant breach of international law and total disregard of united nations resolutions. speaking before the assembly last week, president obama said that there was one vision of the world in which might makes right [but that] america stands for something different. we believe that right makes might, that bigger nations should not be able to bully smaller ones (a/69/pv.6, p. 10). this is why, last year in this very forum (see a/68/pv.18), mauritius urged the united states to be on the right side of history, and not condone illegal acts by maintaining its presence on diego garcia under an unlawful arrangement with the united kingdom that has no valid title to the island, but and instead to ensure that, in the future, the united states presence is on the right side of the law. both the united states and the united kingdom should recognize the sovereignty of mauritius over the chagos archipelago, and engage in meaningful discussions with mauritius in good faith over arrangements to be made in that regard. following the statements we have heard over the past year with regard to sovereignty and territorial integrity, there should not be one set of standards for one part of the world and a different one for another part of the world. those who show no respect for fundamental principles across the board lose all moral authority to preach to the rest of the world. following bilateral discussions on tromelin, which forms an integral part of the territory of mauritius, mauritius and france agreed on interim measures without prejudice to the sovereignty of mauritius. an agreement reached in a spirit of cooperation and dialogue is a step in the right direction. as we embark on a new session that could herald a new chapter in the history of the united nations, we should renew our commitment to multilateral cooperation for peace, development and prosperity for all nations in the new agenda to be adopted next year.",Mauritius,Africa,92.4747619628906,4.815149784088135,2300.0,12.0,0.0,12.0,5.217391304347826
BDI,69,2014,"on behalf of his excellency mr. pierre nkurunziza, president of burundi, and the people of burundi as a whole, i would first like to offer warm congratulations to you, sam kutesa, a son of africa, for your election by acclamation on 11 june as president of the general assembly at its current session. i would also like to acknowledge the remarkable work of his excellency mr. john ashe, who presided over the assembly at its sixty-eighth session, which he closed in this newly renovated hall. and i take this opportunity to reiterate our gratitude to secretary-general ban ki-moon for his untiring efforts to improve the functioning of the organization and for the results attained in a particularly difficult socioeconomic context. at this important moment, when delegations from many different parts of the globe have come together, we would like to express our appreciation for the theme of the sixty-ninth session, delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda. it comes at just the right time, since we are slowly but surely and inexorably approaching the deadline for achieving the millennium development goals (mdgs). beyond that, i would also like to welcome the priorities that you have already set, mr. president, which focus on eradicating poverty and hunger and promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth. as the authors of the report of the high-level group established to make recommendations on the post- 2015 development programme put it, the theme chosen and your priorities are simultaneously ambitious and pragmatic. the report cites intense discussions in every region and in many sectors, especially on those living in poverty. the same team fosters the hope that our generation will be able to produce the transformations needed to end the poverty that is devastating people all over our planet. we should therefore emphasize that however ambitious the groups recommendations may be, they should also take into account the realities on the ground and the fact that the transformative changes linked to the goals and indicative targets those coming out of discussions with 5,000 civil society organizations, 250 leaders of major businesses and the scientific and academic communities, along with national, regional and international consultations can contribute to reducing hunger and poverty around the world by generating tangible economic growth that can be equitably shared in order to achieve the well-being we seek. the millennium development goals were a pact of global socioeconomic solidarity for our countries. like other nations in africa and elsewhere, burundi has great respect for those goals. as the aforementioned group has rightly pointed out, the fastest reduction in poverty in the history of the world occurred during the first 13 years of the new millennium. the same group notes that the number of people living on $1.25 a day has fallen, and child mortality has declined by 30 per cent since the 2000 millennium declaration (resolution 55/2), while deaths attributable to malaria have been reduced by one quarter. while we should note that not every country can boast the same progress, burundi shares the belief that it would be wrong for us to abandon the mdgs and start over at zero. on the contrary, we should continue the reforms that have produced the unprecedented progress, which is unquestionably the result of improved policies and commitment on a global scale aimed at meeting the millennium development goals. we should therefore capitalize on them in order to profit further. we also subscribe to the other declared priorities, including the adoption of a post-2015 development agenda, the strengthening of cooperation and reforming the united nations, as well as strengthening partnerships between the united nations and other bodies. although at the moment it seems clear that burundi will not be able to fully meet the established goals, i should point out that we have made undeniable progress in the areas of education and health, thanks in particular to our programmes of free education and medical care for children under five and new mothers. besides the 3,000 classrooms and many health centres built over the past few years, we have seen positive results in other sectors, too. in the area of education, many young burundians, including girls, who had no access to schooling in the past are now attending school. in the area of health care, we have reduced child and maternal mortality, and we are working on stabilizing the prevalence of hiv/aids and meeting the eligibility requirements for the global fund to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria. we delivered accounts of those efforts at the assemblys sixty-eighth session, as well as of the reduction of deaths due to malaria. on the political front, as we indicated in our address to the assembly at the sixty-eighth session, burundi has been working on the process we committed to months ago for holding presidential and general elections, scheduled to begin in may 2015. in that regard, it is important to note that after the holding of successive elections in 2005 and 2010, with support from the united nations and other partners, the entire political class, through the leaders of the authorized political parties and other parties, agreed in march 2013 on a road map for the next elections. in that regard, one must add that, thanks to that extremely valuable instrument, which should help the burundian political parties in the holding of transparent, free and democratic elections, the burundian parliament adopted the electoral code by consensus. subsequently, the head of state promulgated it, as prescribed by our constitution, which is the fruit of the arusha agreement of 2000, to which burundi attaches great importance. moreover, the electoral calendar was announced last june by the independent national electoral commission, itself established after consultations and agreement among the political parties involved in the matter. we can therefore say that things are moving and progressing well in my country. i also wish to reaffirm loud and clear what the head of state, his excellency pierre nkurunziza, often reiterates, that the 2015 elections will be held in better conditions than previous elections and that success will be complete. the burundian people have suffered so much from the violence that has plunged many families into mourning that we cannot afford to relapse into the errors of the past. indeed, we made the firm commitment to bury the hatchet once and for all. that is why we have made our own the words of former indian politician mahatma gandhi: i object to violence because when it appears to do good, the good is only temporary; the evil it does is permanent. with regard to good governance, my delegation would like to return to the institutions established during the current legislature session. the tools for improving good governance include the national independent human rights commmission and the institution of the ombudsman, whose performance is deemed satisfactory by many of our compatriots. a national strategy on good governance and on the fight against poverty for 2011-2015 has been adopted and is being implemented. of course, we are far from achieving the expected results, but in burundi and elsewhere it is a long- term undertaking. what is important is that there is the political will to always move forward and meet the challenge of zero tolerance in this area eventually. in addition, performance contracts have been signed by members of the government and by the senior government officials in order to improve the functioning of our administration. the establishment of the burundi revenue authority has improved state revenues and reduced corruption, which was also once a common practice in our tax administration and business circles. here too, one must point out that perfection is not yet at hand, but there is the determination and the will to resolve the scourge of corruption for good. as for the truth and recon.iliation commission envisaged by the arusha peace and reconciliation accord, the relevant law has already been passed by parliament. consultations are under way to elect its 11 commissioners, on the understanding that the filing of nominations was closed in july 2014, and an ad hoc committee for the selection of candidates has just been set up by general consensus. concerning the participation of women in political life, we have strengthened the number of women in the countrys institutions, even going beyond the constitutional provisions in that area. the burundian delegation provided the figures in its statement last year. with respect to the peacebuilding programme in burundi, the coordination mechanisms, such as the coordination group of partners, hold their meetings through appropriate structures, such as clusters, strategic forums and policy forums. the same is true for the coordination of assistance, for which burundi adopted the same structures. the mandate of the united nations office in burundi will end on 31 december, and the office will transfer its responsibilities to a united nations country team in burundi, preparations for which are in full swing. a joint transition programme was presented to the appropriate body on 14 may in the united nations office. also, a joint steering committee and a technical transition team were established and are functioning according to their mandate. finally, also in the context of peace consolidation, a third phase of that programme, coverning the period 2014 to 2016, will soon become operational. the themes of the programme have already been adopted by the relevant authorities. on the economic front, burundi has held two sectoral conferences on priority areas, one in july 2013 and the other in october. their purpose was to decide, together with bilateral partners, on ways and means to implement the commitments made by each at the conference of burundis development partners held in geneva in october 2012. the areas deemed priorities were drawn from two strategic instruments: the burundi vision 2025 and the strategic framework for growth and the fight against corruption, second generation. the first instrument is for long-term development planning and projects burundis image in 2025. it should guide policies and strategies for sustainable development from the perspective of meeting the needs of present generations without hampering or compromising future generations. the second instrument the strategic framework for growth and the fight against poverty, second generation is anchored in vision 2025. it is the unifying framework for all sectoral and multisectoral policies, breaking the strategic pillars of the vision burundi 2025 down into projects and programmes. the results obtained in the economic sphere are rather mixed. that is why the government would again like to make an urgent appeal from this rostrum to the partners represented here that they honour the commitments made at the geneva conference of 2012. regarding burundis post-2015 development programme, the following areas have been identified. they are: governance, inequalities, conflicts and fragility; economic growth and employment; energy, water and environmental sustainability; access to basic social services; and population dynamics and food security. that agenda was the result of an extensive national consultation that included all segments of the population. on its face, it can be seen to be a programme rooted in the continuity of change, well grounded in the transformative development of the lives of our people and consistent with the theme for this session of the assembly. even if regional integration does not seem to be explicitly laid out in the programme, i would like to convey to all present that regional integration is a matter to which burundi is firmly committed and which it considers to be a common thread linking the various policy areas, with the potential to provide appropriate responses to the challenges that our country faces. at the international level, conflicts continue to tear a number of countries apart and to undermine development efforts in many others. we must mobilize our energies and work in synergy to end and eliminate such threats as terrorism, transnational organized crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and others. in that regard, burundi is striving, as much as possible, to do its part to help maintain peace and security in the world. burundi was one of two countries in africa and the world that decided to intervene in somalia as part of the african union mission in 2008, and we continue to strive to contribute to the stabilization of that country to this day. in that regard, burundi is proud of the progress made towards normalization in somali, which promises a better future for somalia. however, the success achieved should not obscure the enormous challenges still facing somalia. burundi is committed to working with the other partners to address them. burundi has also participated in peacekeeping operations in other countries, including the central african republic, cote divoire, haiti, the sudan and syria, to name but a few. with regard to mali, we are greatly satisfied that territorial integrity has been restored in that country and that the presidential elections held there were a success. regarding the conflict in the middle east, burundi, like other members of the international community, is deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in the region observed in recent weeks. that is why we urge all parties to stop armed attacks, to avoid the loss of human life and to seek negotiated settlements to their disputes. finally, with regard to the ebola crisis, we, like other african countries, are very concerned about the rapid spread of the ebola virus, as was vividly described by many representatives during the security council meeting of 18 september (see s/pv.7268). we congratulate the council on its adoption on 18 september of resolution 2177 (2014) on the ebola crisis, at the initiative of the united states of america. my delegation is proud to have sponsored the resolution, along with 134 other states, early in its development. with regard to south sudan, we urgently call on all parties to the conflict to break the cycle of violence and resolve their differences through political dialogue. in that connection, we are pleased to announce that burundi has promised an infantry battalion of 850 men to help that young state to restore peace and security. i also wish to inform the assembly that burundi has made progress regarding the implementation of the millennium development goals (mdgs) in general and in the areas of education and health in particular. however, despite my countrys efforts to accelerate actions to honour the commitments made at the millennium summit in 2000, the international economic climate, and that in burundi in particular, has not been favourable for their attainment. the government of burundi remains committed, however, to the development goals programme and will continue to work beyond 2015 to redouble its efforts to safeguard and strengthen the principles and values contained in the millennium declaration (resolution 55/2), which is a solid foundation for the post-2015 development programme.",Burundi,Africa,61.5134887695312,7.516380045347681,2441.0,10.0,0.0,10.0,4.096681687832856
ZWE,69,2014,"allow me to congratulate mr. kutesa on assuming the presidency of the general assembly at its sixty-ninth session. we are indeed proud of the honour that has been bestowed upon the african continent as a result of his election. the theme he has chosen for this session, that is, delivering on and implementing a transformative post-2015 development agenda, is pertinent, appropriate and timely. it is relevant in our efforts to achieve a seamless transition from the millennium development goals to the sustainable development goals and the broader post- 2015 development agenda. we look forward to having a candid and comprehensive debate on the challenges we continue to face at the domestic and international levels in our efforts to eradicate poverty. the millennium development goals (mdgs) helped to focus and mobilize global development efforts in order to achieve progress in the social sectors. however, despite the significant achievements within the framework of the mdgs, progress was uneven between goals, among regions and within countries. consequently, we cannot remain complacent when some sections of the global community are marginalized or even left behind. we are therefore gratified that the proposed sustainable development goals have taken on board the unfinished business of the millennium development goals. part of that unfinished business concerns the critical issue of poverty eradication, which remains the greatest global challenge. that issue should therefore be the top priority and overarching objective of the development agenda for the future. we in the southern african development community share the view that the post-mdg agenda must be informed by national development priorities and that the new targets must better reflect local conditions. in that regard, zimbabwe adopted its own economic blueprint, the zimbabwe agenda for sustainable socio- economic transformation. it is a bold and achievable development programme that has the objective of ensuring inclusive economic growth, decent jobs for all, affordable and reliable energy, food security, sustainable agriculture and the development of reliable modern infrastructure. through the programme, we also aim to expand the industrial base, which is key to the sustained overall economic development and human development of our country. we continue to push for the leveraging of our diverse and abundant resources through beneficiation and value addition. we therefore expect that the proposals in the sustainable development goals, which complement those elements of our national aspirations, will be endorsed and integrated into the post-2015 development agenda framework. social justice, political stability and sustainable development in african countries can best be achieved through genuine and committed support for the ownership of means of production that favour the poor, who are in the majority. in zimbabwe, my government has gone a long way in laying the foundation for sustained food production through our land reform programme. the majority of the rural people have been empowered to contribute to household and national food security. the possession and exploitation of land has also turned them into masters of their own destiny, thus giving true meaning to our national independence and unquestioned sovereignty. because zimbabwe has thus been preoccupied with the empowerment of its people economically, it has become a victim of the evil machinations of western countries, namely, the united states and states members of the european union, which continue to apply unilateral and illegal sanctions as a foreign-policy tool to achieve short-term political objectives, particularly regime change. regime change is a diabolical and illegal policy of interference in the domestic affairs of my country, and no good can come from undermining our economy or depriving our citizens of the necessities of life. why, i ask, should zimbabweans continue to suffer under the american and european yoke of unjustified and unwarranted illegal sanctions? those evil sanctions violate the fundamental principles of the charter of the united nations and should be condemned by the international community. we once again call for their immediate and unconditional removal. we are a peaceful and peace-loving nation, ready to engage in constructive dialogue for mutually beneficial relations. we call on those who continue to harbour ill will against us to cast away their hegemony-driven hostility, as we appeal to them to review their hard- line and cruel positions and open a new chapter in their relations with us based on mutual respect and friendly cooperation. to support the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda, we call for an expeditious reform of the bretton woods institutions, particularly their governance structures. it is high time that we addressed the democratic deficit in those institutions and improved their legitimacy. those reforms must reflect current realities and ensure the full voice and participation of developing countries in the decision-making and norm- setting activities. zimbabwe firmly believes that the united nations should promote dialogue to achieve peace, the rule of law and common understanding among states. the peace, security, stability and welfare of africa and our subregion is vital for us. in africa, the african union is working tirelessly to push for peace in the democratic republic of the congo, south sudan, the central african republic and somalia. the international community must remain intensively engaged and support africa in the maintenance of peace and stability, thereby enhancing its peacekeeping-capacity needs through training and logistical and financial support. africa also remains seized of the issue of western sahara, the last colonial vestige in africa. the united nations should not shake off its responsibility to ensure the realization of self-determination by the people of western sahara. we continue to witness the suffering and persecution of the people of palestine at the hands of israel. we have witnessed the callous murder of women and children in shelters, where they seek refuge from israels bombs. we have witnessed the brutal and random destruction of infrastructure in the gaza strip. while those heinous acts were being perpetrated by israel, the so-called civilized world maintained a deafening silence. and we ask, why? lasting peace in the middle east can be achieved only through a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders. any other manoeuvres to change demographic realities through settlements or the use of force will only prolong the suffering of the palestinians. in conclusion, as we move forward, it is important to muster the necessary political will to create a development-oriented international environment that facilitates the eradication of poverty and enhances the sound management of our natural resources for economic and social development, under a renewed and real global partnership.",Zimbabwe,Africa,88.6934204101562,6.138350009918213,1061.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,3.770028275212064
MUS,70,2015,"twelve years ago, i bade farewell to the assembly, as i had decided to retire from active politics thereafter, which i did. however, destiny and the wish of the people of mauritius brought me back into the political arena, and i stand here anew as prime minister of the republic of mauritius, following my electoral victory in december 2014 through free and fair elections. this is yet another affirmation of the fact that mauritius upholds a high tradition of democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law and peaceful coexistence. we will solemnly continue to uphold those universal values, which require our careful nurturing as states members of the united nations. for indeed, there can be no better tribute to the united nations, as we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the charter, than to see nations working together to sustain those values and to promote the establishment of peace and security. in that context, we commend the secretary-general for the timely setting up of the high-level independent panel on peace operations to review the united nations peace architecture. we are particularly supportive of the recommendation for stronger and deeper partnerships among global and regional organizations aimed at promoting international peace and security. for we in mauritius have witnessed how the collective efforts of the united nations, the african union, the southern african development community, the indian ocean commission and other regional economic communities unlocked the political stalemate in madagascar, enabling our neighbour and brother nation to pursue its path to development. similar collaboration has also enabled the african union to deploy robust operations in complex situations in mali, the central african republic and somalia. mauritius strongly condemns the recent coup in burkina faso and appreciates the current initiatives of the united nations, the african union and economic community of west african states to keep that country on the path of democracy. mauritius is fully committed to the implementation of agenda 2063 of the african union, which represents the collective vision of africans for a peaceful, united and prosperous africa. we congratulate the palestinian authority on the occasion of the formal recognition by the united 15-29816 13/45 a/70/pv.25 02/10/2015 nations of palestine as an observer. mauritius calls on the international community to put in even greater efforts to ensure that the two independent, secure and viable states of palestine and israel live peacefully side by side. similarly, we wish to see an end to the phenomenon of refugees fleeing one tragedy only to face an even greater disaster. the spread of armaments, nuclear proliferation, terrorism and piracy remain important threats to world peace and require our constant vigilance. my country will therefore pursue its fight against piracy as a member of the contact group on somali piracy and welcomes the decision to review the boundaries of the high risk area, so as to reduce inflationary pressures on maritime and freight costs. we welcome the agreement reached on the iranian nuclear issue and call for the implementation of the joint comprehensive plan of action, as it can contribute to international peace and security. let me share with the assembly the fact that mauritius acceded to the arms trade treaty in july, and yesterday i deposited our instrument of accession to the convention on cluster munitions. as we deal with the issue of armaments, we must remain conscious of the fact that the biggest weapon of all remains fear the fear that terrorists use so extensively to curtail freedom of thought, freedom of expression and impose their intolerance upon those who dare to be different. mauritius unreservedly condemns terrorism, in all its forms and remains committed to combating intolerance and extremism, whether at the domestic level or internationally. as we focus on peace and security, let us continue to let ourselves be inspired by the life and deeds of mahatma gandhi, whose birth date we are commemorating today. we have another golden opportunity here to pay tribute to the mahatma, the apostle of nonviolence, the man who shunned intolerance and who asked us to live simply so that others may simply live. as a small island developing state (sids) that is vulnerable to natural hazards, mauritius believes that the greatest challenge to peace and security in the years to come will be climate change, which requires our utmost attention now. if we do not act collectively and in a spirit of solidarity, if we are unable to reach a binding climate agreement at the coming united nations climate change conference that would limit the world temperature increase to less than 1.5c compared to 1990, we will be failing in our duty towards mother earth and future generations. let there be a space carved out for small island developing states, the most vulnerable of all, for the least developed countries (ldcs) and for africa to enable them to implement fully the necessary mitigation and adaptation measures. let financing be available and predictable, in addition to the sharing of technology to address a collective threat. in this respect, mauritius is pleased to host the commonwealth climate finance skills hub, which will be launched at the forthcoming commonwealth heads of government meeting in malta. this mechanism aims to assist sids and ldcs access much-needed funds for adaptation and mitigation. mauritius particularly welcomes sustainable development goal 5, relating to womens and girls empowerment. mauritius has made steady progress on this agenda and continues to put in place appropriate strategies to further promote gender equality in all spheres of development. i am proud to announce that for the first time in history, my country has three women in high positions: president of the republic, vice-president, and speaker of the national assembly of mauritius. there can be no democracy without human rights and no human rights without development. a balance needs to be maintained in the trident of peace, human rights and development. we are living at a time of uncertainty when not a single nation is immune from external shocks, but some are more exposed than others. as a small developing state, my country is highly vulnerable to external shocks and a high current account deficit. we depend on foreign markets for tourism, trade and investments, and we have limited fiscal space to manoeuvre. in addition, our ageing population not only leads to a reduction of our productive capacity, but also costs significant resources in terms of health care financing and retirement benefits. however, against this bleak backdrop, my government is making sure that the welfare state, of which we are so proud, is maintained. we are re-engineering our economy. we have pledged to achieve an average gross domestic product (gdp) growth of 5.5 per cent annually as from 2017 on the back of a technology- and innovation-driven economy focusing on sustainability and human development. 14/45 15-29816 02/10/2015 a/70/pv.25 more than ever, mauritius needs the support of the international community to untangle itself from the middle-income web and reach the high-income country status. financial institutions and development partners need to look beyond our relatively high gdp, which obscures the real cost that we have to pay for our development and precludes us from accessing vital development finance and support. development partners should not forget that the specific and unique vulnerabilities of sids have been reiterated, highlighted and acknowledged by world leaders in the sids accelerated modalities of action (samoa) pathway and now in the post-2015 agenda. it is gratifying to note that the addis ababa international conference on financing for development has pledged to support the economic transformation of sids and ldcs through domestic resource mobilization, catalytic use of official development assistance and strong trade commitments. these promises should be effectively translated into reality to drive forward our sustainable development agenda. mauritius is committed to upholding good governance, transparency and the rule of law at all levels. we have been very active in ensuring effective implementation of international standards of transparency and exchange of information, with a view to combating tax evasion, money laundering and other malpractices. mauritius was one of the earliest states to sign a multilateral competent authority agreement with the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd), to automatically exchange information on financial matters, and in june we reaffirmed our commitment by officially signing the oecds multilateral convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters. in march this year, mauritius was privileged to host the signature ceremony for the united nations convention on transparency in treaty-based investor- state arbitration (resolution 69/116, annex), otherwise known as the mauritius convention on transparency. by being the first country to sign and ratify the convention, we are forcefully demonstrating our commitment to democratic participation, transparency and good governance. the rule of law should be promoted not only at the national, but also at the international, level. we need to pursue meaningful efforts to reform the united nations to make it more responsive to the needs and aspirations of all the member states. if our organization is to remain legitimate, there should be a comprehensive reform of the security council. the status quo is not an option. the legitimate aspiration of africa for permanent representation in the council should not be denied. mauritius reaffirms its commitment to the african common position, enshrined in the ezulwini consensus and the sirte declaration. small island developing states, which represent over a quarter of united nations membership, deserve representation on the council. likewise, mauritius supports indias rightful aspiration to a permanent seat in a reformed security council. mauritius has always firmly supported the resolution of disputes by peaceful means, as inscribed in the charter of the united nations. we believe that, in accordance with resolutions of the assembly, it is high time to complete the process of decolonization in africa. it is also high time to resolve the situation that prevents mauritius from effectively exercising its sovereignty over the chagos archipelago and the island of tromelin, which form an integral part of the territory of mauritius. the chagos archipelago was illegally excised by the united kingdom from the territory of mauritius prior to its accession to independence, in breach of international law and resolutions of the assembly. in the wake of that illegal excision, the mauritians who were residing at the time in the chagos archipelago were forcibly evicted by the british authorities, in total disregard of their human rights. most of them were moved to the main island of mauritius. the government of mauritius is fully sensitive to their plight and to their legitimate aspiration, as mauritian citizens, to resettle in the archipelago. mauritius welcomes the award of the arbitral tribunal delivered on 18 march against the united kingdom, under the united nations convention on the law of the sea. we welcome the tribunals decision that the marine protected area purportedly declared by the united kingdom around the chagos archipelago was established in violation of international law. we also welcome the tribunals unanimous recognition that mauritius has an interest in significant decisions bearing upon the uses of the archipelago pending its return to the effective control of mauritius. this arbitral proceeding was the first occasion on which any international judge or arbitrator has considered the facts and history lying behind mauritius entitlement to sovereignty over the chagos archipelago. 15-29816 15/45 a/70/pv.25 02/10/2015 mauritius appreciates the fact that two arbitrators have confirmed the opinion that the united kingdom is not the coastal state in relation to the chagos archipelago. that view has not been contradicted by any other judge or arbitrator. it unquestionably confirms our stand that the chagos archipelago is and always has been an integral part of the territory of mauritius. the tribunal underscores the united kingdoms legally binding obligations to mauritius. it establishes beyond doubt that under international law mauritius has real, firm and binding rights over the chagos archipelago and that the united kingdom must respect those rights. the tribunal recognized that mauritius has a legal interest in the chagos archipelago such that decisions affecting its future use cannot be taken without the involvement of mauritius. despite the tribunals clear ruling, we regret that the united kingdom appears to be adopting a different approach to mauritiuss rights. it recently launched a so-called consultation exercise on the potential resettlement of mauritians of chagossian origin in the chagos archipelago under conditions that again amount to a gross violation of their most basic human rights. mauritius rejects this purported consultation exercise unreservedly. we wish to assure the international community that once mauritius is able to effectively exercise its sovereignty over the chagos archipelago, our brothers and sisters of chagossian origin who resettle there will be able to live in dignity and enjoy their basic human rights, as they currently do in mauritius. considering the tribunals decision, we urge the united states of america, which is currently using diego garcia for defence purposes, to engage in discussions with mauritius regarding the long-term interests of mauritius where the chagos archipelago is concerned, particularly in view of the affirmation by the president of the united states when he said so earnestly in his address to the assembly on monday that we cannot stand by when the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a nation is flagrantly violated (a/70/pv.13, p. 12). the government of mauritius is resolutely committed to making every effort that accords with international law to enable it to effectively exercise its sovereignty over the chagos archipelago, including the possibility of having further recourse to judicial or arbitral bodies. we urge the assembly and the international community in general to support mauritius in its legitimate endeavours. the assembly has a direct institutional interest in the resolution of the matter. the assembly has of course historically played a central role in addressing decolonization through the exercise of its powers and functions, especially in relation to chapters xi through xiii of the charter of the united nations. in its resolution 1514 (xv), of 14 december 1960, on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples, the assembly declared that any attempt to disrupt the territorial integrity of such a country was incompatible with the purposes and principles of the charter. in resolution 2066 (xx), of 16 december 1965, which dealt specifically with mauritius, the assembly drew attention to the duty of the administering power not to dismember the territory or violate the territorial integrity of the then colony. the assembly therefore has a responsibility to help to complete the historic process of decolonization that it so successfully instigated and oversaw in the second half of the twentieth century. that is why we are convinced that the assembly should now establish a mechanism to enable and monitor the full implementation of its relevant resolutions. i would like to take this opportunity to express mauritiuss deep appreciation for the unflinching support it has consistently received from members of the african union, the non-aligned movement, the group of 77 and china, and other friendly countries on the issue of its sovereignty over the chagos archipelago. as regards tromelin, we urge france to pursue a dialogue with mauritius in order to quickly resolve the dispute over that island in the spirit of friendship that has always characterized the relationship between our two countries. (spoke in french) we know we can count on frances nobility and its ideals of justice and fraternity to ensure that mauritius can exercise effective sovereignty over tromelin. i will conclude by saying that for peace, security and inclusive and sustainable development to prevail in our countries, we must act from our hearts. only then will we succeed in building the world we all dream of. we should take inspiration from the wisdom- packed message of pope francis, who blessed us with 16/45 15-29816 02/10/2015 a/70/pv.25 his presence in the assembly last week. as he said so magnanimously: it must never be forgotten that political and economic activity is only effective when it is understood as a prudential activity, guided by a perennial concept of justice and constantly conscious of the fact that, above and beyond our plans and programmes, we are dealing with real men and women, just like the government leaders, who live, struggle and suffer, and are often forced to live in great poverty, deprived of all rights.

MLI,70,2015,"on behalf of the malian delegation, i would first like to warmly congratulate the president on his accession to the presidency of the general assembly at its seventieth session. there can be no doubt that his election on 15 june not only recognized his qualities as an experienced diplomat but was also a tribute to his country, the kingdom of denmark, which has an excellent relationship with my country that is cooperative in every way. i would like to assure him that my delegation is completely at his disposal in his efforts to achieve full success for his mandate. i would also like to express our great appreciation to his predecessor, our brother mr. sam kutesa of uganda, for his outstanding and effective conduct of the work of the preceding session. in the same spirit, i would like to pay tribute to mr. ban ki-moon, the eighth secretary-general, for his dedication and unwavering commitment to peace and security. before going any further, i, like others before me, would like to salute the memory of the victims of the disaster in mina, saudi arabia, from mali and other countries in the islamic community. in these tragic circumstances, on behalf of the people of mali, i would like to express my deepest condolences to the families of the victims and wish the injured a speedy recovery. we sometimes see coincidences in the history of peoples and institutions. one such is the symbolism of todays date, 28 september 2015, which marks the fifty-fifth anniversary of the admission of my country, mali, into the united nations, pursuant to resolution 1491 (xv), adopted by the assembly at its fifteenth session, and for that i would like to express my profound gratitude to the republic of tunisia and to sri lanka, known then as ceylon, under the leadership of mrs. sirimavo bandaranaike. between 28 september 1960 and today, successive governments of mali have spared no effort to fashion a better world, free of the spectres of conflict and war, whose main victims are women, children and the elderly. coming as i do from mali, i know of what i speak. in its continuing quest for peace, the government of mali, under my authority, has always preferred the path of dialogue to the language of arms in the multidimensional crisis that we are in the process of resolving. in that regard, the government of mali has always complied with the relevant resolutions of the security council and the decisions and recommendations of the economic community of west african states (ecowas), the african union, the organization of islamic cooperation (oic) and the non-aligned movement. it was as part of that dynamic that i took the initiative to engage my government in the inter-malian negotiations in algiers, supported by international mediation that included representatives of the united nations, under the auspices of algeria. i am happy to be able to commend here the personal commitment of algerias president, our big brother mr. abdelaziz bouteflika. after eight months of discussion with our brothers in the north who had taken up arms, i am particularly pleased to present the agreement for peace and reconciliation in mali. arriving at the agreement through the algiers process has been difficult, but it is done. while not a panacea and not without problems, the agreement gives us a general framework within which we can work towards a lasting and sustainable peace. this consensus peace agreement, which can serve as a general framework for every malian party in every aspect of life, is the first in malis history. it represents a new social pact for mali and malians, and a new collective commitment to peace and concord in our country. the agreement has just sealed forever the reunion of the children of mali. it is the result of the will of all the malian parties and the commitment of all involved to reaching the stage we are now in, that of implementing the agreement. for us it is a balanced compromise that takes into consideration all our essential and legitimate concerns, including the issues of malis territorial integrity, national sovereignty and balanced development of every region of the country. that is what is most important to us and is what the agreement grants and guarantees us. i would also like to express to all those here today my countrys commitment and to give our thanks for everyones assistance. few countries in recent years have been on the receiving end of such assistance as has mali in this stage of its national reconstruction. that is why we will not drag our feet. we have our agreement, and we have now created its implementation framework, the comite de suivi de laccord, put together immediately after the signing of the agreement, which has already got down to work. we have taken measures 15-29425 19/34 a/70/pv.15 28/09/2015 to build confidence among all our citizens and to assure them of our unflagging commitment to implementing peace and build a new mali. without peace, we cannot succeed. we were elected by the people of mali, despite the grave crisis we have endured, specifically to rebuild our country. i would also like to say that the people of mali hope to be supported in this implementation phase of the agreement for peace. implementing a peace agreement is a delicate business, and it needs support. that is why we have scheduled a conference in paris on 22 october to raise funds for the development of mali. god willing, we will hold the conference and, hopefully, many of our friends here today who have helped us so much will come. for its part, the government of mali has developed and submitted to the comite de suivi a comprehensive action plan for implementing the agreement and an emergency plan for the interim period. i should stress that the comite de suivi has warmly welcomed that approach. however, it is worth pointing out that signing the agreement is not an end in itself but requires that we pool all of our efforts to implement it, and that is a major challenge that we can rise to, god willing. that is why i repeat my call to come to the conference in paris on 22 october. the government of mali reiterates its call to all signatory parties to the agreement as well as the international community to pool their efforts and information to expel from the sahel and malis national territory our common enemy, namely, terrorist groups and narco-jihadists who seek only to satisfy their criminal appetites by means of fear and terror. i welcome the adoption of security council resolution 2227 (2015), which renewed for the third time the mandate of the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali, whose remarkable work accomplished to date i salute. i assure the mission of my support and assistance for the success of our shared mission. on the same note, i want to express the gratitude of the government of mali for the international mediation led by algeria, which included the united nations, the african union, ecowas, the european union, the oic, burkina faso, mauritania, the niger, nigeria and chad. i do not think i have left anyone out. i also welcome the role and the decisive contribution of france in mali and all the sacrifices made in this regard. i also welcome the equally important role of the united states of america in the peace process. to all the friendly nations and the international partner organizations that have expressed solidarity vis-a-vis mali by sending us their children or their experts to defend the values that form the basis of our humanity, i renew here the sincere thanks of the malian people. i bow reverently very piously to the memory of all victims, civilian and military, malian or foreign, fallen on the field of honour in mali for the defence of human dignity, freedom and democracy. i salute and thank unesco, under the leadership of our friend irina bokova, for the remarkable work accomplished to preserve the cultural heritage in our closed, revered city of timbuktu. the fate suffered by the mausoleums, which modern-day barbarians consigned to collective memory, is well known. what we saw happen in palmyra had occurred earlier in mali, together with the terror that the international criminal court (icc) has begun to address. we welcome the recent decision by the icc on this new crime. when representatives of 50 nations signed the charter of the united nations in san francisco on 26 june 1945 and when charter entered into force on 24 october 1945, many states here today had not yet attained independence. we are pleased that, 70 years later, the united nations now has 193 members, all committed to preserving the ideals of san francisco, based on the three pillars of peace and security, development and human rights. that is why the delegation of the republic of mali, which i have the honour to lead, is pleased with the general assemblys extremely appropriate decision to make the theme of the general debate the united nations at 70 a new commitment to action. this theme, the choice of which is of proven relevance, will undoubtedly permit all world leaders and lovers of peace, freedom and justice to make an objective assessment of the progress the organization has made and to consider the future with a critical eye trained on the difficulties encountered in the past, particularly in areas where the united nations and the international community are called upon to make greater efforts to meet current and future challenges. at this time of reckoning, we welcome the important progress made in implementing the provisions of chapter vi of the charter on the pacific settlement of disputes through negotiation, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, all of 20/34 15-29425 28/09/2015 a/70/pv.15 which have resulted in the prevention, management, maintenance and consolidation of peace in the world. we also welcome the significant progress achieved in the processes of decolonization, disarmament and the promotion of human rights. indeed, we appreciate the true value of building agreements under chapter viii of the charter, in particular between the security council and the african union peace and security council. while these successes show the ongoing relevance of certain principles set forth in the charter of the united nations, we must recognize that their implementation has been made possible thanks to the political will of member states and the effectiveness of the staff of the united nations system, including peacekeepers, who work tirelessly, under chapter vii to bring about a better world. i wish to express to all of them the deep gratitude of the government and the people of mali. in a constantly changing world, the united nations is required to adapt to new challenges. part of the latest dynamic will be the implementation of post-2015 development agenda, entitled transforming our world: the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which we recently adopted (resolution 70/1). a perfect example of a country of the sahel, my country, mali, has suffered the brunt of the effects of climate change because of the fragility of its natural ecosystem. the accretion of sand, the drying up of the niger river, and the degradation of the soil and vegetation cover with unsuspected consequences are prime illustrations of what we have had to confront. therefore, the government and the people of mali strongly hope that the conclusions of twenty-first session of the conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, to be held in paris in december, will lead to the conclusion of a legally binding agreement for the preservation of what remains of our environment. in addition to this major challenge, there is the need to promote global economic governance and the financing of development. the results of the third international conference on financing for development, held in addis ababa in july 2015, offer hope in terms of mobilizing the international community to achieve the sustainable development goals, consistent with the monterrey consensus of 2002 and the doha declaration of 2008. as a landlocked developing country and among the least developed countries, mali welcomes debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries and commends the countries that have achieved or even exceeded the target threshold of setting aside 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product for public aid. that is indeed to be welcomed. in this regard, i reaffirm from this rostrum the recognition of my government of all the generous donors who, in may 2013 in brussels, were willing to commit to the economic recovery of mali, through pledges totalling 3.5 billion. i would also like to take this opportunity to call on countries that have not yet done so to keep their commitments with a view to the effective mobilization of the pledged sums, because sometimes the distance between the cup and the lip is great. with respect to the sources of innovative financing, the government of mali supports and strongly encourages the unitlife initiative based on the simple principle of assigning a tiny part of the immense wealth created by the use and exploitation of extractive resources in africa to the fight against malnutrition, so that the globalization of solidarity responds to the globalization of the economy. through this initiative, the government of mali plans to collect a percentage of the revenues from mining, especially gold, for the purposes of investing the funds in the fight against malnutrition in our county, because that will free up opportunities for tomorrow. malnutrition affects our most vulnerable groups, including the one that will bear the future our young people with all the evils that it can cause, in particular cretinism, which no one should wish to have, just when we need to have qualified, fit-for-purpose human resources. one of the greatest challenges in the world today concerns international migration, a phenomenon whose alarming growth can be attributed to poverty, natural disasters, man-made catastrophe and, i am sorry to say, the cynicism of organized criminals, because criminality certainly exists. the evidence lies in the tens of thousands who are willing to lose their lives through illegal migration in the sands of the desert and the depths of the ocean, as we are seeing today in the mediterranean. the comprehensive approach that the delegation of mali proposes depends on intensifying the dialogue among countries of origin, transit and destination in order to find appropriate solutions capable of connecting the requirements of security, development, respect for human dignity and solidarity, which are in fact a single package. if we achieve this, migration will take place in 15-29425 21/34 a/70/pv.15 28/09/2015 a humane and orderly fashion, benefiting migrants and the countries of origin and destination. with respect to security, the united nations now needs to strengthen its tools and mechanisms with a view to creating a genuine response to the new threats of violent terrorism, drug-trafficking and related crimes. despite the inroads we have made in the area of peace and security, it is regrettable that the international arena continues to to be characterized by the increasing violence perpetrated or masterminded by terrorist groups and narco-jihadists such as ansar dine, the mouvement pour lunicite et le jihad en afrique de louest, al-mourabitoun, the islamic state of iraq and the levant, al-qaida, al-shabaab, and boko haram, which is now known as the islamic state in western africa. it is clearly urgent to bridge the gap between security challenges and the united nations peacekeeping doctrine. we should not forget that this doctrine was designed 60 years ago. i wish from this rostrum to reaffirm malis active support for any initiative to reform the peacekeeping architecture by incorporating that new reality, because no country today can ignore the fact that terrorism has become a threat to international peace and security. mali supports all initiatives for peace in the middle east, especially any initiative that would enable the people of the region, especially the people of palestine, to finally enjoy lasting and just peace through the two- state solution, which was adopted long ago and should finally be realized. the government of mali also welcomes the restoration of normal diplomatic between cuba and the united states of america. i commend the efforts, courage and political realism of president barack obama and president raul castro ruz, as well as of pope francis. pope francis is a man of peace and a man of heart, as he showed last friday when he addressed the nations of the world from this very rostrum (see a/70/pv.3). he played a very important role in the normalization of relations between cuba and the united states, and i commend him for that. clearly, our organization has its work cut out for it. if it did not exist, it would surely have to be created. reform of the security council is another major topic of discussion. security council reform will certainly be one of the most cross-cutting goals of our seventieth session. mali supports the african common position, as articulated in the ezulwini consensus and the sirte declaration. we will continue to consult with other regional groups in order to forge the requisite political will to correct the historical injustice to which the continent of africa continues to be subjected by virtue of its lack of representation as a permanent member and its underrepresentation as a non-permanent member of the security council. that is not normal and not right in the case of such an important continent a continent of the future, as the whole world is well aware. united nations reform should also include global economic governance in order to make the international financial institutions better able to assist the nations of the south to address the challenges of underdevelopment. in that regard, i urgently call on member states, regional groups and the international community to tirelessly pursue the constructive dialogue that has been under way since 2009 so that united nations reform can finally be achieved. indeed, the amendments to articles 23, 27, 61 and 109 of the charter of the united nations, which entered into force between 1965 and 1968, are sufficient proof that reform of the united nations is far from being a pandoras box to be feared. we must therefore embark on reform with boldness and good will. indeed, reform will allow the decision-making bodies of the organization to reflect its geographical balance and to improve working conditions, including the relationship between the security council and the general assembly. a reformed united nations would gain credibility in the eyes of international public opinion and its decisions would have a greater chance of being accepted and implemented. to conclude, i reiterate the full commitment of the people of mali to the ideals of the charter of the united nations, especially the preservation of future generations from the scourge of war.",Mali,Africa,33.0688896179199,3.801520109176636,3135.0,11.0,0.0,11.0,3.5087719298245617
TCD,70,2015,"fifteen years ago, we welcomed unanimously the adoption of the millennium declaration (resolution 55/2) and the millennium development goals as the appropriate response to the poverty-related problems facing many of our countries. with the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda (resolution 70/1), the general assembly, at its seventieth session, has once again reaffirmed states determination to fight poverty by seeking new ways and means of promoting development. the success of the implementation of the agenda will require suitable joint responses to the numerous challenges facing the world. for many african countries, success in this endeavour will hinge on their security situation and their ability to finance their development plans and strategies. on a daily basis they face challenges that include terrorism and a drop in export prices. the successful implementation of this new development agenda will also depend on the solidarity of developed countries towards developing countries in terms of effective financing. that is why we have high expectations that the conclusions of the third international conference on financing for development, held in addis ababa, will be translated into reality. the theme of this session, the united nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights, means that we should place at the very heart of our general debate the issue of resolving the challenges that our organization currently faces, the most intractable of which include armed conflicts, terrorism and migration. there is no doubt that africa is one of the epicentres in that respect, given the multiple tragedies taking place there. in the central african republic, for example, the particularly bloody clashes of recent days are jeopardizing the few hard-won victories achieved during the transition. the international community must not throw in the towel and must help the country emerge from this phase by providing it with the necessary budgetary support to hold elections within the set time frame. in the lake chad basin, the terrorist activities being carried out virtually on a daily basis by the terrorist group boko haram against the countries of the subregion have not ceased despite considerable losses it suffered during the military operations carried out by a coalition of those countries armies. a multinational joint task force has been set up by the countries members of the lake chad basin commission in order to put an end to the abuses committed by that nefarious group. 15-29658 53/55 a/70/pv.22 01/10/2015 we remain confident that, with the intensification of this military cooperation, we will be able to once and for all eradicate this evil terrorist group. we also expect the united nations and all of our partners to provide material, financial and logistical support to that force. aside from military action, these countries have decided to adopt an emergency development programme to help the most vulnerable populations fight against the deep-seated causes of insecurity, which are linked to poverty. this initiative, which originated in the lake chad basin commission, is a game-changer in terms of the peace and security efforts in the region and merits our support. in mali, the peace agreements signed recently in algiers, which are aimed at transforming that country back into the haven of peace and tolerance that it had always been, are being put seriously to the test by armed groups, despite the presence of international forces. chad calls on all parties to show wisdom and to respect their commitments in implementing the aforementioned agreements. in libya, the presence of a number of elements linked to the islamic state in iraq and the levant continues to contribute to the collapse of that country and is an additional source of concern and even destabilization for africa as a whole and in particular for neighbouring countries, including chad. we urgently call for an end to the violence and for the establishment of a government of national unity. in south sudan, chad is working actively alongside a number of african countries to end the fratricidal war taking place there. political actors must make every effort to concentrate solely on building their young state. the intergovernmental authority on development and the ad hoc committee tasked with supporting it in mediation must continue to stand firm and act cohesively so as to achieve a lasting solution to this terrifying crisis. in the sudan, we support the holding of the national dialogue planned for next month, and we call upon the political class as a whole and all armed groups to take part in the process. the majority of african crises are born of or fuelled by underdevelopment. that is why several initiatives have been launched, including the 2013 united nations integrated strategy for the sahel, that have given rise to great hopes for the countries of the region, confronted as they are with the dual challenge of insecurity and underdevelopment. it is regrettable, however, that the announcements made in the context of the strategy are taking a long time to be translated into reality. turning to the rest of the world, the israeli- palestinian conflict remains unresolved, prolonging the suffering of the palestinian people and intensifying rancour on all sides. it is high time to overcome the psychological obstacles by promoting the creation of a viable palestinian state living in peace side by side with israel. the raising yesterday of the palestinian flag within the united nations compound is, we hope, an important step towards finding a peaceful solution to this conflict, which is as old as our organization. in addition to this endless conflict, we are witnessing particularly violent crises in iraq, syria and yemen. the international community must make every effort to help these countries overcome these tragedies, whose repercussions are being felt not only in the middle east but also in the rest of the world. international peace and security are under serious threat from what is now happening in that part of the world. religious radicalism and terrorism have found extremely fertile ground for their expansion. the crisis situations that we have just described have greatly contributed to the upsurge in terrorism and the formation of criminal groups of all stripes. terrorism, which spares no continent and no community, is fast becoming a global scourge. the acts of extreme violence committed against peaceful populations under religious or doctrinaire pretexts run counter to the principles of international law and human rights as well as religious principles. in africa, states grappling with terrorism are being forced to spend the lions share of their resources on security instead of on economic and social development. my country, chad, is in this situation. we recently fell prey to that scourge with the death of around 100 persons assassinated in terrorist attacks in the capital and on the islands of lake chad. chad is therefore paying for its involvement against terrorist groups in mali and nigeria, on whom it inflicted heavy losses, but chad not will yield. it will continue to hunt down those terrorist groups relentlessly. all we ask from our partners is that they give us robust support, both technical and material, to enable us to provide the response needed in this faceless war. the capacity of terrorists and extremist groups for transborder harm requires a collective and nimble 54/55 15-29658 01/10/2015 a/70/pv.22 response. the way to fight terrorism together is to pool our resources and our response strategies through intensifying regional and international cooperation. in that connection, we propose that 2016 be declared the year of fighting terrorism. it would be an opportunity to think seriously about the deep-seated causes of that phenomenon, the ways and means to contain it and to eliminate it in the long term. the increase in the number and seriousness of crises has also created a phenomenon whose scale is unprecedented in the world: migration. indeed, for some months now, the world has been witnessing an unexpected expansion of international migration. those consequences are tragic for hundreds of thousands of women and children desperately seeking a better life. the international community will be able to put an end to this migration only if appropriate solutions are found to its origins and underlying causes, particularly in resolving conflicts and eradicating poverty in the countries of origin. we also need to find solutions for the thousands of refugees and persons displaced throughout the world. they also need our help. chad is the african country with the second-largest number of refugees, returnees and displaced persons on its territory, estimated at over 500,000. they come from the regions bordering chad, particularly sudanese darfur, the central african republic, nigeria and libya. they live in difficult environmental and humanitarian conditions. once again, i would like to take this opportunity to thank all friendly countries and especially the secretariats office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs and the international organization for migration for their support to those in need and for the advocacy they do for our country. our world has been facing an insidious threat for some time now climate change. that will be dealt with at a major conference in paris next month. chad will actively be present at that conference because it is one of the major victims of degradation due to climate change. we are a sahelian country threatened by drought and desertification, and we are powerless in the face of the progressive drying up of lake chad. we strongly hope that the negotiations will lead to an agreement and give us some hope that we can save our planet, including the imperilled lake chad. the celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the united nations also coincides with a very happy event, namely, the normalization of relations between the united states of america and cuba, which chad welcomes. we commend the courage shown by the leaders of those two countries to achieve that outcome. we urge them to continue their constructive dialogue until we see a complete and definitive lifting of the embargo that cuba has unjustly suffered for decades, which will enable that country to recover the place it merits in the concert of nations. before concluding my remarks, the delegation of chad would like to congratulate the president on his election and thank his predecessor for his remarkable work. we also pay tribute to the secretary-general of our organization for his personal and steady investment in the search for peace and security in the world. i hope that this general debate will be crowned with success and, above all, that we will become much more aware of our individual and collective responsibilities. we also hope that it guides humanity to peace, security, stability and prosperity.",Chad,Africa,26.0029907226562,2.342831495211616,1758.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,2.844141069397042
TGO,70,2015,"before i begin, sir, allow me to express my warmest congratulations to my friend john dramani mahama, president of the republic of ghana, for his excellent statement. i am pleased to address the assembly as we embark upon a new phase in our long search for peace, security, development and shared prosperity. at the outset, allow me to express my warm congratulations to mr. mogens lykketoft on his election to the presidency of the general assembly at its seventieth session. i would also like to reiterate our full appreciation for the positive efforts that secretary-general ban ki-moon has undertaken since assuming his post. ever since its founding, our organization has fully engaged with states, regional organizations and citizens to promote peace and security and to progressively raise standards of living. i therefore salute the long path we have travelled together. since becoming a member of the organization, on 20 september 1960, my country has made the values and priorities at the heart of the united nations its own. togo has striven with great determination to contribute to the triumph of the noble ideals of our organization. in return, togo has also received a great deal from the family of the united nations. the most recent example of that fruitful cooperation goes back to the presidential election of 25 april. we will not forget that, throughout the electoral process, togo benefited from the multidimensional support and attentive interest of its friends and partners, in particular the united nations development programme and the united nations 15-29562 21/54 a/70/pv.19 30/09/2015 office for west africa. that solidarity was a source of encouragement to us and provided added impetus for us to make the extra effort that the togolese people expected of us in order to succeed in the holding of the election. i would like to take this opportunity to express the deep gratitude of the togolese people for that support. today, the togolese people intend to build fully on that success, thanks in particular to our political reforms, which seek to further strengthen democracy and our ability to work together in the pursuit of progress. in that regard, fully aware of the stakes involved in ensuring peace and security in a just and fair society, togo plans to make economic and social inclusion the priority in its strategy of national unity. the priority of priorities for togo is to advance in consolidating the well-being of all its citizens, and thereby be able to play a more active role in the realization of our new post- 2015 development agenda. our national priorities for the coming years essentially dovetail with our new commitments under the framework of the sustainable development goals (sdgs). the new 2030 agenda for sustainable development with its sdgs (resolution 70/1) requires us to do a much better job than we were able to do in the past with the millennium development goals. even if we did not succeed in achieving all of those goals within the agreed timetable, today we at least have the benefit of the experience, mistakes and successes of the past, which represent a huge capital on which to draw in order to better address the challenges before us. at a time when we are deliberating the future of international cooperation, i think that it is crucial for us not to forget the high price that we have just paid in tackling the ebola virus. since i was supervising the fight against that disease in the economic community of west african states the epicentre of the outbreaks of that virus i would like to take this opportunity to express our profound gratitude to the states, regional organizations, bilateral and multilateral partners and non-governmental organizations that mobilized significant resources and assisted the countries most affected in various ways to stem the epidemic. i would also like to salute the heroism of the health-care personnel of various nationalities and communities who never abdicated their responsibilities, even when their lives were in danger. they saved lives and demonstrated our capacity to respond to extreme situations. finally, i would to express my sincere condolences for all of those who gave their lives in attempting to save the lives of others. ebola has claimed lives, destroyed communities and weakened economies. it is responsible for losses of approximately $2 billion in gross domestic product in the three countries affected. today, ebola has been weakened but has not been completely conquered. we must all remain vigilant, not only to eradicate the residual hotbeds of that disease but also to rebuild systems that are more resilient to the vulnerabilities and shocks to which we remain exposed. such crises must not, however, prevent us from staying the course or from keeping our promises to achieve economic growth and social progress. i urge all of our partners to remain active and committed, including those in countries that have so far been spared. while we can be pleased with the fact that economic growth in africa has been among the highest in the world in recent years, we must nevertheless note that, at the current pace, africa will not be able to provide a massive number of jobs for its young people, nor to significantly reduce poverty. the need for accelerated, inclusive economic growth requires structured actions and financing that go far beyond our traditional, financial architecture. for that reason, togo hopes that, following the addis ababa conference on financing for development, the community of donors will spare no effort to assist african countries, more constructively and with fewer restrictions, in their quest to diversify sources of financing and to expand their domestic budgetary space. in the same vein, at a time when we are seeking more appropriate mechanisms for financing development in africa, it would be regrettable if cultural values that form the bedrock of african societies were sacrificed. that could jeopardize the results that have already been achieved. in that regard, pressure should no longer be brought to bear on our states to force them to adopt programmes and initiatives that would lead to cultural shocks. as the bishops of africa said in their common declaration in june, we are concerned by the fact that aspects of the sustainable development goals that are linked to sexual and reproductive health could be made the conditionalities for the granting of resources, as the endorsement of such issues continues to be highly controversial in african societies. the long and rich experience of the united nations teaches us that peace and security are at the same time preconditions and elements of development. 22/54 15-29562 30/09/2015 a/70/pv.19 that dual requirement must be fully taken into account in the strategies that we will have to develop to effectively implement the sdgs. togo, whose economy is largely dependent upon the west african hinterland, knows the true value of security in the african subregion. combating the terrorist group boko haram and all forms of extremism and racism must continue relentlessly, with the help of the international community and in line with the values promoted by the united nations. the shifts in power in that regard that we have been seeing throughout africa in recent years do not correspond to any of the fundamental values of our continent. togo expects to capitalize on what has been achieved through the reform of its defence and security system in order to better tackle new challenges and threats. we can never stress enough how crucial it is to align our policies in the areas of security, the defence of human rights and environmental protection. the environmental dimension of crises and conflicts, the impact of climate change in exacerbating poverty and the repeated threats to human rights during times of war are realities that we cannot conceal if we want to preserve stability in our states over the long term. that is why the climate change conference to be held in paris in december will be the first test of whether or not the sustainable commitments we have just made are sound. given the importance of what is at stake, it falls to us to adopt a binding international agreement at that conference that will improve the lives of millions of people throughout the world by taking the necessary measures to keep climate change below the threshold of a 2c rise in temperature. in togo, unfortunately, we are already experiencing the effects of climate change every day, including coastal erosion, which amounts to a 10 to 12 metres annual advance of the sea, threatening our coastal populations. there are therefore immediate risks for the survival of those populations that require more urgent responses and significant investments. it is therefore crucial that future international financing aimed at combating the effects of climate change, and specifically financing that will make its way into the green fund, not come through a reduction in traditional official development assistance. i would like to take this opportunity to recall that the economic, security and environmental challenges connected with the seas and oceans will be addressed during the african union extraordinary summit on maritime security and safety and development in africa, which togo will have the privilege of hosting next year. at that summit, we hope to be able to adopt effective measures and make decisions that will enable us to work together so that the oceans and seas remain a major asset for the development of africa. after 70 years of peacekeeping operations, we must acknowledge that such operations are no longer sufficient to ensure the effectiveness of our actions when faced with the changing nature of crises and conflicts. it is for that reason that we must constantly innovate in order to adapt our responses to the current security challenges. in that regard, my country, which has always participated in peacekeeping missions, welcomes the report (a/70/95) of the high-level independent panel on united nations peace operations, which was established by the secretary-general to assess peacekeeping operations. its recommendations should receive our full attention. my country also welcomes the holding, two days ago, of the summit meeting on peacekeeping operations, organized by a group of states at the initiative of the united states of america. that meeting sought to make more resources available for peacekeeping operations. the magnitude of the challenges we are facing today requires that we constantly renew our commitment to the original purposes of the united nations. it is our duty to preserve, in times of war and in times of peace, human dignity and to build a world based on the promotion and protection of human rights. in that regard, i would like to pay well-deserved tribute to the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights, which recently closed its office in togo after having helped the government, national institutions and civil society strengthen their capacities in the area of the protection and promotion of human rights. the eight years of cooperation that have just come to an end enabled togo to make significant progress in the area of human rights. we intend to relentlessly pursue our efforts in that area, because we are firmly convinced that a society in which the rights of the individual are protected and guaranteed has all the cards it needs to achieve its promises of development and prosperity. it is my strong desire that the multifaceted cooperation that has mobilized us in the great united nations family can continue to

the united nations, our common organization, and renew my wishes for success in its future actions. above all, i express the hope that the years to come can give us an opportunity to preserve and strengthen our collective commitment to the ideals of peace, security and sustainable development.",Togo,Africa,63.7456207275391,3.71097993850708,1979.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,2.5265285497726127
CPV,70,2015,"i would ask the indulgence of the assembly that i may greet, on behalf of all cabo verdeans, all delegations to this seventieth session of the general assembly and add our voice to all statements made here that call for the building of a better world. this session provides us with the opportunity, as we celebrate the anniversary of the united nations with pride and joy, to engage in a critical and concrete reflection on the future of humankind and the challenges faced by the organization. the theme chosen for this session could not be more timely and pressing: the united nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights. seven decades after the signing of the san francisco charter, it is incumbent on us to examine the road travelled so far as we identify new actions that will allow our organization to grow in strength, unity and capacity in order to overcome challenges to international peace and security and make more concrete contributions to a bringing about a more just, equitable, sustainable and solidary world. cabo verde, which is celebrating the fortieth anniversary of its national independence this year, is among the countries that believe in the fundamental principles and goals of the united nations and defend its purposes and principles, which continue to be fundamental and current for the organizations actions and serve as vital tools with which to build a common future. we underline the crucial importance of reforming the united nations in preparation for the road ahead. we urge all member states to negotiate constructively with a view to agreeing on the revitalization of the powers of the general assembly and reaching an understanding on the enlargement of the security council, which in our view should reflect the changes that have occurred in the world, with a more equitable and appropriate representation. it was with great satisfaction that we participated in the sustainable development summit 2015, which began this past 25 september. we take this opportunity to again declare cabo verdes adherence to the principles contained in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development (resolution 70/1) and our full agreement with respect to the sustainable development goals. the poorest and most vulnerable nations legitimately aspire to development, and we must all commit to achieving the goals that have been established for 2030. 16/55 15-29658 01/10/2015 a/70/pv.22 specifically with respect to the small island developing states, of which cabo verde is an example, some essential elements will have to be considered, namely, the threat to their survival posed by climate change, their particular vulnerability to natural disasters, the risk of losing their biodiversity, the reduced size of their markets, the high cost of transportation and energy infrastructure, and their difficulties in accessing financing. for all these reasons, they deserve special attention from the united nations system in the context of the sustainable development goals. the 2030 agenda for sustainable development is a source of hope for the billions of human beings who aspire to a more just, equitable and inclusive world. the will to place people at the centre of development means that we must find appropriate instruments and consistent practices in a sustainable environmental framework. in the light of the unequivocal correlation between sustainable development and climate change, cabo verde, like other small and vulnerable countries, hopes that the declarations and expressions of intent will translate into tangible commitments that lead to the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions but also provide a balanced approach to the issues of adaptation and mitigation. meanwhile, the new agreement that is expected to be signed in paris must not fail to give due weight to the issues of loss and compensation, development, technology transfer and capacity- building, and indicate clearly some reliable sources of financial support for the most vulnerable nations. we are firmly committed to assuming our responsibilities and making our contributions in that respect. in cabo verde, we have already established the goal of 100 per cent renewable energy and are on our way to achieving it, with international cooperation and united nations monitoring. at this time, we have approximately 30 per cent renewable energy on the grid and believe that we will exceed 50 per cent by 2020. much to our consternation, serious cases of human rights violations are occurring in various parts of the world. it is unfortunate that, although almost seventy years have elapsed since the universal declaration of human rights saw the light of day, the promises made when that basic text was adopted have yet to be fulfilled. cabo verde is proud to serve as a benchmark in terms of freedoms, democracy, the rule of law, respect for and defence of human rights, and the promotion of human dignity. peace and security, together with political stability, are essential foundations for the development and the well-being of our peoples. we are therefore growing increasingly concerned about the spread of ongoing conflicts and tensions in africa and the middle east, which have caused thousands of people to flee, driven by total desperation. in seeking better living conditions, some find death instead. those ongoing events have exposed the profound economic, social, political, environmental and humanitarian causes and ramifications of the crisis. the global refugee problem is a great challenge for humankind and requires the engagement of all. the scourge and stigma of war not only affect the well-being of peoples in their own countries, but also create broader instability, disrupting the development of entire regions. cabo verde joins those who call for the rapid settlement of the conflicts, based on a combination of collective efforts and respect for international law and, in particular, the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees and its 1967 protocol. the situation in the middle east continues to deteriorate, with no end in sight to the various conflicts that are sweeping the region. the violations of human rights by the actors in the syrian conflict, as well as the atrocities that are being perpetrated in the territories under the control of terrorist factions and religious fundamentalists, are a major cause for concern. the united nations must redouble its efforts to reach negotiated solutions to that and other conflicts that offend our common sense of humanity. resolving the problem of terrorism requires the international community to step up its actions in combating terrorism and extremism in all their forms and manifestations. we firmly condemn all expressions of terrorism and, in particular, the barbaric actions of extremist groups in the middle east, asia and africa. because cabo verde is an archipelago nation, the sea plays a crucial role in the history, identity and subsistence of the people, providing vital natural resources and connecting the ten islands that form the archipelago. as a small island developing state, cabo verde relies on its partnership with the international community in confronting such maritime security challenges as those posed by trafficking and related crimes and in preserving and managing our seas. i would like to draw the assemblys attention to an exemplary action of regional cooperation in september 2014, when seven west african states, including 15-29658 17/55 a/70/pv.22 01/10/2015 cabo verde, notified the secretary-general in a joint communication that we wished to extend the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond the distance of 200 nautical miles, pursuant to article 76 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea. last august, we had the opportunity to make a technical presentation to the commission on the limits of the continental shelf and expect to receive a favourable response soon. cabo verde welcomes the fact that a working group is studying issues relating to the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction with a view to the development of a legally binding international convention (resolution 66/288, para. 162). the world has great and renewed expectations for the organizations role not only in maintaining international peace and security, but also in promoting development and creating a more prosperous and unified international society by reducing injustice and inequities, eradicating poverty, promoting human rights and combating the effects of climate change. we do indeed believe that the united nations is essential. a more sustainable world living in peace and security is possible.",Cabo Verde,Africa,86.7902908325195,4.806220054626465,1371.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.4587892049598834
MOZ,70,2015,"it is with great honour that, once again, on behalf of the people of mozambique and, indeed, on my own behalf, i address the general assembly at its seventieth session. as we celebrate 70 years of our organization, we are cognizant of the fact that we are not here just to commemorate a mere event. we are also celebrating the realization of the desire to build a universal organization that carries out activities with a global perspective and with a structured and institutionalized scope and a capacity to evolve and adapt. we are celebrating one of the wisest decisions that humankind has ever made, namely, to establish an international body responsible for peace, security and the development of member countries. it is an organization created to prevent humankind from experiencing a world war or violent conflicts whose effects are felt at the global level. we are celebrating a mutual commitment to strengthen international law as an instrument for regulating and standardizing relations between and among states. those relations are based on the principle of sovereign equality among states, the peaceful settlement of disputes and non-interference in domestic affairs. those positive and inspiring ideals contrast, however, with the prevailing conflict situations, which still affect humankind. we would not be fair to ourselves, to our peoples or to future generations, if we ignored the challenges and failures that are to be overcome. the united nations has failed to guarantee international peace and security in its full sense. old and new challenges have emerged, and inter- and intra-state conflicts have proliferated, particularly in africa and the middle east. the phenomenon of terrorism is growing and becoming the most serious threat of our time. decolonization is yet to be completed. underdevelopment, exacerbated by the problem of refugees and illegal migration, is far from becoming a thing of the past. however, those failures should not be regarded fatalistically. they should be taken up as challenges, which require more than mere words as a response. most importantly, they require concerted action by the international community. without the united nations, the political, economic and social context in which we find ourselves would surely be worse. in celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the united nations, the theme for this session, a new commitment to action, represents a reaffirmation of our commitment to keep alive our objective of protecting future generations from the violence of war and to ensure inclusive social and economic development in full freedom. there is, therefore, one response to those phenomena and trends, and that is to translate the theme, a new commitment to action, into concrete, structured and tangible actions. for mozambique, the commitment to action in the area of international peace and security includes, inter alia, the adoption and implementation of effective structures for the prevention and management of conflicts, as well as the need to conclude a convention against terrorism. the emphasis should be on preventive diplomacy. the commitment to action that we are celebrating here should establish platforms for dialogue among cultures and civilizations as an essential tool for promoting tolerance, the culture of peace and a dignified and peaceful world. with respect to development, we are delighted at the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda in the form of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development (resolution 70/1), which is our new global development framework for the next 15 years. it is an agenda that follows and builds on the millennium development goals, which have guided us over the past 15 years. therefore, any action we take in future should not ignore the successes achieved and lessons learned. like other countries, mozambique has achieved remarkable progress in the implementation of the millennium development goals. we have expanded access to education, improved gender balance in access to primary education and met the target set for infant- mortality reduction. the new post-2015 development agenda embodies our collective ambition to transform the world by 2030. the new agenda brings back human dignity by fighting poverty and protecting people and the planet. at the core of the new agenda is the culmination of a series of negotiation processes, at the global level, on climate change. the new post-2015 development agenda is perfectly in line with our governments five-year programme. it is not an end in itself, but it has the added value of focusing on people. it is founded on the so-called sustainable development pillars, namely, the economic, social and environmental dimensions. it is our desire that we should meet in 2030, at another historic event just like this one, to celebrate the implementation of the goals and common vision, as reflected in the new agenda, whose full title is transforming our world: the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. if that is to be possible, mozambique maintains that, among other things, it is of paramount importance that the commitment to action include the need to mobilize the requisite resources in a timely manner. significant resources will be required for the implementation of the new agenda if it is to maintain continuous relevance. in that regard, we must follow the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and keep in mind how important it is that all partners respect the commitments made and the agreed international development goals. it is also important that the appropriate technology transfers to developing countries take place and that aid be granted without political conditionalities. we must also strengthen north-south, south-south, and bilateral and multilateral cooperation mechanisms in accordance with internationally agreed principles and respect for national realities and local content. as all may be aware, mozambique was one of the 50 countries selected by the united nations to host national consultations. that sample contributed to the development of the new guiding instrument that is the 2030 agenda for sustainable development (resolution 70/1). the process included the broadest spectrum of social and professional elements, and, to our satisfaction, its results were taken into consideration in the report of the secretary-general (a/70/1). if the post-2015 development agenda is to be truly transformative and successful, it must be integrated into and owned by policymaking instruments at the national level. indicators and targets should be defined clearly to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of progress. mozambique has already taken an important step by incorporating the three-dimensional approach of the post-2015 development agenda into the governments five-year programme 2015-2019, which defines five priorities, namely: consolidating national unity, peace and sovereignty; developing human and social capital; promoting employment, productivity and competitiveness; developing economic and social infrastructures; and ensuring the sustainable and transparent management of natural resources and the environment. we reiterate here our commitment to continued capacity-building in the area of domestic resources mobilization, which increased from 13 per cent of our gross domestic product in 2006 to 25 per cent in 2014. the inability of the united nations to fully achieve the purpose for which it was established is one of the issues that concern us. it is hard to understand why the united nations is hampering the implementation of its own mandate. we should be here today to celebrate the completion of the reform of the security council and the opening up of new opportunities to create a world in which people enjoy the most basic rights, including peace and development. the role of that reform in providing underlying support for the successful implementation of the post-2015 development agenda should not be underestimated. we should therefore translate our renewed mutual will to reform the security council into practical results, and we should take advantage of the environment created for this session to provide greater dynamism to the reform process. the celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the united nations and the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda are being overshadowed by an unprecedented crisis at the international level. i am referring to the humanitarian crisis caused by a flow of refugees and migrants that is unparalleled in recent history. that shocking situation is due to a succession of unresolved crises and to poorly handled situations with outcomes that are far from meeting the expectations of the international community. today we are committed to adopting measures to minimize the plight of those people. however, little will be achieved if we continue to focus on short-term cosmetic measures, rather than respond to the need to curtail the flow of refugees and migrants at the source. we need to address the underlying problems of this phenomenon, which explain the tragic human proportions of the crisis. we will be in no position to identify effective actions unless we, the international community, recognize our own failure. we are talking about the proliferation of conflicts and political, social and economic exclusion. we are talking about poverty, injustice and hunger. we have noted how dialogue has been replaced by threats and aggression. we have noted how fear has replaced a willingness to achieve mutual agreement. some of the ways to address the situation have been known for a long time. in that regard, we call upon all leaders to redouble their efforts to find lasting solutions to the humanitarian crisis. we have followed with keen interest and much satisfaction the latest positive developments aimed at normalizing bilateral relations between the united states of america and cuba. we continue to encourage actions aimed at ending the economic, trade and financial embargo against cuba, without prejudice to the legitimate interests of any of those concerned. although we may meet all of the targets of the post-2015 development agenda, our mission as an international community will not be complete until we use wisdom and implement the political processes. as is well known, mozambique was one of the countries most affected by the presence of landmines. in acknowledgement of the importance of mine clearance for promoting an atmosphere of peace, security and development, mozambique became a party to the convention on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction, also known as the ottawa convention. from the outset, we have made every effort to comply with the obligations arising from the ottawa convention. in that regard, i am pleased to announce that mozambique has successfully completed its demining programme. we have cleared all known risk areas, which totalled 500 million square metres of land. it would not have been worthwhile for us to liberate our country if then we had been forbidden to travel across our country, or if we had been forbidden to farm the land or develop tourism or mine our coal or graphite. we celebrate that victory with intense emotion. we would like to express our profound gratitude to our international partners, humanitarian demining organizations, united nations agencies and civil society for their cooperation and invaluable support. the year 2015 is of special importance to mozambique. on 25 june, we celebrated 40 years of independence. we are no longer an adolescent state. on 16 september we celebrated 40 years of cooperation with the united nations. i am jubilant because i am speaking here today, at the united nations, and i believe that the united nations should feel proud on account of my countrys stability and growth growth that needs to be supported. i would like to conclude my remarks by reiterating that the search for sustainable solutions to global problems, alongside the organization and its member states, will continue to be the focus of my governments unconditional commitment. long live humankind and sustainable development!",Mozambique,Africa,56.0390014648438,5.915156605752975,1900.0,14.0,0.0,14.0,7.368421052631579
ZAF,70,2015,"i should like to congratulate the president and his country, denmark, on his election as president of the general assembly at its seventieth session. he has south africas full support for his presidency. the theme that he has chosen, the united nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human rights, is timely and relevant to the current global challenges facing the world today. furthermore, allow me to convey our gratitude to the president of the assembly at its sixty-ninth session, mr. sam kutesa of the republic of uganda, for the outstanding manner in which he represented africa at the helm of the general assembly during that session. the seventieth anniversary of the united nations marks a significant moment in the history of global governance. the charter embodies, through its principles and objectives, the aspirations of oppressed people worldwide. we would also like to acknowledge the role of the united nations general assembly over the past 70 years. rooted in the principle of sovereign equality, the assembly is the most representative international institution and organ of the united nations. the general assembly has over the years remained central to the provision of support to the disadvantaged, marginalized, occupied, colonized and oppressed peoples of the world. this body elevated the south african struggle for liberation internationally when it declared apartheid a crime against humanity. mr. oliver tambo, the former president of our liberation movement, the african national congress, addressed the general assembly from this very podium on 26 october 1976 (see a/31/pv.41) and spoke from other united nations platforms as well on other occasions. many other eminent south africans were provided an opportunity in various united nations forums to state our case for freedom, the united nations providing a voice to the voiceless. a free south africa has also been honoured by the declaration of 18 july as international mandela day, honouring our founding president and world icon, president nelson mandela. at this celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the united nations i wish to extend, on behalf of the people of south africa, our sincere gratitude to the world for its contribution to our freedom from the shackles of apartheid and institutionalized racism. the general assembly continues to provide a voice for the voiceless and the oppressed. in an historic and landmark development the general assembly approved a resolution to allow the palestinian flag to fly in front of united nations headquarters (resolution 69/320). the resolution was passed by an overwhelming margin, supported by many nations from both the developed north and the developing south. there can be no peace, security and development in the middle east without a resolution of the palestinian question. a solution is urgent. otherwise, if we delay, in the next decade we may no longer have a piece of land to justify the two- state solution. the historic seventieth anniversary of the united nations presents an opportunity to reflect on the structure and workings of the organization. significantly, this year marks the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the world summit outcome (resolution 60/1) in 2005, which discussed reform of the united nations. a number of significant decisions on reform have been successfully implemented since that summit. they include the following: the replacement of the human rights commission with a more effective human rights council, the establishment of the peacebuilding commission as a subsidiary body of both the general assembly and the security council, the reform and streamlining of the united nations management system, the mainstreaming of gender equality through the establishment of the united nations entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women (un-women),and the membership-driven responsibility to protect and to assist populations facing genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and ethnic cleansing. we welcome that notable progress. however, almost no progress has been made on the commitment also made by heads of state and government in 2005 to the early reform of the security council. it is unacceptable and unjustifiable that more than 1 billion people in the african continent are still excluded from permanent membership in the key decision-making structure of the united nations, the security council. a continent with a smaller population than africa is represented by three countries on the security council as permanent members. that is unfair. the united nations cannot pretend that the world has not changed since 1945. we are no longer colonies. we are free, independent sovereign states. we welcome the fact that the push for the reform of the security council coming from africa has had an impact and has given some impetus to the intergovernmental negotiations process that has been looking at the reforms. we will continue working with progressive states towards the expansion of representation. another critical matter that needs attention is the selection of the secretary-general, who is appointed by the general assembly on the recommendation of the security council. a review of that process is necessary so as to enable more meaningful participation on the part of the general assembly in the process. the president has identified human rights, governance, the rule of law, and the gender aspects of the work of the united nations as important areas of focus for the seventieth session of the general assembly. we have to build upon the initial work undertaken in the development of the universal declaration of human rights in 1948 to enhance protection in areas such as racism, discrimination against women and the promotion of the rights of the child and the rights of people with disabilities. we also believe that the united nations human rights system, especially its human rights council, should ensure a balance between civil and political rights, on the one hand, and economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, on the other. the human rights council must also be seen as an independent and impartial mechanism for the entrenchment of a human rights culture throughout the world. it should avoid the pitfalls of its predecessor, the commission on human rights, which was beset by politicization and was caught up in the divide between developed and developing countries. this year also marks 50 years since the adoption of the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination. the year 2015 also marks 60 years since the adoption of the freedom charter in south africa, which embodies the fundamental principles and values that are now enshrined in our constitution. south africa will continue to champion efforts in the united nations human rights system to combat the scourges of racism, xenophobia, racial discrimination and related intolerances and to support work aimed at the promotion of substantive global equality. the seventieth general debate takes place in the context of growing international concern about the rise of violent extremism, terrorism and untold brutality, which we strongly condemn. we welcome the meetings that will take place on the margins of the general assembly to review the progress made in countering terrorism in the middle east and north africa. we wish to emphasize that the security council must take into account the views of the african continent and its subregional organizations when dealing with conflicts in africa in future. the current situation in libya and the sahel region is a direct consequence of the failure of some members of the council to heed informed counsel from the african union. the norm of responsibility to protect was abused for narrow political interests that had nothing to do with the fundamental aspects of the prevention of mass atrocities. the current refugee crisis in europe is, sadly, the direct result of the militarization of civilian unrest, which included the massive arming of civilians and opposition groups in libya, syria and other affected countries. that kind of problem is a deliberately man- made problem, and it is critical that, in discussing violent extremism and terrorism in parts of africa and the middle east, we look into the root causes of the problem and not just the symptoms. also requiring our serious reflection is the regime change doctrine and its role in perpetuating conflicts and instability in various parts of our continent and the world. we welcome the recently signed peace agreement between the parties in south sudan and urge the united nations and all stakeholders to support the sudanese people as they work to resolve their challenges. we reaffirm our support for the people of western sahara and urge the international community to encourage their struggle for self-determination, freedom, human rights and dignity. we also welcome the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between cuba and the united states and the release of the cuban five. we reiterate our call for the lifting of the economic and financial embargo to help the cuban people to gain their economic freedom. we acknowledge the contribution of his holiness pope francis to the cuban-united states normalization process. we also warmly welcome the contribution of the holy father generally to the global pursuit of peace, justice and the end of poverty and suffering, as eloquently expressed in the general assembly and globally. we commend the united nations for the key role that it has played in peacekeeping and urge that resources be prioritized for this core role of the united nations, especially in africa. the failure of the parties to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons to reach an agreement at the 2015 review conference in the year that marks 70 years since the first atomic bombs were detonated in japan is a major setback to our commitment to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons. there can be no safe hands where nuclear weapons are concerned. the humanitarian consequences of a possible detonation of a nuclear weapon, whether intentional or accidental, will be catastrophic for humankind. we welcome the recent agreement reached on the iranian nuclear programme and the recognition of the right of iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. the seventieth session of the general assembly has seen the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda. the outcome document represents a victory for the developing world, as it affirms that the 2030 agenda for sustainable development (resolution 70/1) should build on the unfinished business of the millennium development goals. additionally, while the 2030 agenda is universal in its scope in that the sustainable development goals adopted apply to both developed and developing countries, there is also a clear recognition of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities. the agenda also contains a specific goal on achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. that is all the more appropriate given that this year is the twentieth anniversary of the beijing platform for action and the fifteenth anniversary of security council resolution 1325 (2000), on women, peace and security. as the initiator of the durban platform for enhanced action thanks to which the current round of negotiations under the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) is taking place south africa has a special interest in and commitment to the success of the paris session of the conference of the parties later this year. we require the fulfilment of all three parts of the durban mandate, namely, the closing of the current ambition gap in the pre-2020 period through the honouring of existing legal obligations by developed countries and enhanced action; the entry into force of the second commitment period of the kyoto protocol; and the adoption in paris of a new agreement for the post-2020 period that contains all the essential elements, including the means of implementation and the measures relating to loss, damage and response. we seek a fair, ambitious and legally binding agreement in paris that is applicable to all parties. in addition, south africa, as chair of the g-77 plus china, would not be able to accept a paris package that is hollow or weak on finance. south africa has submitted its intended nationally determined contribution to the unfccc secretariat ahead of the 1 october deadline, signalling our readiness for paris. we join the world in celebrating the 70 years of existence of the united nations. as we mark this historic anniversary, the reform of the security council and the strengthening of the general assembly and other organs remain a paramount concern. by the end of this session, we should be in a position to adopt a road map, with clear and implementable time frames, on the priorities of this organization as well as on its reform. we need to do this in order for the united nations to remain a relevant force and a force for change in the world. in conclusion, let me express our deep appreciation of the offer made by china when it was addressing the assembly, an offer that must go through the united nations. china spelled out the support it intended to give to africa: a total of $100 million of free military assistance to the african union over the next five years to support the establishment of the african standby force and the african capacity for immediate response to crises. we would like to underline our gratitude to china.",South Africa,Africa,94.367919921875,5.482850074768066,2187.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.45724737082761774
MWI,70,2015,"it gives me great pleasure to congratulate mr. mogens lukketoft on his election to preside over the general assembly at its seventieth session. his credentials are impeccable, and i am confident that he will steer the assemblys affairs to a successful conclusion, with all his objectives and aspirations fulfilled. i would like to assure him of my delegations support. i would also like to thank his excellency mr. sam kutesa of our sister country uganda, the outgoing president of the general assembly, for his untiring efforts during his presidency. his dedication to the work of the united nations is commendable. and i reiterate malawis support for the secretary-general as he strives to realize the purposes of the charter of the united nations. the theme of this years general debate, the united nations at 70 a new commitment to action, comes at a very opportune time, for it fittingly summarizes the core business of the united nations at its inception, today and in the future that is, the maintenance of international peace and security. the united nations was created on the understanding that peace is not just the absence of war; it comes with the struggles, compromises, sacrifices and choices we make as nations and as individuals for the benefit of humanity. we cannot realize a complete sense of peace without justice, dignity and freedom. we can rejoice that in the 70 years of the work of the united nations, we have collectively averted another world war. however, during the same period, we have lived in fear and uncertainty, in a world tainted by the conflicts, poverty and violence that have endangered our very existence. as we live in this imperfect world, the pursuit of peace should be our main goal if we are to shape a promising life for our future generations. i would therefore like to commend the secretary-general for convening the high-level independent panel on peace operations, aimed at reviewing current united nations operations and considering emerging future needs in the prevention and resolution of conflicts. the panels report (a/70/95), submitted in june, has highlighted some important issues that i feel that we, as part of the global family, should consider and take seriously. i would like to mention just a few of those issues demanding our attention as members of the united nations. first, peace operations should be guided by a focus on political solutions, in which the emphasis should be on conflict prevention through political means, with a bias towards people-centred solutions as well as the protection of civilians. secondly, there is a need for comprehensive peace and security partnerships that involve the security council, regional actors and national mechanisms. thirdly, the world, through the united nations, should find a way to compensate people who have suffered abuse. fourthly, there is a need for greater political will on the part of all actors in peace missions. let me now touch on another important issue that has been on the agenda of the united nations for quite some time, that is, reform of the security council. i have followed with keen interest the intergovernmental negotiations on how the security council can be reformed to make it more representative, democratic, effective, transparent and accountable to all. the ezulwini consensus and the sirte declaration are our guiding principles in that endeavour. our quest for peace and security should be hinged on sustainable socioeconomic development for our people that has true meaning and reflects the lives of our people. despite varied progress among member states, and developing countries in particular, the millennium development goals (mdgs) have proved that unity of purpose is critical to transforming the world into a better place for our children and future generations. my government is grateful to development partners that have worked to help malawi achieve four of the 38/51 15-29431 29/09/2015 a/70/pv.16 eight mdgs: reducing child mortality, combating hiv/aids, malaria and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability and developing a global partnership for development. it is evident that as a country we are embarking on the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda with unfinished business. it is therefore imperative, as we move to implement the new global development agenda, to be mindful of the important role that global partnerships can play in effective development cooperation, thereby ensuring the successful implementation of development programmes in the developing countries. we in malawi are also glad to reiterate the fact that, as we look to the sustainable development goals, we can draw international pride and inspiration from our collective achievements on mdg 6, which involves halting and reversing the hiv/aids epidemic. under that goal, we aimed to put 15 million people on treatment globally, and today we can stand here and boldly declare that we have met that target. as we look to the sustainable development agenda, we must commit, as the international community, to putting an end to aids as a public health threat and finishing the business of hiv/aids by 2030. my government has already committed to doing so, and current evidence shows that malawi is well on the way to achieving that goal. together, we can end aids by 2030, but it will require conducting business as unusual and fast-tracking hiv responses, in line with the evidence of what works. but more importantly, it will require continued shared responsibility and global solidarity in financing hiv programmes and enhancing the capacity of developing countries such as malawi to manufacture the drugs and make them more accessible to our people. having said that, let me also reiterate what i have always maintained that all of the aforementioned wonderful programmes will be realized when we, as a global family, do not leave our youth and women behind. in malawi and, i believe, in almost all developing countries, young people and women constitute the majority of the population. it is therefore only natural that they be adequately represented at all decision-making levels of society. the late president mandela of south africa once said, as long as a nation refuses to acknowledge the equal role of more than half of itself, it is doomed to failure. that is a fact and i could not agree with it more. let me commend president xi jinping of china, and the secretary-general, through the office of un-women, for organizing on the margins of this session the global leaders meeting on gender equality and womens empowerment: a commitment to action, under the theme planet 50-50 by 2030: step it up for gender equality, to which a number of leaders, including malawis, made national commitments. my government is committed to the he for she campaign to address gender inequality, end gender- based violence, promote womens political participation and facilitate womens economic empowerment. it has therefore been singled out as one of the core priority areas of our revised malawi growth and development strategy the blueprint of malawis development. malawi also took advantage of the forum to host a side high-level event to share perspectives on demographic dividends and investing in youth, which we hope will successfully lead to improved coordination, commitment and support for youth empowerment and development for africa. we have expressed the desire for shared prosperity and well-being and unity and integration, for a continent where the full potential of women and youth are realized with freedom from fear, disease and want. as others taking the floor earlier have noted, two days ago we adopted the sustainable development goals (sdgs). that was brilliant. however, allow me to highlight sdg 4, which speaks of education. as a champion of higher education in africa, i wish to reiterate in no uncertain terms that all of the brilliant resolutions and decisions coming out of this great forum, and many similar ones across the world, will fall flat if countries ignore the task of educating the people, especially young people and, even more so, girl children. in that vein, i am pleased to note that sustainable development goal 4 is about ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning. however, it does not fully capture the centrality of higher education in achieving the wider sustainable development goals and targets. allow me to express gratitude to those partners that continue to stand with us to promote higher education in africa. with improved and increased access to higher education, the world will strike a massive blow at poverty. in fulfilling its national and international responsibility, my government recognizes the cross- cutting role of respecting and protecting peoples 15-29431 39/51 a/70/pv.16 29/09/2015 human rights and the rule of law. my government will continue to promote human rights, inter alia, by enhancing awareness of human rights, promoting equitable access to opportunity and strengthening legal protections. the full enjoyment of peoples human rights cannot be achieved in a society full of fraud, corruption and theft of public resources. those vices must be dealt with in order to protect peoples human rights and ensure the delivery of expected services from their government. our government has therefore always been committed to fighting corruption, fraud and theft. it is against that background that we are pursuing and prosecuting suspects for the theft of public funds. may god bless the united nations family.",Malawi,Africa,62.1435394287109,3.444496670571785,1529.0,15.0,0.0,15.0,9.810333551340745
MUS,71,2016,"it pleases me at the outset to convey my heartfelt congratulations to his excellency mr. peter thomson on his election as president of the general assembly at its seventy-first session. i also seize this opportunity to extend my sincere gratitude to his excellency mr. ban ki-moon for his exemplary stewardship of the organization as secretary-general throughout the past decade. as he leaves office at the end of this year, i wish him the very best in his future endeavours. he will be remembered for the rich legacy that he is leaving behind. last year, the assembly adopted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, setting new benchmarks that will shape our future. we acknowledged the importance of every goal, every target and every indicator as steps towards a better world. our collective response and our solidarity in the face of the challenges that will arise as we try to carve out a sustainable world will determine whether we succeed in achieving the sustainable development goals (sdgs). each country has its priorities and will need to formulate a unique set of actions in order to achieve the universal goals that we have set for ourselves. in that context, the united nations will have an important role to play in supporting the efforts of individual countries. in mauritius, we have chosen to focus our attention primarily on the eradication of extreme forms of poverty. my government, with the support of the united nations development programme, has already undertaken to establish a social register of those living in dismal conditions and who require targeted measures and assistance. as a first unprecedented measure, we have introduced in this years national budget a subsistence allowance for the extreme poor based on a threshold of 2,720 mauritian rupees per adult. that threshold is 40 per cent higher than the world bank international extreme poverty line of of $3.10 per day per individual, calculated on the basis of purchasing power parity. there are yet many miles to go, and we will resolutely pursue our journey towards attaining all of the sdgs by working together with the private sector and civil society. we are fully committed to creating a more equitable system, to safeguarding rule of law and to ensuring equal access to justice for all, as encapsulated in goal 16 on peace and justice. the united nations will be tested in the effort to achieve goal 16 on an international scale, for we are conscious of the power of might against right. nevertheless, mauritius will persevere in its fight for the vulnerable. for a small island developing state like ours, goal 13 on climate action and goal 14 on the oceans are of paramount importance for our survival. we are pleased that we have now crossed the first threshold for the entry into force of the paris agreement on climate change. the 60 countries that have ratified the agreement are responsible for 47.76 per cent of global emissions. for small island developing states (sids), the early entry into force of the paris agreement is of paramount importance. the tourism industry in sids faces particular challenges owing to the negative effects of global warming. taking measures to reverse that trend is essential to us in order to preserve marine and coastal ecosystems and biodiversity, and to foster the clean and sustainable use of our oceans. mauritius will ensure that the steps it takes to advance its ocean economy are in synergy with sustainability principles. in that context, i am pleased to inform the assembly that on 1 and 2 september mauritius, with the support of the world bank, hosted the african ministerial conference on ocean economies and climate change. the mauritius communique, which encapsulates the outcome of the conference, will serve as an input for the green climate fund africa dialogue to be held next month in cape town. mauritius will also contribute to the discussions at the african union extraordinary summit on maritime security and safety and development in africa, scheduled for 15 october in togo, and at the conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, from 7 to 18 november, in morocco. let me highlight the fact that during the conference in mauritius, african ministers, along with our development partners in particular the world bank group, the african development bank and the food and agriculture organization of the united nations agreed that a technical and financial assistance package is imperative in order to support ocean economies and ensure the resilience of oceans and coastal areas to climate change. we look forward to the adoption of such a package at the climate change conference in morocco. addressing the causes and effects of climate change will require robust determination and strong political will, as well as extraordinary means, in terms of both financing and technology transfer. we highly appreciate the pledges made by countries such as france and canada to provide financing to fight climate change. however, access to those resources needs to be simplified and needs to take into account the specific circumstances of individual countries. two days ago, mauritius and the commonwealth secretariat signed a host country agreement for the establishment in mauritius of a climate finance access hub, as had been decided at the commonwealth heads of government meeting held in malta in november 2015. the hub will help small island developing states and least developed countries to unlock critical climate funds. all our efforts to make our planet sustainable and to leave a proud legacy for future generations will be in vain if we are unable to maintain peace and security in the world and if we do not adhere to the invaluable principles of the rule of law and democracy. that is why mauritius vehemently condemns, without reservation, the multiple acts of terrorism and violent extremism in all their forms. we believe that a reformed united nations, including a comprehensive reform of the security council, is essential to the global capacity to respond effectively to terrorist threats and new situations. an enlarged and more representative security council will further strengthen the united nations role in furthering peace and security and the rule of law across the globe. mauritius adheres to the african position on the reform of the security council, as elaborated in the ezulwini consensus. we believe that the historical injustice done to africa with regard to representation on the council should be redressed. we also support a dedicated seat for sids. in addition, mauritius fully supports indias aspiration to a permanent seat. while the formal recognition of palestine by the united nations as an observer is a very positive development, we must exert relentless efforts to work towards the goal of having two distinct, independent, secure and viable states, palestine and israel, living peacefully side by side. the firm belief of mauritius in the charter of the united nations and in the legitimacy of a fair and just multilateral system is unshakable. every nation has a right to peace, justice, the rule of law and democracy, and every human being has the right to basic human rights. that is the basis on which the mauritius constitution is built. those are also the principles enshrined in the charter. the full realization of those principles will not be possible, however, unless complete decolonization is accomplished. it was 48 years ago that my country became a free and sovereign nation, an independent country in the eyes of the world. yet even today, it is unable to exercise its sovereignty over parts of its territory, namely, the chagos archipelago and tromelin island. on 8 november 1965, prior to granting mauritius its independence on 12 march 1968, the united kingdom illegally excised the chagos archipelago from the territory of mauritius, purportedly in order to create the so-called british indian ocean territory. that excision was carried out in violation of international law and general assembly resolutions 1514 (xv) of 14 december 1960, 2066 (xx) of 16 december 1965, 2232 (xxi) of 20 december 1966, and 2357 (xxii) of 19 december 1967. resolution 1514 (xv) stipulates that any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the charter of the united nations. it clearly prohibits the dismemberment of any colonial territory prior to independence. in addition to excising that integral part of our territory, the mauritians living in the chagos archipelago were forcibly evicted from their home and moved to the main island of mauritius in total disregard for their human rights. the government of mauritius is fully sensitive to their plight and their rightful aspiration to resettle in the chagos archipelago, as per their legitimate right as citizens of mauritius. we are determined to resettle those who were forcibly evicted from the archipelago upon its return to the effective control of mauritius, in full respect of all their rights and dignity. my delegation includes the spokesperson for mauritians of chagossian origin. he represents a whole community whose human rights have been flouted. his presence also testifies to the fact that the issue of sovereignty and the right of return of mauritian chagossians to their native lands cannot be dissociated. mauritius has consistently protested against the illegal excision of the chagos archipelago and has unequivocally maintained that the chagos archipelago, including the island of diego garcia, forms an integral part of its territory, under both mauritian law and international law. mauritius has also consistently pressed for the completion of the decolonization process. for decades, mauritius has called on the former colonial power to engage with us in order to find a fair and just solution, but our efforts have been in vain so far. despite the blatant violation of resolution 1514 (xv), the united kingdom maintains that its continued presence in the chagos archipelago is lawful. yet the united kingdom also tacitly admits the impropriety of its action in dismembering the territory of mauritius, as evidenced by the undertaking which it has given on various occasions that the chagos archipelago will be returned to mauritius when no longer required for defence purposes. that undertaking has been held to be legally binding by the arbitral tribunal established in the case brought by mauritius against the united kingdom under the united nations convention on the law of the sea to challenge the legality of the marine protected area purportedly established by the united kingdom around the chagos archipelago. however, the united kingdom has not honoured that undertaking so far, it keeps changing the criteria, which rely on the contention that the use of the chagos archipelago is still required for defence purposes. the arbitral tribunal ruled that the creation of the purported marine protected area around the chagos archipelago by the united kingdom was in violation of international law. two of the arbitrators found that the excision of the chagos archipelago from mauritius in 1965 showed a complete disregard for the territorial integrity of mauritius by the united kingdom, in violation of the right to self determination, and that the united kingdom is not the coastal state in relation to the chagos archipelago. that finding was not contradicted by the other two members of the arbitral tribunal. the general assembly has a direct institutional interest in the matter, given the historic and central role that it has played in the process of decolonization throughout the world. the assembly has a continuing responsibility to complete the process of decolonization, including that of mauritius. that is why, at the request of the government of mauritius, the general assembly has included in the agenda of its seventy-first session item 87, request for an advisory opinion of the international court of justice on the legal consequences of the separation of the chagos archipelago from mauritius in 1965. an advisory opinion would assist the assembly in its work on decolonization in general and the decolonization of mauritius in particular, pursuant to the requirements of the charter of the united nations and international law. i would like to insist on the fact that the decision to have recourse to that action was not taken with an adversarial intent. this is not the first time that an advisory opinion of the international court of justice is being sought on such a subject. in our view, the procedure represents a legitimate recourse, and it abides by the provisions of the charter and past practice of the united nations. we have noted that the united kingdom has now expressed the wish to engage in dialogue with mauritius in order to sort the matter out by june 2017. mauritius has always believed in true dialogue. we are acting in good faith, and we expect the same from our interlocutors. we believe that the assembly has the duty to assist in the completion of the decolonization process. mauritius is of the view that an advisory opinion of the international court of justice in respect of the chagos archipelago will undoubtedly assist the assembly in the discharge of that responsibility. i wish to heartily thank member states of the african union, the african, caribbean and pacific group of states, the non-aligned group, and the group of 77 and china, among others, which have openly expressed their support to my country. i know that when it comes to justice, human dignity and territorial integrity, the assembly will live up to its mission. we concur with the position of the united kingdom on a rule-based international system. however, we have to be coherent, not only in what we say, but also in what we do. the decolonization of mauritius will also not be fully resolved until the issue of tromelin is settled. we have had very constructive dialogue with france, and we urge france to pursue that dialogue with mauritius for the early resolution of the dispute over the island in the continued spirit of friendship that has characterized the relationship between our two countries. territorial integrity is a principle of international law. the united nations recognizes it as such, it is therefore our duty to ensure that it is respected. to conclude, i would like to call on the entire membership of the united nations to stand by the right to justice, to show that a better and safer world is possible only when it is compatible with the rule of law, and to show commitment to the principles of the charter.",Mauritius,Africa,93.1578369140625,4.882070064544678,2403.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.2484394506866416
TCD,71,2016,"allow me at the outset to congratulate his excellency mr. peter thomson, permanent representative of fiji, who has been elected president of the general assembly at its seventy-first session. we wish him every success in discharging his mandate. chad pledges its full support. i would also like to congratulate and thank his excellency mr. mogens lykketoft, outgoing president of the general assembly, for his dedication and his many initiatives to strengthen the role of the assembly, the most democratic and representative entity of the united nations. at the same time, on behalf of chad and the african union, i would like to congratulate and render a heartfelt tribute to his excellency secretary-general ban ki-moon, whose mandate will soon come to a close. his leadership, commitment and unflagging dedication during the past 10 years have contributed to buttressing the role of the united nations and promoting its ideals. founded over 70 years ago by 51 member states, the united nations today now consists of 193 member states. the evolution of humankind has made our states 10/56 16-29296 increasingly interdependent and interconnected, just as the challenges have become global and collective in nature. the world in which we live is facing multidimensional threats which prompt great concern. armed conflict, terrorism, climate change, mass migration, underdevelopment, poverty, and political, economic and financial crises have reached unprecedented proportions. no continent or region of the world has been spared by at least one of those scourges. citizens of the world from all walks of life in some cases live in a perpetual state of fear and in others in a state of despair because wars, indiscriminate violence, poverty and the adverse effects of climate change are on the rise and there is slim hope of solving those problems. the growing number of refugees and displaced persons throughout the world; the ongoing shipwrecks of makeshift boats in the mediterranean, resulting in the loss of thousands of lives; and the syrian tragedy, which has been unfolding before our eyes for more than five years, among other challenges, are tangible events that eloquently illustrate our collective powerlessness. in this world of uncertainty, africa is the most vulnerable and exposed continent. the victim of colonial plunder and affected by the numerous problems caused by underdevelopment, africa is today under full attack from terrorism the greatest threat of the century. somalia, libya, mali, the lake chad basin and the sahel in general are seriously destabilized and the danger is threatening to spread throughout the entire continent. despite their modest means, the african union and its member states are highly mobilized and committed to fighting this absolute evil. that is evidenced by the great sacrifices that the african union mission in somalia has made since 2004, the implementation of the multinational joint task force by states of the lake chad basin and benin to fight the boko haram terrorist group, and the establishment of the group of five for the sahel, which is a framework for security cooperation and countering all cross-border threats in the countries of the sahel. this impetus for mobilization should be strengthened and supported by the entire international community by all means available, including physical, financial and military, as well as through intelligence-sharing. in that regard, from this rostrum i appeal to all states members of the united nations, particularly africas partners, to contribute to the african fund against terrorism created by the african union at its summit, held in kigali in july. africa is also working with great diligence to manage the crises and conflicts besetting it by promoting a regional approach to crisis resolution, underpinned by a peace and security architecture. such an approach, which is deserving of the firm support of the international community, seeks to strengthen the response capacity of regional and subregional organizations in the light of their geographical proximity, knowledge of the terrain and their rapid and flexible deployment capabilities. the african union mission in the sudan, the african union mission in somalia, the african-led international support mission in mali and the african-led international support mission in the central african republic are concrete examples of the efforts of the african union. the complexity of conflicts throughout the world, including in africa, is such that no organization can resolve them alone. that is why the african union has always advocated a strategic partnership with the united nations to confront security challenges on the continent. the african union has deployed all of the aforementioned operations on behalf of the international community and in deference to the purview of the security council. consequently, the african union can legitimately count on the multifaceted and financial support of the united nations. we welcome the fact that this long-held position of the african union is endorsed in the high-level independent panel on united nations peace operations in its 20l5 report (see a/70/95), which has been unanimously praised. accordingly, in the spirit of shared responsibility, at its latest summit the african union adopted a measure to shoulder 25 per cent of the cost of peacekeeping operations authorized by the security council on the continent. the african union hopes to receive the remaining 75 per cent from the united nations peacekeeping budget, in keeping with the spirit of the division of labour and cost- sharing. the african union anxiously awaits the start of constructive discussions with the united nations on this proposal in order to reach an agreement that could further strengthen the exemplary partnership between the african union and the united nations in the interests of peace and the protection of civilians in times of crisis. 16-29296 11/56 the political and security situation in many african countries concerns us deeply. mali remains a target of attacks by terrorist groups despite the presence of united nations forces on the ground and the peace agreements reached following arduous negotiations in algiers. the international community must undertake an in-depth analysis of the situation with a view to ending the conflict through dialogue, without losing sight of tailored and appropriate responses to the terrorist threat. the situations in libya and south sudan remains extremely troubling and requires a more substantial mobilization on the part of the international community, with the vigorous engagement and coordination of the respective regional organizations involved in resolving the crises. in that respect, the joint effort of the african union and the united nations to deploy a civilian protection force of 4,000 men, in addition to the united nations mission in south sudan, is to be commended. we also call for more concerted efforts between the african union high-level implementation panel for the sudan and south sudan and the united nations to persuade the non-signatories of the doha document for peace in darfur to commit to it. despite the successful holding of presidential and legislative elections, the situation in the central african republic remains fragile, as evidenced by the latest clashes between armed groups within the country. that situation requires a long-term follow-up, and the newly elected central african authorities must be further supported in their efforts to normalize the situation in their country. i call on the international community to maintain and strengthen its support for peacebuilding and national reconciliation there. we also urge the political actors in brotherly countries, including the democratic republic of the congo, burundi and gabon, to prioritize dialogue and cooperation with regard to pre- and post-electoral crises. the african union is ready to assist them in settling their disputes through peaceful means. the serious crises affecting iraq, syria and yemen call on our collective conscience concerning the many who have been killed, wounded, displaced or made refugees, as well as to the destruction of their vital infrastructure. the international community must urgently find a political solution to all of these crises through direct negotiations between the parties in conflict. concerning the israelipalestinian conflict, we call for a definitive, just and equitable solution that guarantees security for israel and an independent and viable state for palestinians, urging both parties to resume dialogue and relaunch the peace process, and setting out a clear framework for future negotiations, along with a deadline, that will make it possible to put an end to the israeli occupation of palestinian territory. africa is not only a gigantic reservoir of raw materials; it is also home to more than 1 billion men and women who yearn for harmonious development accompanied by social well-being and prosperity. the international community can eradicate poverty in the world only if it upholds the commitments made within the framework of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development (resolution 70/1), which puts people at the very core of all concerns. the implementation of the agenda must be an absolute priority in order to eliminate extreme poverty, fight climate change, strengthen resilience and promote sustainable economic growth that will benefit all. in this respect, we stress the urgent need for an effective mobilization of the resources necessary to finance development in accordance with the addis ababa action agenda. africa is committed to playing its part by ensuring an effective coordination of efforts as well as consistency among the goals of both agenda 2063 and agenda 2030. no region of the world, no state can prosper alone or be surrounded by an ocean of destitution and poverty without experiencing the consequences. the successive waves of young african migrants moving towards europe that we see on a daily basis, thousands of whom have drowned, are a challenge to the conscience of the international community. though we may erect barriers, build ghettos and mobilize naval forces to contain migrants, the phenomenon will not stop until the regions concerned are closely involved in a suitable collective response. the solutions outlined at the 2015 valletta summit seem, unfortunately, to have fallen short of our expectations and of the challenges. it is not a matter of providing charity to africa, but, rather, of establishing with it a true strategic partnership aimed at tackling common global challenges. it is not too late to begin collective and concerted action that takes on board the legitimate concerns of all the parties concerned. 12/56 16-29296 one of the major challenges facing africa is climate change and environmental issues. the advance of the desert, the silting up of the niger river, the el nino phenomenon in southern africa and deforestation are all the most striking signs of climate change in africa. lake chad has shrunk from 25,000 square kilometres in 1960 to less than 2,000 today; this is additional proof of the degradation of our planets climate. this ecological disaster, which is endangering coexistence among communities and dangerously threatening food security in the sahel, will certainly have consequences for the security and the stability of the region, as we see from the strong presence and the accelerated development of the terrorist threat. the partnership with africa must also be seen in the fight for the preservation of the environment, which is seriously threatened. in this respect, the paris agreement on climate change, signed on 22 april by all states, creates new obligations and a structural framework for the long-term fight against climate change. there is a great deal left to do to in order to achieve tangible achievements in the implementation of the commitments undertaken by all parties according to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. the agreement will be credible only if it is accompanied by specific action aimed at bridging the enormous gap between the efforts that have been pledged and the noble objectives that are sought, including those established at copenhagen, namely, mobilizing $100 billion by 2024 for the poorest countries. the question of united nations reform, and specifically that of the security council, remains a major concern for africa, which, because of a historical injustice, remains marginalized in this organ. it is unfortunate that such reform, which the african union has called for at every one of its summits for years, does not seem to prompt any interest. nonetheless, africa will continue to call for the creation of a more just and equitable universal organization, while reaffirming its position on this matter as expressed in the ezulwini consensus. confidence and hope in the global solutions that the united nations inspires will be well founded only if all nations, in their diversity, take part in their design and implementation. all of us, as in a marriage, must be faithful to humankind, for better and for worse.",Chad,Africa,22.3115501403809,2.388475862299465,2062.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.48496605237633367
LBR,72,2017,"the seventy-second regular session of the general assembly is being convened at a time of historic transition in liberia and during a period of acute challenges to the global order. today we face the threat of climate change, the violence of terrorism, the risks and indignaty of migration and a nuclear escalation on the korean peninsula. moreover, there is a race against time to accommodate a restless, youthful population in search of opportunity and a brighter future. i would like to congratulate the secretary-general on his election. his progressive and creative leadership assures us of his commitment and his action to reform the united nations for increased efficiency, better coordination and gender parity by 2021 at the senior leadership level. my delegation is also pleased with the initial steps taken towards the implementation of the sustainable development goals. i also wish to congratulate mr. miroslav lajcak on his election as president of the general assembly at its seventy-second session. his vast experience and strong diplomatic skills assure us that he will steer the affairs of this session in an effective manner. the liberian delegation offers him its full cooperation and support. i would also like to recognize mr. peter thompson of fiji for his stewardship over the past year, which saw the launch of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the successful conduct of the first ocean conference. our theme this year is focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet, which aptly captures a universal aspiration. i hope that, at the conclusion of our deliberations, we will forge a consensus and renew our commitment as leaders to transform the lives of our peoples and meet our responsibilities to our planet. the work of the united nations has never been more important to the search for peace and sustenance for global stability than it is today. by its charter and its purposes, the united nations continues to represent the genius of our collective ability to live together in peace and harmony. it still offers great hope to a troubled world. liberians bear witness to this truth and remain grateful to the united nations, and all of its organs and agencies, for the critical security interventions and continued support for liberias recovery and democratic aspirations. eleven years ago, in september 2006, i stood before the assembly (see a/61/pv.11) as the newly elected president of the republic of liberia and the first woman to be democratically elected as a head of state on the african continent. when i speak to women in africa and across the world, i am humbled by the inspiration drawn from my experience. the next generation must belong to women. today i address the assembly for the last time as i bring my two terms of elected office to a close. liberia is just 22 days away from historic legislative and presidential elections. it will mark the first time in 73 years that political power will be handed over peacefully and democratically from one elected leader to another. that will pave the way for the next generation of liberians to lead the country into the future. the election will signal the irreversible course that liberia has embarked upon to consolidate its young, post-conflict democracy. democracy is on the march in liberia and, i believe, on an irreversible path forward on the african continent. i thank all our partners who have made meaningful contributions financial and in kind to ensure peaceful elections, and those organizations that will deploy observer missions to attest to the integrity of the election process. i assumed office after 25 years of development reversal, which was further compounded by a 15-year civil war. we have made great progress and laid the foundation for the next democratic government. we have reshaped the armed forces of liberia and the liberia national police and have professionalized our customs and immigration services and the small liberian coast guard. we are proud to report that, since the formal turnover of security responsibilities to our government, liberia has remained stable, peaceful and secure. we transformed the economy from a growth rate of less than zero to more than 8.7 per cent in 2013, until the health crisis and plummeting commodity prices brought a downturn to our economic recovery. liberia has adjusted. we are resilient, and we embrace diversification. our focus today is on strengthening the agriculture sector for value-addition and infrastructure development, with emphasis on roads and energy industrialization. previously dysfunctional public institutions now have the capacity to respond to the needs of our citizens through decentralized county service centres, with ownership by strong local governments. and from the tragedy of the health crisis, we are strengthening our health-care systems, prioritizing prevention and delivering capacity at the community level. the impact is being felt. life expectancy progressed from a low 47 years to a hopeful 62 years, with a reduction in maternal deaths from 1,400 to 1,100 an annual rate of reduction of 3.4 per cent. the poverty rate has decreased from 63.8 per cent in 2007 to 50.9 per cent in 2016. infrastructure has been repaired and restored, and we continue to rehabilitate damaged roads and construct new ones. cities and towns are bustling with new life, thanks to the increasing provision of electricity, potable water and technology. it is now possible to receive voice and data on phones and mobile devices from virtually everywhere in the country, at competitively low prices. liberia has enjoyed the benefit of multilateralism through the full support provided by the united nations, the african union and the economic community of west african states (ecowas). from being a pariah state, liberia has gradually regained the confidence of nations and has even risen to assume leadership roles in regional bodies specifically of ecowas and the mano river union. i was personally privileged to play a role in the formulation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development as co-chair of former secretary-general ban ki-moons high-level panel on the post-2015 development agenda and to help frame the african common position as chair of the african union high- level committee. there is so much more to share about liberias post-conflict transformation how we have empowered ordinary citizens and a shared sense of citizenship, giving women, including market and rural women, a voice and the right to be heard. we have continued to transform the health-care and education systems, engender the entrepreneurial spirit in our youth, our vibrant media and our civil society. we are establishing cross-border development corridors to enhance regional trade, and we are strengthening the rule of law to tackle systemic undermining of integrity. liberia is experiencing the birth of a post-conflict artistic community in song, hip-hop, painting, poetry, storytelling and fashion. liberia has come a long way. we could not have accomplished all of that without the organization its political leadership, the generosity of its economic development support, humanitarian contributions and, most important, the stabilization and security provided to our country through the united nations mission in liberia. i applaud you, mr. president, and your predecessors, the member states and united nations civil servants around the world who have sacrificed in order for us to see the very first generation of school-age children growing up in an environment of peace, free of the violence of civil conflict. liberias transformation was powered by a world community that made a shared commitment to deliver peace to a country and a subregion beset by civil conflict and cross-border destabilization. the united nations and its partner nations were of one mind, and from that global unity a new democratic liberian state was born. liberia is a post-conflict success story. it is the organizations post-conflict success story. as i bid farewell to the assembly today, and to my fellow heads of state, i have a few parting thoughts. first, remember liberia, which is making vibrant efforts to apply the tenets of democracy. consider the lives saved, the wealth created, the stability assured because this global body led at a time of great uncertainty in our subregion and around the world. i ask the states members of the united nations to continue to lead, to spread the values of democracy, human rights and good governance, while strengthening solidarity for economic transformation and social resilience. it is often in times of transition that great leaders emerge and institutions are strengthened. secondly, i recall that two years ago, at its seventieth session, the assembly adopted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which includes 17 goals that encapsulate the aspirations of member states to eradicate poverty and reduce, if not eliminate, inequalities within and between countries. our commitment to achieving the goals must be unwavering, because progress in that area is inextricably linked to ending conflict and sustaining peace. thirdly, real progress remains elusive in the lingering effort to reform the security council and make it more responsive to current global realities. the call for that reform must be pursued more robustly towards an early conclusion. africas views are well articulated in the ezulwini consensus. today african nations are participating in strong regional and subregional bodies, which are evolving adopting measures to secure and preserve peace and security, while strengthening economic integration. the united nations, as the pre-eminent world body, must also continue to evolve to more effectively serve the common interests of all member states. it must continue to chart the way forward. in its capable hands rest the hope and aspirations for a more just, peaceful and humane world, for the sake of our people and our planet.",Liberia,Africa,48.3013610839844,2.246325027080235,1594.0,6.0,0.0,6.0,3.764115432873275
SEN,72,2017,"the senegalese delegation would like to thank the president of the general assembly at its previous session and to wish the current president every success in guiding the work of our session. i would also like to reiterate our congratulations and support to secretary-general antonio guterres for the success of his mission at the head of the organization. the theme of the seventy-second session commits us to focusing on people for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet. unfortunately, in these times of turbulence and uncertainty, the ideal of a better world for all comes up against the crises of a world of conflict that is also in conflict with itself. on the security and humanitarian fronts, millions of individuals continue to suffer every day from the ravages of war, terrorism and violence in all their forms. with regard to food crises, according to the food and agriculture organization, more than 1 billion tons of food are wasted each year, while more than 795 million people go hungry every day. where the environment is concerned, global warming has reached an unprecedented level, while agreed-on commitments to addressing the related crises, including adequate green climate fund financing, have been slow to materialize. with regard to our ethical and moral crises, we see the universal mission of democracy and human rights proclaimed at the same time that it turns in on itself and lets extremist, racist and xenophobic tendencies re-emerge. these dangerous excesses, born out of the absurd claim that one race, civilization or culture is superior to others, have inspired the worst tragedies of history, including slavery, colonization, the holocaust and apartheid. if we yield to these abuses, we renounce the founding values of the united nations. we forget that the true challenges of our time lie elsewhere, such as in the fight against the threat of terrorism. senegal, i emphasize, vigorously condemns terrorism wherever it may strike. nothing, and certainly not religion, can justify violent fanaticism. at the same time, we cannot accept the equation of islam with violence. we cannot accept that muslims are held accountable for violence of which they themselves are victims. we are all concerned about the terrorist threat. we therefore have a responsibility to work together to find agreed solutions to this scourge. that is the purpose of the dakar international forum on peace and security in africa, whose fourth meeting will be held on 13 and 14 november. among other topics, the forum will focus on the doctrinal response of islam vis-a-vis violent extremism. we wish to see an africa of peace and security, a place that does not serve as a haven for terrorist groups that are fought and defeated elsewhere. that is why senegal remains engaged in seven peacekeeping operations, including the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali, and welcomes the efforts of the group of five for the sahel and its partner states in the fight against terrorism. i would like to reiterate our support for the national peace and reconciliation process under way in our sister republic of mali, a process that is taking place with respect for the countrys territorial integrity and in accordance with security council resolution 2374 (2017). in the middle east, senegal reiterates the right of the palestinian people to a viable state, living side by side in peace with the state of israel, each within secure and internationally recognized borders. in burma, we are seriously concerned about the abuses of the muslim rohingya population. we therefore cannot allow outrage to be a selective emotion, and senegal urges the international community to take action to put an end to this genuine human tragedy. in a world of interaction and interdependence, peace today, more so than in the past, is not merely the absence of war. it is also the preservation of the planets resources, the scarcity of which increases the risk of internal crises and of international conflicts. it is vital to safeguard the integrity of the paris agreement on climate change. the future of the planet is at stake. peace also requires fairer international trade that paves the way for progress and prosperity for all. the world cannot be at peace with itself as long as there endures a system of unequal exchanges in which the haves continue to earn more and the have-nots to have even less. we must work for mutually beneficial exchanges that protect investment, pay fairly for raw materials and generate shared prosperity. that is the best way to overcome poverty, to support africas efforts to emerge and to curb illegal migratory movements. as the current chair of the new partnership for africas development, i welcome the compact with africa initiative, launched by germany within the framework of the group of 20, to stimulate investment on the african continent. as part of this new momentum of support for development through partnership, senegal looks forward to hosting three major events on the international communitys agenda. they are the third africa investment forum, from 25 to 27 september, in cooperation with china and the world bank; the international conference on quality infrastructure in january 2018, at the initiative of japan; and, on 8 february 2018, the replenishment conference for the global partnership for education fund, amounting to $3.1 billion over three years. by mobilizing these resources, we will give millions of children the opportunity to go to school and achieve their dreams of a fulfilled life. i thank france for sponsoring the conference, together with senegal, and we invite all partner and beneficiary states to attend. the president took the chair. the positive changes we seek to promote in the worlds affairs will succeed only in the context of an inclusive and equitable momentum that reconciles all of our interests. to that end, the time has come to afford africa the place it deserves on the security council, as called for in the ezulwini consensus. it is time to reform the rules of global economic and financial governance, including by combating tax evasion more effectively to help mobilize domestic resources for development financing. it is time to stop seeing africa as a continent of the future, content with random and uncertain promises that others design, write and interpret on its behalf. africa wishes to be a stakeholder in a present that takes its interests and its need to emerge into account through renewed and mutually beneficial partnerships. it is in that spirit that senegal will continue to work with all friendly countries and partners after its mandate on the security council ends, in a few months time. despite the uncertainties and difficulties of our times, we must continue to have faith in multilateralism. preceding generations had the wisdom to understand that isolationism and belligerency are a dead end. out of the ruins of war, they built the foundations of peace; but it is a peace that is always a work in progress. whenever its foundations falter, all humankind is threatened. the wisdom of our predecessors demands that we work together to safeguard peace, in the name of our shared humanity, which brings us together and assigns us a shared destiny.",Senegal,Africa,51.9004211425781,4.740079879760742,1193.0,6.0,0.0,6.0,5.029337803855825
ZAF,72,2017,"i take this opportunity to express south africas solidarity with the fraternal governments and the peoples of the caribbean following waves of devastating hurricanes that have resulted in loss of life, injuries and serious damage to infrastructure and property. our thoughts are also with the government and the people of mexico in the wake of the earthquake that rocked mexico city yesterday. i wish to congratulate you, mr. president, on your election to the presidency of the general assembly at its seventy-second session. i assure you of south africas full support in the implementation of your priorities and responsibilities throughout your term. we also commend mr. peter thompson of fiji for his exceptional leadership during the assemblys seventy- first session. i warmly congratulate mr. antonio guterres on his appointment as the secretary- general. we also congratulatemr. ban ki-moon on his successsful tenure. we have chosen an appropriate theme for this debate, given the challenges facing the world today focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet. the theme encompasses the three pillars of the united nations: peace and security, humanitarian affairs and human rights, and socioeconomic and sustainable development. the adoption of the sustainable development goals (sdgs), two years ago, in order to continue the unfinished business of the millennium development goals marked a significant shift and historic moment in the life of the united nations. we all committed ourselves to addressing the challenges of poverty, underdevelopment and inequality. however, a lot more still needs to be done to promote a more equal and just socioeconomic world order so that we can achieve the sdgs. the current structure of the global economy continues to deepen the divide between the global north and global south.while a few enjoy the benefits of globalization, the majority of the peoples of the world still live in abject poverty and hunger, with no hope of ever improving their living conditions. even within developed countries, the gap between rich and poor remains wide and is of serious concern. we need political will and commitment from global leaders to address the challenges and obstacles posed by the untransformed structure of the global economy, if we hope to achieve the goals and ambitions of 2030 agenda for sustainable development. those unequal and unjust economic power relations manifest themselves sharply in africa. for example, our continent is endowed with mineral resources, but it still has the highest number of least developed countries. many developed countries continue to fuel their development from the resources of the african continent. the continent also continues to lose a significant portion of its resources through illicit financial outflows. africa loses billions of dollars that it otherwise would utilize to develop the continent and to provide for education, health care, housing and other critical basic needs for the african populations. money laundering, tax evasion and tax avoidance, corruption and transfer pricing by multinational companies are some of the biggest challenges to economic growth and stability. they undermine the integrity of the global financial system, efficient tax collection and equitable allocation of resources. we appeal for the cooperation and commitment of every state member of the united nations and the international community at large to address that phenomenon. developed countries in particular have a historical and moral obligation to contribute to achieving a fair global economic environment and to eradicate the scourge of illicit financial flows from the continent. the united nations should also play a central role in addressing this problem. we therefore welcome the adoption by the general assembly of resolution 71/213, entitled promotion on international cooperation to combat illicit financial flows in order to foster sustainable development. it is a preliminary step towards a global architecture to tackle the scourge and impacts of illicit financial flows. the issue of global peace and security continues to be one of the pillars of the united nations agenda. south africa reaffirms its commitment to cooperation between the united nations and regional and subregional organizations, particularly the african union (au), in matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security. we welcome the continued support for the aus efforts to resolve conflicts on the african continent through promoting african solutions to african problems and challenges. as africans, we are doing everything possible to reach our goal of silencing the guns by 2020, as set out in our agenda 2063, a continental blueprint for a peaceful, prosperous and democratic africa. in that regard, we continue to make significant progress in resolving challenges to peace and security in our continent. we hope that soon the sister people of libya will be able to live in peace and harmony in a united and democratic country. in 2011, the african union called for dialogue to resolve the crisis in libya. unfortunately, some of us present here opted for guns and bombs, and today those countries are making little effort to promote stability in libya. the major focus and preoccupation has become how to deal with the flow of migrants arriving in europe from our continent and the middle east, which is a mere symptom. the war in libya has contributed a great deal to the destabilization of the sahel region all the way to central africa, creating a corridor for illicit arms trafficking and terrorist activities. in fact, had our warning been heeded that the supply of arms to civilians in libya and the arming of civilians in syria would cause loss of life, great instability and mayhem, the world would be more peaceful today. south africa continues to call for an immediate end to the violence and for a syrian-led political transition and a negotiated settlement that reflects the will of the syrian people. in both instances of libya and syria we strongly cautioned against seeking to resolve internal challenges of sovereign states by imposing foreign solutions through military means. it is hoped that lessons will be learned from those tragic episodes in order to make the world a more peaceful place. we continue our call for calm on the korean peninsula. the situation cannot be allowed to get out of hand. as a country that voluntarily dismantled its nuclear-weapon programme, south africa is of the firm view that there are no safe hands for weapons of mass destruction. the only viable solution to the problems of nuclear weapons is their total elimination, as expressed in the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, recently adopted by the united nations conference to negotiate a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination. it can no longer be acceptable that a few countries maintain arsenals and stockpiles of nuclear weapons as part of their strategic defence and security doctrine, while expecting others to remain at their mercy. we are concerned that any possible accidental detonation would lead to a disaster of epic proportions. we are making a clarion call to all states members of the united nations to sign and ratify the nuclear- weapon-ban treaty in order to rid the world and humankind of these lethal weapons of mass destruction. at the same time, we reaffirm the inalienable right of states to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, as reinforced in the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. south africa is today proud to be the biggest producer of medical isotopes used in the treatment of cancer patients globally. we will continue to harness the peaceful uses of atoms in addressing challenges of socioeconomic development. as we stand here, the security council is paralysed and unable to carry out its charter responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security. we remain steadfast in our call for the reform of that critical organ of the united nations. we hope that the secretary-general, working with the entire membership, can provide some impetus towards fulfilling this long- awaited ideal. failure to do so will result in the united nations irreversibly losing its legitimacy. we take this opportunity to express our empathy and solidarity with all the victims of the devastating hurricanes, monsoons, floods and droughts as a result of climate change. those phenomena are proof that climate change is real and that, if we do not act now, future generations will suffer untold consequences. the paris agreement on climate change is a milestone in the history of efforts to address climate change and all its consequences. we should resist all efforts to unravel and undermine the paris agreement. our efforts should be directed at the mobilization of the resources required for its implementation. for south africa, the seventy-second session of the general assembly coincides with the centenary of oliver reginald tambo, who led our liberation movement, the african national congress, for three decades in the struggle against apartheid and racism in south africa. o.r. tambo travelled all over the continent of africa and the globe, mobilizing international support for the struggle against racial discrimination and the oppressive apartheid regime. he strongly believed in the role of multilateralism and in the centrality of the united nations. it was for that reason that he spent a lot of time in the rooms and corridors of this united nations building, mobilizing members to take firm action against the apartheid regime in south africa. as we celebrate what would have been o.r. tambos one-hundredth birthday, we take this opportunity as a country once again to thank the united nations and the international community for their support for and solidarity with our struggle for liberation. if o.r. tambo were still alive today, he would have pleaded with the organization to do all it can to support the struggle of the palestinian people against occupation and to support the struggle of the people of western sahara. the world has preached a two-state solution for the situation in palestine, yet we have seen the expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied palestinian territory. we appeal to the general assembly that the same resolve shown in supporting the south african struggle for liberation should be shown towards ending the apartheid practices against the people of palestine. we also wish to remind the general assembly that the right of the people of western sahara to self- determination continues to be undermined, challenged and denied. the united nations must remain seized with that issue, for the benefit of the people of western sahara and the african aspirations for integration and peaceful coexistence. i also wish to register south africas disappointment at the decision of the united states administration in june to reverse the progress that was made in the past two years towards ending the cuban blockade. south africa stands ready to work with the united nations to promote peace, human rights and sustainable development. as said by our liberation icon oliver reginald tambo, we seek to live in peace with our neighbours and the peoples of the world in conditions of equality, mutual respect and equal advantage.",South Africa,Africa,87.0466690063477,5.59867000579834,1819.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
MOZ,72,2017,"i have the honour to address the seventy-second session of the general assembly on behalf of his excellency mr. filipe jacinto nyusi, president of the republic of mozambique, who could not attend this gathering owing to other commitments at home. allow me therefore to start by conveying president nyusis good wishes for a successful session of the assembly, which is the highest forum for global political and diplomatic dialogue. i would like to take this opportunity to join the speakers who preceded me in congratulating you, sir, on your unanimous election to preside over the general assembly at its seventy-second session. i assure you of the full commitment of mozambique to contributing to the realization of the goals we have all envisaged to achieve during this important session. we trust that your gifted leadership and diplomatic experience will add value to our endeavours and contribute to the success of the work of this session. i wish equally to congratulate your predecessor, his excellency mr. peter thomson of fiji, for his stewardship and commitment to fulfilling the agenda at the last session of the general assembly. a special word of appreciation goes to his excellency mr. antonio guterres, the secretary- general, for the vision and leadership he has displayed in this, his first year in office. we believe that he is steering the organization onto the right path in order to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness as it serves us, the member states, in our quest to deliver on the ambitious goals we have set for our peoples. only a strong and vibrant united nations system can ensure that the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and its goals will deliver societies that are more inclusive, peaceful and prosperous than ever, without compromising the very existence of our planet. two years after we pledged our commitment to the sustainable development goals, the world remains confronted with multiple and complex challenges that threaten to constrain the gains we made in fostering global peace and stability, stall and reverse the advances made in fostering social and economic wellbeing of our peoples, and cause irreversible damage to our planet. we therefore welcome the theme chosen for this session by the president of the general assembly, namely, focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet, as it allows this body to reflect in a timely manner on how best to address the challenges before us. this reflection in a multilateral forum such as the general assembly is essential if we are to coordinate and consolidate our approaches as we strive individually and collectively to deliver on the 2030 agenda. the renewed focus on people should serve as a universal impetus for all the development actors to translate into practice actions that promote peace and the well-being of all humankind. it is worth recalling that our resolve is to make the 2030 agenda for sustainable development a framework that brings together the collective will to transform peoples lives in a sustainable way by lifting them from poverty and promoting human dignity without neglecting peace, which is a critical factor in the attainment of sustainable development, based on the interplay of the economic, social and environmental pillars. as we strive to accomplish these goals, we are challenged to find the ways and means to honour the commitments undertaken in the addis ababa action agenda, the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction and the paris agreement on climate change. only joint and complementary efforts in those three domains will enable us to build the necessary resilience at the national, regional and international levels commensurate with the challenges before us and in line with our aspiration of leaving no country behind. the challenges we faced and the experiences we gained in the implementation of other globally agreed development goals in the past underline the need for greater commitment from our development partners to scale up and honour their assistance and for funding pledges made to support climate resilience, mitigation and adaptation, as well as disaster-prevention efforts in developing countries. this support is of paramount importance to mitigating the effects of climate variability, whose devastating effects have been laid bare in the last two months in several states members of this body.furthermore, it is also clear that a robust and efficient united nations system, together with a strong partnership between the organization and the regional bodies, can play a catalytic role in accelerating national development and strengthening democratic political systems and institutions that can lead to more inclusive and peaceful societies. in that vein, we support the ongoing efforts undertaken by the secretary-general to reform and reposition the united nations development system with a view to making it more responsive to the development needs of its members. the overwhelming challenges of our times require bold and determined political will to achieve the results we seek. mozambique reaffirms its unequivocal commitment to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, since focusing on people has always been at the core of mozambiques national development agenda. accordingly, we have aligned our national development agenda to include the three dimensions of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which are now reflected in the five pillars of our national five-year plan, namely, consolidating national unity, peace and sovereignty; developing human and social capital; promoting employment, productivity and competitiveness; developing economic and social infrastructures; and ensuring sustainable and transparent management of natural resources and the environment. mozambique has created a multi-stakeholder national reference group that encompasses government, civil society, the private sector and international cooperation partners for the management of the sustainable development goals and is promoting capacity-building for its implementation, monitoring and evaluation. in the effort to consolidate national unity, peace and sovereignty, our focus on people leads us to strive to ensure that lasting peace and stability is a reality to all mozambicans. durable peace and stability therefore ranks as an overarching priority in our national agenda, as it is a crucial factor for the development and promotion of lasting human security in the broadest sense. accordingly, the government of mozambique, under the leadership of president filipe jacinto nyusi, is striving for an inclusive dialogue with all political actors and civil society through both formal and informal mechanisms, including the parliament. this inclusive approach is also used to engage mozambicans in the conceptualization and implementation of the national development agenda. furthermore, our focus on people envisages not leaving anyone behind, which is one of the guiding precepts of our universal agenda. therefore, particular attention is given to policies and strategies aimed at the protection and the full enjoyment of human rights, the promotion of gender equality and equity as well as the empowerment of women and youth, who constitute the majority of our people. mozambique believes that our focus on people, peace, a decent life and a sustainable planet also requires a regional dimension, particularly in the context of a globalized world. we are therefore encouraged by the contributions that regional and international multilateral mechanisms have made to prevent and manage conflicts and to promote peace and stability, in particular those under the southern african development community, the african union and the community of portuguese-speaking countries, to which we are proud to belong. we believe that mechanisms that promote peace and prosperity should also constitute a strong platform of action aimed at fostering dialogue among civilizations, an unquestionable tool in the promotion of a culture of tolerance, peaceful coexistence and a sustainable world. we pledge to continue to play our role in these endeavours. our resolve to focus on people entails that we address with a sense of urgency the root causes of the increase in unregulated migration and the massive flows of refugees, two dimensions of the human crises that we are confronted with in modern times. this regrettable reality is in great part a consequence of a succession of unresolved crises or poorly settled conflict situations in relation to which the international community bears a responsibility. in that connection, we risk achieving an ineffective and fragile peace if the international community remains focused on short-term and ad hoc measures that leave scope for the recurrence of the same intractable problems at a later stage. the international community should come together to redouble efforts and to build consensus to prevent the senseless loss of lives. we need to adopt measures to reduce peoples vulnerabilities, complemented by actions that address the complex and structural causes of these mass movements, such as conflicts and political, social and economic exclusion. a focus on people on a sustainable planet also requires urgent attention to climate change. today more than ever before, the challenges posed by the adverse impact of climate change are noticeable. everyday we are confronted by the destructive impact of climate change, challenging those who continue to harbour doubts about the effects of human activities on the environment and on the climate. the recent devastating effects of the hurricanes, the mudslides and the earthquake that affected millions of people in the caribbean region, the united states of america, sierra leone and mexico are vivid reminders of the scale of the natural disaster threats we face. i would like to seize this opportunity to convey to the affected people and countries a message of solidarity and sympathy on behalf of the people and the government of mozambique. the great human losses and the destruction of infrastructure as a result of the scale and ferocity of these storms prove once again that, beyond our convictions, we need to reflect and to act as a common front to face the menaces arising from climatic change. to that end, we reaffirm the importance of the paris agreement on climate change as an instrument to strengthen the much-needed partnerships for adaptation and mitigation measures. the positive dynamics generated by the major development commitments made by the international community in 2015 have been overshadowed by the worrying signs of the eruption of political instability, the prevailing inter- and intra-state conflicts, particularly in africa and the middle east, the rising tensions in the korean peninsula, as well as by the recurrence of acts of terrorism and of violent extremism. these challenges to peace and stability threaten to reverse the development gains registered over the recent decades and to hinder our development efforts as we chart the way forward. therefore, it is our hope that the ongoing peace initiatives as well as the measures to curb the recruitment and finance of terrorist groups will result in opportunities to further promote peace and development, as well as to strengthen human rights and to build more inclusive societies. only through constructive dialogue and peaceful means and solutions can we secure durable peace and stability in our world. to that end, we would like to emphasize the importance of strong democratic institutions at the national level, the impact of regional cooperation and the role of the united nations. as we gather in this great hall, the world is once again facing the threat of the dangers posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons, which have become the most dangerous existential threat that humankind faces in the twenty-first century. as a country with a constitution that values the principle of the universal disarmament of all states and negotiated solutions to international conflicts, as well as the peaceful use of nuclear energy, mozambique notes with great concern the escalation of tension and the risk of nuclear confrontation that is unfolding on the korean peninsula. the catastrophic impact of a nuclear conflict demands a more restrained approach based on dialogue, skilful diplomacy and the political will to de-escalate and to fully comply with the relevant security council resolutions. more than anything else, the resolutions signal our collective disapproval of the course of events in that part of the world. the lack of progress in the decolonization of western sahara, the sole african country still to exercise the right to self-determination, continues to be a cause for grave concern to mozambique. regrettably, all the efforts deployed by the united nations, the african union and other actors to bring about an accepted settlement aiming to grant the people of western sahara their inalienable right to self-determination and independence has not yielded results. we would like to seize this opportunity to call upon the security council, the general assembly and the international community to exercise their responsibility by implementing their own resolutions, particularly regarding the principle of self-determination and right of freedom, as well as to support the african union and its special envoy to western sahara, mr. joaquim chissano, former president of mozambique. the principle of self-determination and the right to freedom should also be a reality for the palestinian people. to that end, it is imperative that the relevant security council resolutions be implemented. we believe that the solution relies on the two-state principle of palestine and israel coexisting side by side, in peace and security. mozambique has followed with great interest the efforts of cuba and the united states of america to stabilize the diplomatic relations between these two neighbouring countries, an important step towards the normalization of bilateral relations and bringing to an end the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the united states of americaagainst cuba. in that context, we note with concern the latest developments and appeal to the united states of america to put an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo, for it hinders the socioeconomic development of cuba and the cuban people. therefore, mozambique once again associates itself with the overwhelming majority of countries in this hall to demand the immediate termination of this unilateral coercive measure. we live in a world confronted by challenges that demand global responses. the relevance of the united nations, the lodestar of multilateralism, over the past 72 years of its existence has always rested in its ability to reform and reinvent itself to respond more suitably to the challenges of the continuously changing world that it serves. therefore, mozambique supports the secretary-generals efforts to pursue reform of the united nations system in order to make it fit for purpose, and commends his demonstrated desire to fully consult and seek consent of the united nations membership at each stage of the process. in addition to the ongoing reforms, we also need to urgently accelerate security council reform, another element that will contribute to reaffirming the role of the united nations in the quest for sustainable solutions to the peace and security challenges facing humankind. the difficulties stemming from the lack of consensus among members to initiate text-based negotiations to complete the reform of the security council constrain our ability to open a new window of opportunity that would enhance the credibility of the organ by making it more representative of the current reality. the security council is one of the fundamental pillars of the success of the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. i would like to conclude by reiterating the unconditional commitment of the government of mozambique to continuing to engage, in partnership with the united nations and fellow member states, in the search of sustainable solutions to the problems that affect the humanity. history has shown us that humankind thrives best when we, the peoples, are able to share, collaborate, cooperate, engage in dialogue and care. the general assembly will always be the platform where we renew our commitment and rededicate ourselves to the noble ideals on which this great organization was founded to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. let us all stay loyal to these lofty ideals enshrined in the charter of the united nations and work together to transform our world.",Mozambique,Africa,60.6554298400879,5.486649990081787,2623.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.3812428516965307
BDI,72,2017,"i have the pleasure of conveying to the assembly the most fraternal greetings of mr. pierre nkurunziza, president of the republic of burundi. he would have liked to be present here, but pressing commitments back home prevented him from making the journey to new york. my delegation wishes to congratulate mr. miroslav lajcak on his outstanding election as president of the general assembly at its seventy-second session. i take this opportunity to pay a vibrant tribute to his predecessor, mr. peter thomson, a worthy son of fiji, for a job well done. as this is his first session of the general assembly as head of our organization, may i also express burundis appreciation to secretary-general antonio guterres for his commitment to the values of peace, security and development. patience is a virtue that climate change does not recognize. the devastating effects it has fuelled have permeated virtually all conversations in this venue and ushered in this very session. the names of irma and maria, in the meteorological field at least, will forever connote total destruction. i therefore extend our most sincere condolences to the countries and regions of the caribbean that have been severely affected by these hurricanes. we also express burundis solidarity with mexico, stricken this week by an earthquake. we stand wholeheartedly with all these countries and their peoples. the climatic disturbances of recent times are again sounding the alarm, urging all states to assume their collective duty to combat global warming and to implement without delay the commitments of the paris agreement on climate change. we believe that no state may shirk its responsibility to that end, whatever its size, shape or place on the map of the world. we must work together, for we are all in the same boat. if we wish to attain the objective of containing the average temperature rise on the planet below 2c compared to pre-industrial levels and pursue measures to limit temperature increases to 1.5c vis-a-vis pre-industrial levels, we need to act today because tomorrow will be too late. in implementing the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, burundi is continuing its path of social inclusion and shared economic growth. it cannot do otherwise, since these two aspects are key pillars of the development policy advocated through vision 2025. to that end, our country counts on the cooperation of friendly states and other international partners. unfortunately, the sanctions adopted by the european union against burundi are not contributing to the realization of these plans of great importance for the burundian people, because they deprive the country of necessary resources. thus, the attainment of the 2030 agenda and the objectives of the african union agenda 2063 is compromised as a result of these sanctions. we also believe that sanctions unilaterally imposed against developing states in general, and in africa in particular, should be banned from the international system, since they perpetuate historical injustices and violate the sacrosanct principle of equal sovereignty. like the african union, burundi therefore rejects and condemns the sanctions imposed on burundi and other african countries. in the field of migration, we must work together to find solutions to the root causes of population movements, made up mostly of young people, from countries of the south to the north. we need to ensure conditions of humane migration in order to protect migrants, who contribute to the well-being of the host communities through their multifaceted contributions to economic activity. the apocalyptic scenes in the mediterranean sea strike at our consciences as human beings. the reasons for migration must be explained and we must all understand them if we are to find appropriate solutions. it is regrettable that migration is increasingly being met with a resurgence of racism, rejection of the other and, often, even acts of rare violence against migrants. likewise, racist populism is becoming increasingly prominent and gradually undermining the paradigms on which certain so-called advanced societies have long rested. migration is sometimes the result of trafficking in human beings. the victims are doubly affected, since in addition to being wrenched from their countries of origin, they are mistreated in the host countries. that is unacceptable. consequently, we advocate strengthened international cooperation in that area so as to build a more just world. at the political level, our country reiterates, as it has done repeatedly, its position in consonance with the charter of the united nations. all states members of the united nations are sovereign powers, and their sovereignty is equal. we call for reining in those states that continue in the twenty-first century to believe that they have the right to intervene in the internal affairs of other states, especially developing countries. we thank the security council, which, in the case of burundi, has reaffirmed respect for its sovereignty in its various resolutions and presidential statements. we can never say it enough burundi believes that non-interference in the internal affairs of other states and respect for their territorial integrity and sovereignty constitute the pillars of a balanced international system under the charter of the united nations. those principles are not negotiable. today more than ever, burundi stands ready to defend them at any price. recently, human rights have become another tool of domination. as a universal concept broadly elaborated upon in the universal declaration of human rights and other relevant international instruments, human rights have been increasingly exploited by several states that, if not mindful of their actions, will divert the human rights council from the goals entrusted to it by the general assembly. some members have become accustomed to obtaining, through the human rights council and other mechanisms established by the latter, resolutions aimed at undermining the peace and security of the states that they wish to harm. the recent report of the international commission of inquiry on burundi (a/hrc/36/54) constitutes the ultimate proof of the councils manipulation by certain small groups. burundi reiterates that it is ready to cooperate with the relevant united nations bodies, but on the condition that such cooperation be based on clear, fair and predictable foundations that, above all, respect the choices made by the burundians themselves in the areas of governance and development. with regard to the inter-burundian dialogue and the external component, only a short time ago the government of the republic of burundi received a visit from the facilitation team to follow up on consultations and resume discussions. burundis positions were made known to the facilitation team. we are waiting for the facilitation to call for the next meeting, at which the delegations will have their voices heard. burundi has asked its refugees to return. our appeal, which we reiterate here and now, has also been made to neighbouring countries so as to facilitate their repatriation. today, the repatriation movement continues apace, with the arrival of approximately 1,700 citizens who found refuge in tanzania and 3,000 returning from rwanda. they are joining tens of thousands of others who have returned over the past several months, as well as those who would like to return. we thank the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees and the international organization for migration for their cooperation in facilitating those return movements. we take this opportunity to ask that unscrupulous human rights council officials end the unsavoury practice of encouraging refugees not to return. at the same time, we call on the united nations to continue to monitor the situation of burundian refugees in the eastern part of the democratic republic of the congo and neighbouring countries, in full compliance with the relevant provisions of the geneva conventions. we deplore the shooting that took place a week ago in kamanyola, in the democratic republic of the congo, resulting in the deaths of 38 burundian refugees, at least one officer of the forces armees de la republique democratique du congo, and more than 120 wounded. once again, we invite the refugees to return home. burundi has joined other states in combating terrorism, with 5,400 troops in somalia within the framework of the african union mission in somalia (amisom). burundi has been the second-largest troop-contributing country in somalia for the past 10 years. burundi is concerned about the continued reduction in support for amisom, especially at a time when an important campaign has been planned. the successes of the past several years cannot be sacrificed to self-interest. that would run contrary to the oath taken by all partners, which have repeatedly stated that terrorism is a global threat. in pursuing its contribution to world peace and security, burundi participates in peacekeeping operations in the brotherly country of the central african republic, and its police units are deployed in cote divoire and haiti. burundi believes that the efforts and sacrifices made by others must be rightly acknowledged in all cases. if there is one recurring topic of debate in this hall, it is that of the reform of the united nations, and in particular the security council. burundi supports all approaches aimed at fostering a constructive interaction, open to all, between the states members of our organization, on the one hand, and the secretary- general on the other. burundi supports the structural reform of the united nations pursuant to the initiative taken at the high-level event on 18 september. it is necessary to consider the necessary reforms with the goal of improving the functioning of organs including the security council and the general assembly. that will bring the bodies concerned in line with the realities of the twenty-first century. it is clear that by dint of pouring new wine into old wineskins, we wind up bursting the latter. we must be firm in our conviction that, 72 years after its establishment, the united nations is in need of a complete face-lift. concerning reform of the security council in particular, burundi supports the shared african stance known as the ezulwini consensus. it is high time that we correct the injustices of the past and allow the equitable participation of all continents in the governance of international peace and security. with regard to international issues, burundi welcomes the return of the kingdom of morocco to the fold of the african union so that we can build a strong and prosperous continent together. with regard to western sahara, burundi supports the decisions and resolutions adopted by the relevant united nations bodies. we call for the unconditional lifting of the economic blockade against cuba without delay. the cuban people have suffered under unjust measures that were adopted during the cold war era for primarily ideological reasons and can no longer be justified today. similarly, in the case of venezuela, we call on the international community to take measures that promote national cohesion and not social disruption. lastly, i wish the general assembly every success at this session.",Burundi,Africa,68.3753280639648,5.009188480379824,1789.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.6769144773616547
ETH,72,2017,"i would like to join other delegations in congratulating the president on his election to preside over the work of the general assembly at its seventy-second session, and i wish to assure him of the support and cooperation of my delegation in the discharge of his responsibilities through the course of the session. let me also take this opportunity to express appreciation to his predecessor, who effectively guided the work of the general assembly at its previous session. we welcome the appointment of mr. antonio guterres as the new secretary-general and support his call for a surge in diplomacy for peace in addressing the many crisis situations that the world is facing today. let me stress here we are behind the secretary-general in his efforts to reform the organization in the three interrelated areas of development, peace and security, and management. it has been indeed a great pleasure and honour for ethiopia to preside over the work of the security council during this important month, when world leaders gather in new york for the new session of the general assembly to discuss issues of global peace, security and development. we would like to express our gratitude to all the delegations that participated in the high-level open debate of the security council on wednesday, 20 september, on the reform of united nations peacekeeping operations (see s/pv.8051). as a leading troop-contributing country, ethiopia attaches great importance to strengthening the role of united nations peacekeeping in addressing challenges to international peace and security. in that regard, we welcome the unanimous adoption of security council resolution 2378 (2017), which we introduced on wednesday, and we thank all delegations that sponsored the resolution, which reaffirms the central role of united nations peacekeeping as one of the most effective tools available to the world in the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security. that the world is facing unprecedented challenges to its peace and prosperity has been all too apparent for quite some time now. geopolitical tensions reminiscent of the cold war are increasing. the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is posing a real threat to global peace and security. terrorism and violent extremism continue to wreak havoc across various parts of the world. global income inequality is no longer just a development challenge; it is also a security threat. climate change is not a fiction but real, and we are witnessing its devastating consequences for humankind and the planet. countries such as my own continue to face that horrendous challenge to their development. three major peace and security reviews were conducted only two years ago, providing valuable recommendations, which, if implemented, could help the united nations keep pace with the changing global security dynamics and respond effectively to new and emerging peace and security challenges in a comprehensive, systematic and coordinated manner. the clear conclusion of the three major reviews was that the primary united nations approach to resolving conflicts should be a political one. indeed, the many conflict and crisis situations around the world cannot be resolved other than through political means. that holds true not only for the crisis in south sudan, close to my country, but also for the conflicts that are raging in the middle east, including in syria and yemen, as well as the dangerous situation on the korean peninsula. it is therefore only by reaffirming our commitments to the letter and spirit of chapter vi of the charter of the united nations, on the pacific settlement of disputes, that we can effectively respond to the global peace and security challenges we are facing today. however, that is obviously easier said than done. that is because without the political will and commitment of the conflicting parties to finding a political solution through dialogue and negotiation, peace is bound to elude us. a common purpose and resolve on the part of all external actors involved in the search for a political solution to conflict and crisis situations are also absolutely vital. what current global security requires is a stronger and more effective global and regional partnership in the service of conflict prevention and peace. what we have repeatedly seen is that in the absence of that partnership, which must be underpinned by the principles of complementarity and coherence, no meaningful progress can be achieved. the united nations should be able to play a leading role in forging those kinds of partnerships and in sharing the burden in accordance with the charter. the links connecting peace, security and development have long been recognized, and that was also the other clear key message emanating from the three major peace and security reviews. more peaceful and inclusive societies generate an environment conducive to sustainable development, and sustainable peace is both an enabler and an outcome of sustainable development. the year 2015 was indeed seminal in that regard. the commitment that we made in this hall to the transformative 2030 agenda for sustainable development and to inclusiveness, leaving no one behind, was the result of our shared conviction that our fates and futures are linked and that poverty is a shared challenge. the sustainable development goals (sdgs) were further reinforced by the adoption of the paris agreement on climate change, which entered into force last november, thereby strengthening the global response to the threats posed by that phenomenon. today, however, it is no longer the time to celebrate those achievements; we need rather to reflect where we are in terms of their implementation. though the sdgs were endorsed by all with much optimism, the current state of affairs is far from reassuring. the global situation since their adoption has not been conducive to ensuring their reasonably effective implementation. that is a major disappointment for all those who have been hoping to see renewed global partnership in the spirit of the 2030 agenda. for our part, we have fully embraced and begun to record encouraging initial results in implementing the 2030 agenda. we have continued to invest in our people so as to improve their well-being. in order to achieve structural transformation and diversify our economy, the government is expanding our manufacturing sector and infrastructure facilities, which have continued to attract an increasing amount of domestic and foreign investments. in order to finance our ambitious national projects, we are mobilizing domestic resources while maximizing the positive impacts of foreign assistance. by implementing integrated, pro-poor policies, we have been reducing poverty and enhancing the quality of life, and we have sustained our rapid and inclusive economic growth. ethiopia is therefore projected to be the fastest growing economy in the world by the end of 2017. that should, of course, not be a source of complacency; it should rather drive us further to redouble our determination and endeavours to accelerate the full implementation of our current national development policy, which integrates the sdgs, and we will remain fully committed to realizing the sustainable development goals, to responding to the legitimate development demands of our people and to addressing our multifaceted development challenges. that is not easy, nor are our challenges uncomplicated, most particularly those related to natural phenomena. we in ethiopia, like many other countries, are dealing almost every day with the adverse effects of climate change. now is not the time, therefore, to doubt their devastating impact, while millions of our fellow humans are losing their lives and their hard- won development achievements. that is happening all over the world. it is high time to act urgently and decisively to combat the adverse impacts of climate change, particularly its disproportionately bad effect on the most vulnerable countries, which, as has been repeatedly pointed out, bear almost no responsibility for causing climate change. climate change, not just poverty, is our major challenge. the current climate-induced drought is affecting millions of people. for the third consecutive year, after successfully dealing with the el nino-induced drought in 2015, ethiopia is confronting the adverse effects of climate change. that is why i said earlier that climate change is real and poses a clear danger for humankind, because it undermines development gains. we are doing everything that we can to mitigate its negative effects, with the continuing and much appreciated support of our bilateral and multilateral partners. while we are committed to addressing our current humanitarian emergency, we will also continue to implement our national strategy to build a green and resilient economy. countries such as ethiopia that are fully committed to implementing the sustainable development agenda require an international environment that can help them succeed in their fight against poverty. ending poverty, achieving prosperity for all and preserving our planet are attainable goals. we know that we have the resources and the capabilities to achieve a world free from poverty. we have begun implementing the sdgs, albeit unevenly, but time is of the essence. we must accelerate the process if we are to leave no one behind. that has enormous meaning for peace, security and prosperity as well. poverty and economies that fail to produce employment opportunities are not fertile ground for peace to grow in and be nurtured.",Ethiopia,Africa,51.7711791992188,5.499050760252714,1510.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,2.6490066225165565
MDG,73,2018,"if i have the privilege and honour to speak today on behalf of the malagasy people before the general assembly, it is because madagascar has gone through a period of exceptional democratic success, which has been warmly welcomed by many observers and seen as real democratic progress, to use the words said on that occasion. i will come back to that later. i extend to you, madam president, my sincere congratulations on your election. i am confident that your determination will give new impetus to our collective efforts to consolidate our organization with a view to making it even more credible and closer to our peoples and capable of effecting real change in their daily lives, because that is its mission. we have also heard your call and that of the secretary-general for the strengthening of multilateralism and international cooperation in the current difficult context of fragmentation, polarization and withdrawal. be assured that madagascar will actively support you throughout your mandate. madagascar, strongly committed to the values of unity, fraternity and peace advocated by the united nations, intends, like all of us here who are striving to promote the welfare of our peoples, to contribute to the most representative and democratic platform for global exchange, namely, the general assembly. all the speakers who have taken the floor in succession have highlighted the transformations taking place in the world, characterized by multipolarization, increasing economic globalization, the frenetic pace of the computerization of society and broad cultural diversity. much progress has been made but, as the secretary- general has again pointed out, our world suffers from a lack of trust, the reconsideration of policies and a very strong sense of insecurity feelings that are exacerbated by inequalities in development and the surge in global challenges that have not yet been mastered, such as climate change and terrorism, not to mention the iniquitous severity of poverty and disease. we are all witnessing humanitarian crises caused by conflicts affecting millions of people, including migration crises, terrorist attacks and security threats in certain regions, to name but a few. the theme chosen for this session places us at the heart of the major issues that drive the world today. it challenges us with regard to the role of the organization in the face of the disruptions that are undermining our societies today. the challenge of sustainable development and the ambitious 2030 agenda for sustainable development require a strong and effective organization that engages all member states. the world is changing and evolving. that requires the organization to adapt to it in order to bring about greater coherence in its approaches and responses. achieving the sustainable development goals (sdgs) is a sure way not only to establish development but also to fight inequality and guarantee human rights, with a view to promoting social inclusion, a sine qua non condition for lasting peace. sustainable development, to which we aspire, must necessarily involve the preservation of the environment, which must be a priority if we are to more effectively eradicate extreme poverty and ensure the sustainability and viability of our planet. in that context, i welcome the secretary-generals initiative to convene a summit on climate change next year, and i hope that special attention will be paid to developing countries, particularly the least developed countries and small island states, so that they can adapt their economic development processes to evolving environmental hazards. in this day and age, advocacy for women and girls cannot be ignored. we cannot turn a blind eye to the deplorable conditions in which many women around the world live, not to mention the many forms of gender- based violence. girls and women remain at the heart of the future of humankind. there is therefore a need to condemn with one voice the injustices of modern slavery, trafficking in persons and the worst forms of child labour, which particularly affect women and girls. let us give ourselves the means to improve the fate of humankind by looking after our mothers, sisters and daughters, to whom we must grant an equitable sharing of responsibilities. it is also essential to act in the area of global health, which has an impact on the achievement of the sdgs, especially in africa. madagascar can attest to that. the obstacles have been numerous and difficult i would just mention the improvement of access to treatment and medicines and the specific commitment of all communities, especially in terms of prevention and investment. but it is necessary to persevere, and, with the support of our partners, a universal health coverage system has been implemented. with the support of the entire united nations family, madagascar was declared polio-free this year. the 2030 agenda is a multisectoral programme for inclusive, equitable and sustainable development that seeks not to exclude any segment of the population. however, such a programme will remain a dead letter if it is not given the institutional and financial resources necessary to achieve its objectives. in that regard, madagascar fully supports the reforms undertaken by the secretary-general and the secretariat. those reforms are certainly very ambitious, but we are counting on the active involvement of member states for their implementation. with regard to resolution 72/279, entitled repositioning of the united nations development system in the context of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the united nations system, madagascar welcomes the consensus that led to the adoption of that resolution in may. we also welcome the reforms undertaken at the country team level and the role of the resident coordinators of the united nations system. the resolution points the way forward so that, in full consultation with, and by the mutual agreement of, governments the system can align more quickly with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. that will ensure that better account is taken of the realities, needs and priorities of member states so that the implementation of the 2030 agenda programme truly benefits the populations. in that context, the accelerators of madagascars development process for achieving the sdgs were identified after implementing the mainstreaming, acceleration and policy support strategy at the end of april. the third general population and housing census of madagascar was just completed, with the support of the united nations system and other partners, such as the european union. the results will provide important insights into population dynamics and development, as well as the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the sdgs. they will be taken into account when we begin to draft our next national development plan, for the period 2020-2024. the ultimate goal of the united nations system is to maintain lasting peace for development in the world. considerable and commendable achievements attest to the progress achieved, but we must admit that much remains to be done given the persistent challenges facing the world and the unsatisfied aspirations. a world of peace and prosperity cannot be built by the isolated action of a single organization or a few individuals, communities or groups of states. it requires the implementation of convergent and consensual actions determined by the aspirations of each party. although most countries are recognized as democracies worldwide, the option of democratic governance is still one of the contemporary political concepts that does not always enjoy unanimous support among nations. the malagasy people, for their part, have always shown a particular interest in joint actions to safeguard democratic achievements. they have always been of the conviction that progress in democracy ensures the stability that is essential for development and is a precondition for international cooperation. we are reminded of that when we look at the historic step our country is taking in its ongoing quest for achieving mature democracy. madagascar is today at a crossroads. under our constitution, the presidential term is to be shortened by a few months if the incumbent president runs for his own succession. in that purer spirit of a republic, the president of the malagasy republic, his excellency mr. hery rajaonarimampianina rakotoarimanana, who was democratically elected in 2013, submitted his resignation on 7 september, thereby upholding a constitutional requirement that is certainly unusual but was felt to be necessary by the malagasy people at a particular moment in their history. for the first time, the constitutional provisions prescribing the transfer of presidential powers to the president of the senate were implemented without any other process. the latter will therefore be responsible for ensuring the continuity of the state and the regular functioning of public services until the arrival of a new president of the republic, whose inauguration is already scheduled for 25 january 2019. that task will include ensuring that the ongoing electoral process is properly conducted. it is important to note in that respect that madagascar is not in a phase of political transition in the sense usually understood when political divides lead to a suspension of the constitution. on the contrary, in the present case we have simply submitted to the expression of the will of the sovereign people that is inscribed in the constitution. the situation is part of the continuity of our national political life and is certainly marked by a brief stage prescribed by fundamental sovereign law itself. the former secretary-general. the late kofi annan, said that no nation is born democratic. the situation in our country today shows a clear desire to consolidate progress towards democracy. in parallel with that key phase in our democracy, which is underpinned by a will for peace that seeks to maintain political stability at all costs, we have over the past four years been able to restore macroeconomic balance. we have seen positive changes in our basic indicators. we have restored confidence and relations between national and international stakeholders, and we can therefore look forward to an economic growth rate that is expected to exceed 5 per cent this year, which will be the best performance in 10 years. in the agricultural sector, which involves 80 per cent of the population, we have seen an increase in production and productivity, particularly in rice, thanks to public and private investment in hydro-agricultural infrastructure and research in improved and adapted seeds, as well as new practices and techniques. with respect to energy, madagascar is going through a period of energy transition. we have seen a significant increase in clean and renewable energy, especially in the form of hydroelectric power plants and photovoltaic power plants, to mention only what has just been handed over to the people of ambatolampy and ambohipihaonana in june. i am quite proud to say that it is the largest power plant of its kind in the indian ocean region and among the largest in sub-saharan africa. madagascar can reasonably expect a reduction in the cost of electricity by 2020 as a result of that type of project, despite the increase in the price of oil on the international market. exports have also performed well. the foreign exchange market has been under control, and inflation may decrease to 7 per cent by the end of the year. in the social sector, education and health have improved significantly. since 2014, we have built 24 centres for accelerating the reduction of maternal and child mortality and 315 basic health-care centres. the national radiotherapy centre will soon be completed to treat cancers. we have also set up 30 operating rooms in hard-to-reach areas. with regard to education, we have been able to recruit 44,000 new teachers since 2015, representing a 30 per cent increase in the total number of teachers. we have also built 1,087 classrooms and have fed more than 354,100 students in school cafeterias. the same improvement was recorded in the tourism sector, particularly in airport infrastructure and reception buildings. in the interest of good governance, we have adopted several laws to fight corruption and the illicit trafficking in our resources. the structural reform programme is well under way, including the implementation of the anti-corruption programme. in short, all those data points are indicators of stability and reveal growth that deserves support and consolidation. but despite all those efforts and despite the potential of the country, madagascar is still undergoing hardship. we are aware of the need for stability, which is the guarantee of development. the country cannot be held hostage to a political crisis any longer. the people understand that, given the fact that the country has suffered so much. the example had to come from the top. that is why president rajaonarimampianina willingly complied with the constitutional provisions by submitting his resignation. madagascar is therefore seeking support from all of its development partners for the electoral process currently under way, the outcome of which is a source of hope for the malagasy people. i also take this opportunity to reiterate the call to all to foster effective synergy within the organization to promote the building of a better future, for which all nations have a right to hope. before concluding, i join my predecessors in paying tribute to a worthy son of our continent, our former secretary-general the late kofi atta annan. on the strength of his convictions, that fervent defender of multilateralism worked to rethink and build a stronger organization that is better able to alleviate the ills of many people around the world in the name of humankind. he will undoubtedly remain a source of inspiration for all. finally, i would like to conclude by recalling that this year marks the seventieth anniversary of the adoption of the instrument that has best served humankind: the universal declaration of human rights. may it continue to inspire and guide us in the struggles that still lie ahead of us for a new world order where no one will ever again be left behind. may god keep us.",Madagascar,Africa,76.6796798706055,3.049069056559969,2285.0,8.0,0.0,8.0,3.50109409190372
GIN,73,2018,"at the outset, on behalf of the president, the government and the people of the republic of guinea, i would like to convey our sincere condolences on the death of mr. kofi annan, a great son of africa and former secretary- general of the united nations, who dedicated his life to promoting peace, international humanitarian law and multilateralism. my delegation would like to congratulate the president on her election to lead the general assembly at its seventy-third session and to assure her of its support for the success of her term. guinea would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to her predecessor, mr. miroslav lajcak, for his inclusive presidency of the general assembly at its seventy-second session, during a crucial period of reform of our organization. my delegation also warmly congratulates secretary-general antonio guterres on his vision and the commendable efforts he has taken to give a new impetus to the united nations, which is beset by political, economic and social challenges in an ever-changing international context. it is clear that, in addressing those challenges, we must give priority to new, more pragmatic, effective and coordinated approaches to achieving the objectives set out in the charter of the united nations. the seventy-third session, under this years theme of making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, calls on us to urgently strengthen the global leadership of the united nations with respect to the requirements of reform and the aspirations contained in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. we must recall that the united nations was created in the aftermath of one of humankinds most devastating wars, suffered the stigma of the cold war and was shaken by the turbulences linked to the end of that same cold war. however, it has resisted all attempts to weaken it by making it ineffective at managing certain crises that threaten peace and stability throughout the world. in an increasingly interdependent world, the united nations is the only multilateral platform capable of adopting a global and concerted approach in seeking solutions to the many challenges it faces. during a period of deep crisis for the organization, secretary- general kofi annan recalled the following: [a] group of far-sighted leaders... saw that the human race had only one world to live in, and that unless it managed its affairs prudently, all human beings might perish. so they drew up rules to govern international behaviour and founded a network of institutions, with the united nations at its centre, in which the peoples of the world could work together for the common good. (a/58/pv.7, p.3) today, the purposes and principles contained in the charter of the united nations remain more relevant than ever. the universality of the united nations in maintaining international peace, security and prosperity in the world is confirmed on a daily basis. the multiple fields of action make it possible to assist member states in their development processes. that is why we must remain determined and resolutely committed to implementing the reforms that are crucial for our organization. the republic of guinea supports that ongoing reform process, initiated by secretary-general, in particular in the pillars of peace, security and sustainable development. guinea cannot insist enough on the need for security council reform. it is time to take into account africas demographic, political and economic importance in order to give it the role it can and must play on the international stage and to redress the injustice the continent has suffered by granting it two permanent seats and as many non-permanent seats. the results of the reform must ultimately lead to the establishment of a fair and equitable system of international cooperation based on solidarity and shared responsibility. the seventy-third session of the general assembly coincides this year with the sixtieth anniversary of the republic of guineas independence, on 2 october 1958. in the same year, it joined the organization as the eighty- second state member of the united nations. as we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of our independence, we will be flying the flag of pan-africanism. it is clear that the united nations has been and remains for guinea a multilateral forum that has enabled it to realize the ideals for it has struggled so much, including its pan-african vision of independence, the fight against apartheid, the promotion of peace and security, and the socioeconomic development of the continent. today, under the dynamic leadership of the president of the republic of guinea, his excellency mr. alpha conde, our country has made significant progress in the economic and social fields, which can guarantee a better future for the people of guinea. the megaprojects carried out in the energy and agriculture sectors and the creation of infrastructure that is crucial to development have been welcomed by the guinean people because they are convinced that those achievements will certainly lead to guineas development by 2040. based on the priorities of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the 2063 agenda of the african union, guinea has focused on the ownership and implementation of the 17 sustainable development goals. in this context, our country, at the third high- level political forum on sustainable development, presented its first voluntary national review for 2018 on the implementation of the 2030 agenda. that was a timely opportunity for my country to share with other member states its experience in the process of implementing its sustainable development programme by 2040. the governments determination to contribute to the achievement of the sustainable development goals was supported by the 2016-2020 national economic and social development plan, guided by the forward- looking guinea vision 2040 plan, which aims to make development planning the appropriate instrument for achieving the sustainable development goals. in this regard, guinea is counting on the support of the united nations and other partners. the government strongly appreciates the new climate of dialogue for the promotion of sustainable peace in africa, as peace and security are essential conditions for inclusive development. the tangible progress achieved in the strategic partnerships between the united nations and african peace missions, as well as the significant progress in crisis management in guinea-bissau, south sudan, somalia and in the disputes between ethiopia and eritrea and between eritrea and djibouti, confirm once again the need to continue to focus on political solutions to create a peaceful environment conducive to development. we are convinced that substantial investments in conflict prevention and the quest for political solutions will save humankind countless lives and the destruction of infrastructure. however, these positive developments that have been made here and there should not distract us from our common struggle against international terrorism and violent extremism. that is why my delegation strongly condemns the barbaric acts committed against innocent people in africa and throughout the world. it urges the major powers to support africa in its fight against these scourges and to support the group of five for the sahel in confronting the atrocities committed by terrorist groups so as to restore lasting peace in the sahel region. guinea welcomes the implementation of the united nations support plan for the sahel, entitled sahel, land of opportunities, which targets 10 countries, including guinea. the plan focuses on six key areas: cross-border cooperation, prevention, peacekeeping, inclusive growth, climate and renewable energy. partnerships with member states, regional economic communities, civil society and donors will facilitate the implementation of various development projects, help to fight extreme poverty, improve the humanitarian situation, strengthen resilience to change and reduce the scourge of food insecurity. if there is another situation where the role of the united nations remains indisputable, it is the conflict in the middle east, which remains a major concern for the international community. guinea has always unambiguously expressed its unconditional solidarity with the just cause of the palestinian people. we remain convinced that any viable and sustainable solution in the middle east necessarily means respecting and implementing the relevant security council resolutions that call for the creation of two states living side by side in security and within safe and internationally recognized borders. conflicts in particular protracted crises environmental degradation and human rights violations continue to increase humanitarian needs, which are currently estimated at nearly $22.5 billion. however, the mobilization of funds is hampered not only by a lack of solidarity but also the drastic cuts to the united nations budget. that is why the management of generated funds must be transparent and inclusive. of all the humanitarian challenges, the issue of human mobility is the most consequential for us and therefore requires greater solidarity and the sharing of responsibilities. that is why we welcome the advent of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which is a source of hope for more than 258 million international migrants, composed largely of women and children. this important document, which the republic of guinea will adopt in december in marrakech, will strike a balance between state sovereignty and fundamental rights. the compact is fundamentally aligned with the sustainable development goals, the paris agreement on climate change and the new york declaration for refugees and migrants, while providing an important monitoring mechanism. the achievement of social well-being through the sustainable development goals can be made possible only if we succeed in ridding our world of recurring diseases. it is therefore important to strengthen our solidarity in the fight against communicable and non-communicable diseases, which continue to decimate a large part of the worlds population. my delegation welcomes the steps taken and the progress made in effectively eradicating tuberculosis, hiv/aids and other diseases. we wholeheartedly support the united nations project for universal health coverage. the creation of an inclusive society underpins the elimination of inequalities and social barriers that prevent the participation of young people and women in economic and political activities. gender equality and the promotion and empowerment of young people and women are fundamental to achieving sustainable development and must be taken into account in development policies. i take this opportunity to congratulate the secretary- general, who has been working since his inauguration for the achievement of parity through appointments to the higher bodies of the united nations. we have a responsibility to perpetuate that good practice within the united nations and other international and national institutions, as it is in line with the agreements on gender and womens rights. i would like to conclude by emphasizing that the united nations remains the only institution that can maintain global balance and ensure our collective security and shared prosperity. any withdrawal into ourselves would be detrimental to peace and stability around the world. multilateralism therefore remains the only way forward to effectively achieve the goals enshrined in the charter of the united nations.",Guinea,Africa,39.6176795959473,2.384320020675659,1784.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.681614349775785
CAF,73,2018,"first of all, i would like to extend my warm congratulations to the republic of ecuador, and especially to ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces, on her well-deserved election as president of the general assembly at its seventy-third session. i can assure her of my countrys full support for the fulfilment of her mandate. i would also like to commend mr. miroslav lajcak for his work and the remarkable results achieved during the seventy- second session, which have contributed significantly to strengthening cooperation among our states. i would also like to express my gratitude and reiterate our confidence in secretary-general antonio guterres for his ongoing commitment to peace and development in the world, and especially for the constant and multifaceted support for my country, the central african republic. i would also like to take this opportunity to pay a heartfelt tribute to the great african and world leader, kofi annan, who passed away on 18 august. i salute his memory and acknowledge his tireless efforts at the helm of the united nations with a view to building a better world. this seventy-third session is exploring an important theme. i therefore come to share our contribution in order to ensure that the united nations remains relevant for all in the context of a global partnership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. in the twenty-first century, that goal requires structural reforms within our organization, which for more than 70 years has made considerable gains that must be consolidated even if challenges and weaknesses still remain. the aim of the current session is to promote reflection on how our common organization should address the new challenges facing the world and our societies today, such as terrorism, violent extremism, climate change, migration and poverty. the role of the united nations through the combined efforts of member states in multilateral action has led to major advances in global peace, security and development. that was true yesterday for the emancipation of people through self-determination. it is still true today in the search for solutions to increasingly complex problems violent extremism and international terrorism, the eradication of poverty, the persistence of conflicts in the world, lingering economic and social inequalities, the widening development gap among states and the massive violation of human rights. that is why my country, the central african republic, will continue to support the central role of the united nations in preserving and maintaining peace and security in the world. the global leadership embodied by the united nations must be strengthened and equipped with the necessary tools to respond effectively to current challenges, while ensuring a better division of labour among member states. my country supports the position of the african union, which seeks africas full representation in all united nations bodies, especially the security council, which is the main decision-making body of our common organization in matters related to international peace and security. it is high time to correct the historical inequality that continues to deprive africa of a permanent seat on the security council with veto power. in the same vein, my country joins the african voice in supporting an increase in the number of members elected by the general assembly to the security council. that will allow for a fairer and more balanced participation in that organ, which will ensure a more representative role in the promotion of international peace. the rise of terrorism and violent extremism is a serious threat to international security. it seriously undermines social cohesion in our countries, exposes our populations to indiscriminate violence, generates a succession of humanitarian crises and thwarts development efforts. given that grim reality, africa is showing its willingness to overcome regional divisions, pool resources and lay the foundations for a holistic and coherent approach that contributes to the development of a global doctrine against those prevailing asymmetric threats. that is the best strategy for preventing and combating those scourges through specific responses adapted to our environment within the framework of the global peace and security architecture. another concern today is the problematic extent of the migration phenomenon. when well managed, migration can have a substantial positive impact on the development of countries of origin and significant benefits for destination countries. when poorly managed, migration can have serious consequences for the well-being of countries and migrants, with a high probability of destabilizing national and regional security. that is why my country welcomes the holding in december of an intergovernmental conference on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration in marrakech, morocco, and hopes that the forum will lead to constructive proposals. on an equally important note, our planet continues to suffer the effects of natural phenomena such as earthquakes, rainfall, drought, the rapid advance of the desert and global warming. i would therefore like to take this opportunity to encourage all states that are signatories to the paris agreement under the united nations framework convention on climate change to join efforts to preserve our shared environment and to ensure sustainable development for our planet. i would also like to take this opportunity to discuss the situation in my country, the central african republic. but first, i want to honour the memory of all those who have fallen in the exercise of their perilous and noble peace mission in the central african republic. i would like to convey the tremendous gratitude of the people of the central african republic to the entire international community for all its sacrifices to bring peace to my country. for two and a half years, my government has been working tirelessly to restore the fundamental values that underpin democracy, freedom and human rights. to that end, we are working to re-establish state authority by continuing to gradually deploy state administration and services in our provinces and to restore basic social services. on the other hand, we deplore the continuing tragic and painful attacks perpetrated by the enemies of peace, who are driven by dark and selfish interests. they have been fuelling the bloody violence since the beginning of the year, both in the capital and in the interior of the country, with an increase in violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. notwithstanding all those challenges, the government has maintained the momentum of reforms in the security and defence sectors, where significant progress has been made, namely, the gradual deployment of the central african internal defence and security forces and the implementation of the national disarmament, demobilization, repatriation and reintegration programme. in that regard, i welcome the commitment made by the european union and our bilateral partners to supporting the training and bolstering of our defence and security forces, on the one hand, and to supporting the implementation of the national defence plan and the deployment of the central african armed forces, with a view to setting up a garrison army and establishing control throughout the national territory, on the other hand. we are also eternally grateful to the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in the central african republic (minusca), the united states of america, the peoples republic of china, the russian federation and france for the material support provided to the central african armed forces. our ambition is to see them become truly operational and to contribute, alongside minusca, to the immense effort to stabilize and restore lasting peace to the central african republic. but, in order to do so, allow me to reiterate from this rostrum our call for the total lifting of the arms embargo still weighing on our national army. the reconstruction programme for the central african republic requires a coherent framework as embodied in the national recovery and peacebuilding plan, which is being implemented and has already seen the government and its international partners launch 21 projects regarding basic social services. that tangible progress is the fruit of the multifaceted, invaluable and commendable support of our strategic partners, such as the world bank, the african development bank, the european union and the french development agency. we have also dedicated ourselves to the fight against impunity through substantial support for the rehabilitation of the national judicial system, which, among other things, has enabled our criminal court to hold two sessions this year to try common law cases. moreover, the special criminal court will soon begin its first investigations, while the government has established the framework for the truth, justice, reparations and reconciliation commission. in that context, one year since its operationalization in september 2017, the panel of facilitators of the african initiative for peace and reconciliation in the central african republic has concluded two rounds of consultations and a meeting with armed groups to hear their demands for an inclusive dialogue. i am pleased to recall that the african initiative is the one and only reference framework for all those willing to support the central african people on the path to dialogue. in that regard, i continue to urge all the friends of the central african republic to generously assist us through robust support for the efforts of the panel of facilitators of the african initiative, whose accomplishments to date must be consolidated. my greatest wish is to enable my compatriots to resolve their differences once and for all in good faith and to strengthen the ancestral ties that bind them. today, the government and the people of the central african republic are firmly committed to strengthening the democratic process and the economic recovery in the country. given the many challenges that beset our history, we will be patient but determined in our actions, vigilant and aware of the magnitude of the task that lies ahead. for my part, i can affirm my determination to spare no effort to create the necessary conditions for the reconciliation and the reconstruction of my country in order to give back to the central africans, my people, the joy and the desire to live together. i extend our eternal gratitude to all our partners and to the entire international community for their ongoing concern for our well-being. in conclusion, i hope that the international community will remain mobilized alongside the central african people and work together with the government for the recovery of my country. i wish our work every success.",Central African Republic,Africa,37.3958206176758,1.565875968175352,1698.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.1778563015312131
DZA,73,2018,"allow me at the outset to express my warm and fraternal congratulations to ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces on her outstanding election to preside over the general assembly at its seventy-third session. her vast experience in international political affairs will undoubtedly contribute greatly to the successful conduct of the work of the assembly. in our capacity as vice-president elected by the assembly, we assure her of our full support in carrying out her noble task. i would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to mr. miroslav lajcak for his dedicated commitment in the way he managed the previous session. i am also deeply grateful to secretary-general antonio guterres for his enlightened leadership and for his laudable initiatives since he assumed his post. his efforts are aimed at giving renewed impetus to our organization, particularly in the essential domains pertaining to international peace, security and development. it is highly regrettable that the entire world continues to experience an unprecedented and multifaceted crisis; the secretary-general was right in warning about the risks that that entails. he rightly warned that conflicts had worsened and that new dangers are emerging (see a/73/pv.6). global concerns related to nuclear weapons have not reached the current level since the second world war. environmental imbalances are occurring faster than our responses can deal with them, and the gap resulting from the current differences is growing wider, while gross human rights violations are taking place and nationalism and xenophobia are on the rise. in the context of the advanced and inevitable growth in globalization that we face, the seriousness of those colossal challenges, both old and new, are aggravated by the perverse effects of the continuing economic and financial crisis. against that backdrop, which has become even more alarming owing to the recent appearance of unilateral and protectionist trends, we must have the courage to recognize the inadequacy and futility of the policies that have been implemented to date and the structural deficiencies of the increasingly ineffective global governance architecture. when he acceded to the presidency of the general assembly at its twenty-ninth session, president abdelaziz bouteflika warned that membership in the united nations was not enough to protect nations against hunger and insecurity (see a/pv.2233). today, we can no longer accept the perpetuation of an international order that does not encourage the international values of peace, justice and development, as well as science and technology, while contributing to improving living conditions. that order has concentrated economic and financial resources in the hands of a small minority, widening the existing gap that separates the richest from the poorest countries and peoples. the unfortunate conclusion is that we are facing a real moral crisis. i would like to commend the rightness and appropriateness of the theme chosen for our session. indeed, now more than ever, the united nations must find ways and means that enable it to fully play the role that its founding fathers envisioned for it following the devastation of a global confrontation. such a vital objective for the entire international community cannot be achieved without a renewed collective commitment to effective and real multilateralism, in harmony with the principles of the charter of the united nations a commitment to which the former secretary-general, the late kofi annan, a worthy son of africa and a committed citizen of the world, dedicated his life and with which he associated his name. while the united nations remains the distinctive forum for dialogue and cooperation among the nations of the world, it must also bring about the desired change. in our view, the genuine change that we seek and which is of the utmost priority requires us to mobilize all our capabilities and efforts with a view to reforming the united nations itself. it is imperative that the reform should involve both the structures and the operating methods of the organization, particularly the security council, by paying particular attention in the first place to redressing the historical injustice done to the african continent in terms of its underrepresentation in both membership categories of that body. the reform must also include the revitalization of the role of the general assembly and the strengthening of its authority a necessity around which there is, fortunately, a growing consensus. conscious of our responsibilities and contributions to the maintenance of international peace and security and with full respect for the cardinal principles of our foreign policy, algeria follows with particular interest the crises and conflicts facing the countries in our region. while continuing to fully play our role to the best of our ability, my country reiterates its conviction, on the basis of our own experience, that conflicts cannot be totally resolved without promoting solutions that are owned by the parties concerned and reached through inclusive dialogue and that place national interests above all other considerations, thereby preserving the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of states. whether related to the situations in mali, libya, syria or yemen, only such an approach can enable those sisterly countries to restore peace and stability so that they may begin their rebuilding process. with regard to the western sahara issue, which comes before the united nations as an issue of decolonization, algeria believes that its settlement can be achieved only by allowing the people of the western sahara to exercise their inalienable and non-assignable right to self-determination. my country reiterates its firm support for the efforts of the secretary-general and his personal envoy for western sahara and expresses the hope that their actions, together with the input of the african union, will contribute to the resumption of negotiations without preconditions and in good faith between the two parties to the conflict, namely, the kingdom of morocco and the polisario front, with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable political solution that ensures the self-determination of the people of western sahara. in the same vein, algeria is convinced that only a solution based on international legitimacy and the recognition of the inalienable national rights of the palestinian people, including their right to establish an independent state with al-quds al-sharif as its capital, can put a definitive end to the conflict that has existed in the middle east for seven decades. terrorism, of which algeria was the first target at the end of the last century, has now become one of the most destructive scourges on the planet. at the cost of heavy sacrifices, my country was able to confront it alone by adopting an approach and by harnessing methods that have proved to be effective. that experience, which we are willing to share, was based on the conviction that addressing terrorism must imperatively tackle its root causes and must be accompanied by a policy that is resolute against violent extremism. the international community is particularly called upon to ensure that the fight against terrorism is accompanied by measures to fight extremism and the promotion of policies that advocate coexistence. in that context, i am pleased to recall that the united nations resolution declaring 16 may as the international day of living together in peace (resolution 72/130), which was initiated by algeria, is part of the efforts to promote the principle of an inclusive dialogue leading the quest for solutions to the challenges to stability at both the national and the international levels. we are proud that the values and principles of living together in peace were the basis of the policy of civil harmony and national reconciliation, which was implemented with determination by president abdelaziz bouteflika of the republic of algeria in order to end the national tragedy and reconcile algerians with each other. those unifying ideals are considered above all to be the common factor among the strategies, policies and programmes that were implemented in the various economic, social, educational, cultural and religious fields. those same principles consistently guide my countrys foreign policy in our relations with neighbouring countries and other countries of the world. the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the addis ababa action agenda of the third international conference on financing for development are remarkable achievements that require the substantial mobilization of both the means and the capabilities for their implementation. we express the hope that the outcome of the high-level meeting on financing the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which was convened by the secretary-general on 24 september, will provide a solid foundation for concerted action between the united nations system and member states for development in line with the aspirations of developing countries, as advocated by the group of 77. algeria, which participated actively in the development of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, is about to finalize its national progress report for 2016-2018 on the implementation of the sustainable development goals, for voluntary submission to the economic and social council in july 2019. that is part of the new development agenda adopted by algeria in 2016. it is a policy that aims to place algeria among emerging countries by 2035, enabling it to diversify and transform its economy through the revival and consolidation of its economic growth. that will benefit all its citizens, as well as countries of the region as a whole. before concluding, i cannot but commend the efforts made by our national authorities regarding the recent constitutional review, which seeks to benefit all segments of algerian society, in particular the rights of women and supporting them to be independent, as well as support for young people in order to ensure their effective integration into the countrys economic and social development process. those efforts have earned the recognition of the international community for their focus on promoting both human rights and stability and security. we are honoured by such acknowledgements and feel reassured in our global approach. the rejection of policies based on force, with the dangers that they entail, requires that we constantly seek, through dialogue and consensus, to strengthen multilateral action. in our view, that is the best way to respond to the global security and development challenges facing the nations and countries of the world. through its focus on demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness for which everyone yearns, the united nations plays a central role in the endeavour to restore the respect owed to it. the success of the united nations is a success for all. we must work to make it a forum not only for discussing our differences but also for resolving them. our organization should be the place where our partnerships are forged. we particularly commend the general assemblys unanimous acceptance of the concept of living together in peace. algeria believes that failure to live in peace is not inevitable. conflicts, human tragedies, terrorism and environmental disasters do not affect only certain people and not others. destiny is a common thing, as president bouteflika said. we are called on to make the united nations a unique means to serve peaceful and sustainable societies. given our conviction and approach, algeria will in all cases be a loyal and committed partner for achieving peace and development.",Algeria,Africa,81.4078369140625,5.812751272017596,1831.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0922992900054613
BFA,73,2018,"in the 73 years since our organization was created, ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces is the fourth woman to be elected president of the general assembly, and only the second in half a century. her election deserves to be particularly welcomed and that is why, on behalf of his excellency mr. roch marc christian kabore, president of burkina faso, whom i have the honour to represent here, as well as on behalf of my delegation, i offer her my warmest and most sincere congratulations. burkina faso, a vice-president of the general assembly at this session, will spare no effort to ensure the success of our work. to the secretary-general, mr. antonio guterres, whose actions since he took office have not gone unnoticed, i reaffirm burkina fasos full support for his commitment and determination to bring about important and ambitious reforms to make the united nations more effective. before continuing, i want to spare a thought for the brotherly and friendly people of indonesia, who have been severely tested today by an earthquake and a tsunami. on behalf of president kabore, i extend our sincere condolences and deepest sympathies to the government and the people of indonesia and to the families of the victims. we also wish the many injured a swift recovery. burkina faso has been tirelessly pursuing its efforts to strengthen democracy and consolidate the rule of law through many measures, including finalizing the preliminary draft of our new constitution and, on 30 july, revising the law on the electoral code. referendum consultations are scheduled for 2019. our future constitution, drafted in a consultative framework, aims to strengthen human rights and civil liberties, taking into account other new provisions, such as access to land for all, the right to clean drinking water, the right to employment and the abolition of the death penalty. further provisions are planned to introduce balance into the distribution of power. in addition, the process of revising the electoral code will pave the way for burkina faso citizens overseas to vote, allowing them to participate in the presidential elections in 2020 for the first time in our countrys history. meanwhile, many other reforms have been launched to improve political and economic governance, modernize the administration, consolidate public finances and strengthen the independence of the judiciary, as well as human rights. on the economic front, despite a difficult security and social context, burkina faso has attained a growth rate of 6.7 per cent thanks to the consolidation of public finances, the initiation of reforms to improve tax revenues and the structuring of projects launched within the framework of the national economic and social development plan. the fruits of that growth have been redistributed by building infrastructure and adopting social measures in favour of our most underprivileged citizens, particularly women and girls. our free health-care policy has significantly improved care for pregnant women and children under the age of five and will continue with the operationalization of a universal health-insurance system that will gradually enable health-care coverage to be extended to all burkina faso citizens. in terms of public health and access to drinking water, substantial efforts have been made to benefit rural and urban areas. likewise, our special job- creation programme for young people and women aims to promote their access to jobs and acquisition of vocational skills, with a view to opening up opportunities for their sustainable integration into the labour market. in addition, an integrated womens empowerment programme aims to strengthen their productive capacities and their participation in burkina fasos economic and social development by 2020. burkina faso remains very concerned about the insecurity and terrorist attacks that it has been subjected to for the past three years. once limited to our northern regions, the terrorist threat has gradually spread to other areas, especially the south-west and the east, which border on cote divoire and ghana and the niger, benin and togo respectively. in the space of three years, 229 civilians and military or paramilitary troops have been killed by armed terrorist groups. in order to tackle that worrying situation, my government is mobilizing all its human, financial, military, non-military and material resources to combat this terrible threat and ensure the peoples security. unfortunately, our unconscionable and faithless enemies will stop at nothing to sow their seeds of terror. their new modus operandi is the use of improvised explosive devices. to provide some context, they have blown up two vehicles this week alone using such fatal devices, killing 14 members of our defence and security forces participating in security operations within our borders. besides attacking our defence and security forces, symbols of the state, the terrorists have been targeting civilians, students and teachers. more than 520 schools have closed, depriving nearly 56,000 students of their right to an education owing to the terrorist threat. by targeting schools, armed terrorist groups are attacking the education system generally, and thereby educated people people who would try to thwart the dissemination of the terrorists ideas and way of life. the terrorists know that an educated and enlightened person is more difficult to manipulate than one without education. far from causing us to lose heart, those attacks have reinforced our unity, solidarity and determination to defend the values that underpin burkina faso our republican form of government, democracy, secularism and social cohesion. in the fight against terrorism, one thing is unanimously acknowledged, which is that no one country can combat that threat alone. even by coming together, as the group of five for the sahel (g-5 sahel) countries have done in order to pool their efforts, the fact remains that our countries absolutely need the support of the international community to render the g-5 sahel joint force operational. beyond the countries directly affected by the terrible phenomenon of terrorism, the fight against terrorism is directly related to our broader need for international peace and security. indeed, in its resolution 72/165 of 19 december 2017, proclaiming 21 august the international day of remembrance of and tribute to the victims of terrorism, the general assembly reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to strengthening international cooperation to prevent and fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. in that regard, burkina faso appeals to the security council to place the g-5 sahel joint force under a mandate deriving from chapter vii of the charter of the united nations, with a view to ensuring that it receives sustainable and multilateral financing. i would also like to take this opportunity to recall that the security council, by its resolutions 2320 (2016) and 2378 (2017), has already expressed its intention to take concrete steps to establish the principles under which african union peace operations authorized by the security council should be funded through united nations assessed contributions, with decisions on funding specific missions to be taken on a case-by-case basis. at the seventy-second session, president lajcak reminded us that peace and prevention should be at the centre of everything the united nations does, because when we read the charter of the united nations, there are only five references to war. the word peace, however, appears 47 times (a/72/pv.3, p.5). therefore, pursuant to general assembly resolution 70/262 and security council resolution 2282 (2016), both adopted on 27 april 2016, the high-level meeting on peacebuilding and sustaining peace (see a/72/pv.83 et seq.) held from 24 to 25 april placed particular emphasis on prevention. indeed, prevention is at the heart of building and sustaining peace and must therefore be a primary objective for both states and the united nations. it is also the primary responsibility of national governments to determine the necessary priorities and strategies by involving every stratum of society. in order to consolidate peace, we must address the root causes of conflict, such as poverty, exclusion, discrimination and, indeed, the effects of climate change. it is for that reason that the government of burkina faso launched an emergency programme for the sahel for the period from 2017 to 2020 as a holistic response to the regions dual socioeconomic and security challenges, through the realization of socioeconomic infrastructure projects and the establishment of basic social services, as well as the promotion of production and processing activities as sources of income for the people in the northern areas of our country. initiatives for building and sustaining peace can succeed only if they receive sufficient, predictable, sustainable and coherent funding by involving multilateral and bilateral partners, as well as the private sector. burkina faso welcomes and applauds the support that it enjoys from the united nations system and from the european union in the implementation of that emergency programme. the purposes and principles of the charter of the united nations are aimed at achieving a world of peace, justice, solidarity and social well-being for all, on a planet that is not threatened by climate change. the support that many countries like burkina faso receive from the united nations system for their efforts to achieve development, and thereby the sustainable development goals, is highly appreciated. that is why we welcome the unanimous adoption of resolution 72/279, on repositioning the united nations development system, which provides for a revitalization of the role of the resident coordinator system. burkina faso welcomes the support given to the sahel countries through the united nations support plan for the sahel. the plan, which covers the period from 2018 to 2030, will improve coordination and strengthen collaboration among the partners in the region. in addition, it will help to implement the priorities identified for the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the african unions agenda 2063. it is now more necessary than ever that we defend and encourage multilateralism. that is the belief of burkina faso, and it must be a vision shared by all if we are to create a more open and more inclusive world. it is in the name of international solidarity that burkina faso is now engaged in six peacekeeping operations with more than 2,000 personnel, making our country a major actor in united nations peacekeeping operations. we are also one of the few countries one of only three, in fact that maintain a military contingent in guinea-bissau responsible for the security of its republican institutions. burkina faso is the largest troop-contributing country to the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali and the largest contributor of correctional officers to the united nations. in that capacity, we will succeed canada as chair of the group of friends of corrections in peace operations for a one-year term. because the credibility and effectiveness of the united nations also depend on its ability to prevent and manage crises and to promote international peace and security, burkina faso welcomes the reforms of management and of the peace and security pillar, which should improve the ability of the united nations to effectively carry out its mission of sustainable peace and social progress for citizens around the world. burkina faso commends the secretary-generals action for peacekeeping initiative and the holding of a high-level meeting on that initiative at this session. the adoption of the declaration of shared commitments on united nations peacekeeping operations highlights the achievements of peacekeeping operations and enables us to reaffirm our shared commitment to addressing the most pressing challenges. as peace, security, democracy, respect for human rights and development are intrinsically linked, we must work to ensure that all countries in crisis find peace. that is why burkina faso congratulates the government and the people of mali on their successful holding of presidential elections, despite the context there of terrorist threats, and calls on the malian political class to stand together in making every possible effort to overcome that enemy. the peace agreement between the political leaders of south sudan also merits high praise. on the subject of western sahara, burkina faso welcomes the announcement of the resumption of negotiations before the end of the year. the israeli-palestinian conflict continues to be of real concern, and burkina faso remains convinced that a solution must be political, peaceful, just and equitable, based on the existence of two states living side by side within secure and recognized borders. in asia, the commencement of dialogue between the two koreas is a good sign and should be encouraged and supported by the international community. burkina faso strongly endorses their dialogue. with regard to the economic, financial and commercial embargo against cuba, burkina faso calls for it to be completely lifted. the proliferation of small arms and light weapons poses a threat to peace and security in various parts of the world and is an obstacle to achieving the sustainable development goals. that is why my country welcomes the inclusion of ammunition in the final document (a/conf.192/2018/rc/3) of the third united nations conference to review progress made in the implementation of the programme of action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects. with regard to weapons of mass destruction, we condemn the resurgence of the use of chemical weapons in recent years and call for general and complete disarmament where all weapons of mass destruction concerned. humanitarian issues are of paramount importance in view of the growing number of refugees and migrants around the world. burkina faso therefore welcomes the inclusive negotiation process that has resulted in the drafting of consensus-based texts for a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, scheduled to be adopted at the intergovernmental conference on the global compact for migration, to be held on african soil in marrakech on 10 and 11 december. as a migration country, with at least 4 million citizens living abroad and nearly 25,000 refugees on its territory, burkina faso intends to play an active role in the adoption of the two global compacts on migration and on refugees. they should help not only to establish effective migration management around the world but also to better protect refugees and migrants. burkina faso also welcomes the organization on the margins of the seventy-third session of the general assembly of high-level events on topics such as tuberculosis and non-communicable diseases. there is no doubt that the recommendations resulting from those two events will contribute to improving the management of those diseases, which have a negative impact on peoples lives. intergovernmental negotiations on security council reform have been going on for more than 20 years, with 13 rounds of negotiations, but no comprehensive and satisfactory solution has emerged, even though the vast majority of member states agree in principle on having a security council that is more representative, better adapted to contemporary realities and better able to quickly respond to crises. with the support of the majority of member states, we must now move towards text-based negotiations, which is the only way to advance towards a genuine and consensual solution. we sincerely hope that we can achieve reform of the security council, as it would redress the injustice done to africa, which deserves a permanent place on the security council, and should have one. while all of the themes of the sessions of the general assembly command our attention, this years theme, making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, challenges us even more. its implementation also requires adequate representation for all member states in the bodies of our organization. in that connection, burkina faso calls for universal support for the candidacy of mr. brahima sanou for the post of deputy secretary-general of the international telecommunications union, in the elections scheduled for the unions plenipotentiary conference, to be held from 29 october to 16 november in the united arab emirates. despite its 73 years of existence, our organization must continue to work to strengthen itself and to assure people of its relevance and importance. building an equitable world in a peaceful and healthy environment is a shared and long-term undertaking and a responsibility that we all share. let us therefore trust our organization, the only framework that enables us to remain united in strong action and that creates greater hopes for the peoples of the world. to that end, i want to pay a well-deserved tribute to a great man and a worthy son of africa who stood at the helm of our shared organization. i am referring, of course, to the late mr. kofi annan.",Burkina Faso,Africa,39.3458518981934,5.488609790802002,2719.0,11.0,0.0,11.0,4.045605001838911
RWA,73,2018,"as we gather in this hall and work together to make the united nations more relevant to all people, the positive developments in africa over the past year merit this bodys attention. let me start with a paradox. in no other region is the sense of transnational solidarity and unity as deeply felt as in africa. the idea that our respective national identities stand in contradiction to pan-africanism is unheard of in our context. and yet, despite that unique civic endowment, africa has too often stood out for division and dysfunction in practice. that left africa unable to articulate and advance its common interests. we ceded responsibility for our future to others not by force but by default. but times are changing rapidly, and therefore the management of africas global position must also change. the trend on our continent is towards closer and more productive cooperation, both through the african union and our regional economic communities. the evident decline of old certainties and authorities is not bringing turbulence to africa, as would have been the case in a previous era. on the contrary, the effect has been to focus africas attention on the urgent need to get our house in order and fundamentally change how we do business. that is why the african union initiated a major financial and institutional reform more than three years ago. we are already seeing practical results. new financial discipline has produced an african union budget that is 12 per cent lower than last years. the share of funding supplied by member states has also increased substantially. contributions to the fund that helps pay for african union peace support operations are at the highest level since its establishment, in 1993. and earlier this year, the historic agreement on the african continental free trade area was signed, which was the culmination of decades of effort. once that is in force, africas place in the global economic and trade architecture will be redefined. economies of scale and higher levels of intra-african trade will help our continent attain the sustainable development goals by 2030. we will also see new possibilities for public-private partnership with africas growing private sector. this year also provided examples of regional security affairs and key political transitions being handled in a peaceful and forward- looking manner. more effective consultation and leadership is reducing the need for external mediation, and that is how it should be. the momentous developments in the horn of africa in eritrea, ethiopia, djibouti and even somalia are the most remarkable. the regions leaders deserve our full support as they set aside decades of mistrust and work towards a comprehensive settlement. it is important for the security council to collaborate closely with the african union to accompany that process of normalization. in zimbabwe as well, the next stages on the countrys path of progress warrant steady encouragement from the international community. however, there are other situations in africa notably in the central african republic, libya, the sahel and south sudan where serious problems remain unresolved, despite so much potential. africa and the world should come together and do what needs to be done to harmonize overlapping initiatives and ensure that agreements are respected. peace and security are the foundation of economic and social well-being. yesterday we happily marked the centenary of nelson mandelas birth with the nelson mandela peace summit. in that spirit, we are already set to embark upon a new chapter, with cooperation between the african union and the united nations on stable funding for african-union-mandated peace-support operations. the draft resolution to be introduced by africas three security council members has the full backing of the african union. that step will also align with the secretary-generals new action for peacekeeping initiative. that once again reflects the fact that the dividend of a more focused and functional africa benefits everyone. in that wider context of even stronger partnership between our institutions, it is important for the african unions diplomatic representation here at the united nations to be accorded the status and weight enjoyed by other regional bodies. the theme for this years general debate is making the united nations relevant to all people. that requires a commitment to achieving real multilateralism where it has too often been lacking. the current two-track system of global governance is unsustainable. a few get to be the ones to define the norms by which others shall be judged. but standards that do not apply to everyone equally are not universal. addressing that imbalance in the very foundation of our system is what will give shape to a revival of multilateral cooperation and renew the legitimacy of the international institutions that are so crucial to our planets future. in the years ahead, we look forward to deepening the important partnership between africa and the united nations and to advancing our shared agenda of peace and security, gender equality and womens empowerment, environmental protection and shared prosperity.",Rwanda,Africa,73.2155914306641,3.073750019073486,821.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,4.872107186358099
MLI,73,2018,"at the outset, i wish to convey the most cordial greetings of the malian people, from kayes to kidal and from sikasso to taoudenni, passing through konna in the mopti region. i would like to extend my warm congratulations to her excellency ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces on her election as president of the general assembly at its seventy-third session. that is a choice that honours her and, beyond that, her beautiful country of ecuador, with which mali has excellent relations in terms of cooperation. i wish to say to the president that, with the help of the united nations and of the international community, mali has today reached a significant milestone in its destiny following the successful presidential elections we recently held. as is customary, i should also like to congratulate the presidents predecessor, his excellency mr. miroslav lajcak of slovakia, for the outstanding results he achieved during the seventy-second session. let me also express my deepest gratitude to the secretary-general of our common organization, mr. antonio guterres, for his leadership and many initiatives aimed at further strengthening the effectiveness and credibility of the united nations. before continuing, i wish to pay shining tribute to the memory of the late kofi annan, former secretary- general, who was taken from us on 18 august. i remember him as a great african diplomat who worked throughout his life to promote international peace, security and development across the world. mali welcomes the presidents decision to place the current session under the theme making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. this theme is certainly of paramount importance for all states members of our organization. its aims and principles remain relevant, including in the areas of preventing and managing the many crises that we, the peoples of the united nations, face. for its part, mali commends the immense and multifaceted contribution of the united nations to its ongoing stabilization process. i would like to pay tribute to the women and men of united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali for their commitment and sacrifice in a complex and difficult security context. as leaders we have a collective responsibility to do more and better in order to render our organization even more relevant and effective for all. to do so, the united nations requires reforms that will lead to a peaceful, inclusive, equitable and sustainable international community. in that regard, mali welcomes the reforms initiated by the secretary-general in the spheres of development, peace and security. however, we need to reinforce those initiatives by agreeing to also reform some of the principal organs, including the security council and the general assembly, including when it comes to their respective compositions and working methods. it is also at the cost of those essential reforms that we will collectively be able to fulfil the deepest aspirations of our peoples and to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, as stipulated in the charter of the united nations. the year 2018 is devoted to pursuing and strengthening the democratic and republican steps taken by mali and its people towards peace, stability and development to the benefit of all populations of the sahel region, and indeed beyond. despite the numerous challenges that my country is facing, the presidential elections were able to take place within the constitutional timelines on 29 july and 12 august, in conditions welcomed by the entire international community. the inclusive nature of the organization of the elections, attested to by the participation of all political and civil society stakeholders, allowed citizens to freely express their choice and to prove the political, democratic and republican maturity of the malian people. for my part, upon the conclusion of the elections, i took full measure of the confidence that the malian nation had just renewed in me. that is why i am committed to restoring trust between the state and its citizens to further improve the countrys governance. moreover, i will work relentlessly for the diligent and inclusive implementation of the agreement for peace and reconciliation in mali, outcome of the algiers process, which, i will not cease to repeat, is the only alternative for my country to reconnect with peace and stability, a prerequisite for all development. to achieve those goals in the context of my country, a sacred union of all forces of the nation is required. likewise, i reiterate my unwavering commitment to give pride of place to dialogue and consultation in the management of public affairs. i remain determined to advance the peace process in mali to ensure that my country emerges from the worst crisis in its history. therefore, under my authority, the government and other malian actors, with the support of our partners, have achieved significant progress in the implementation of the agreement for peace and reconciliation. among these major achievements, i wish to underscore that there have been no clashes or confrontations between the malian armed forces and armed movements since the agreement on peace and reconciliation in mali was signed in may 2015. i also happily recall the restoration of malian authority to kidal and other areas of the country. the presence of the state in these regions, which were hit hard by the crisis, has made it possible, among other things, to open classes for the benefit of children and contributed to the gradual provision of the necessary basic services so that the people can enjoy the dividends of peace. moreover, i note with satisfaction the establishment and ongoing operationalization of territorial communities in the menaka and taoudenni regions, the establishment of interim authorities in the five northern regions, the launch of the operations of the operational coordination mechanism in kidal, timbuktu and gao, and progress in the processes of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and security-sector reform. i am fully aware that these gains are fragile. i am also aware that we need to do more and better. this is the purpose of the road map of 22 march. i have instructed the government to honour its commitments pursuant to these mechanisms. however, i must stress that political will alone will not be enough to fulfil all the commitments undertaken in the agreement. adequate technical and financial support will also be required. i take this opportunity to reiterate my call for the effective and rapid mobilization of the resources pledged by our partners with a view to helping us achieve all commitments contained in the road map by the agreed deadlines. i can also assure the assembly that the people of mali are most grateful for the active solidarity of the international community in the form of the presence and support of the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali, the european forces, the french operation barkhane, the group of five for the sahel (g-5 sahel), the african union, the economic community of west african states and neighbouring countries. in addition to the devastating effects of climate change on the living conditions of our population, the sahel has for several years faced terrorism, transnational organized crime and trafficking of all kinds, especially of drugs, arms, illicit goods and migrants, and money- laundering. a war for the anti-christ, from before the prophet; a war waged on behalf of darkness, in which death is not an accident, a battlefield casualty or even or a supreme sacrifice but the ultimate goal that is what we are dealing with in the sahel. it is all too easy to understand the urgency of the universal call to fight against terrorism. we established the g-5 sahel, comprising burkina faso, chad, mali, mauritania and the niger, in nouakchott in november 2014, to pool our efforts to address our regions security and development issues, having fully grasped the link between the fragility of states and the precariousness our populations at times experience, and how certain interests may seek to use it to subversive ends. however, the g-5 sahel joint force is struggling to become fully operational as it lacks the appropriate mandate and, in particular, sufficient funding. we believe that the fight against terrorism in the sahel is an important contribution to global security. that is why we continue to ask the security council to authorize the deployment of the force under chapter vii of the charter of the united nations, with adequate, sustainable and predictable funding, including through the united nations, so as to enable it to carry out his mandate consistently and effectively. in the same vein, we invite our bilateral and multilateral partners, who made pledges of financial contributions in february at the brussels conference, to honour those commitments to the g-5 sahel joint force. in parallel with the security response, the g-5 sahel is working to implement its priority investment programme to address development challenges, which are among the root causes of instability in our shared region. at the national level, i have made the fight against poverty one of the priorities of my second five-year term. during my swearing-in, on 4 september, i pledged before the malian people to do all in my power to optimize our system of national solidarity so as to forge a mali where no one is left behind. i want to launch a new social model based on equality and social justice and that will create the conditions for everyone to succeed. promoting malian youth will be at the centre of my work over the next five years. i have made young people the great cause of my second term. i will commit to a national youth pact through significant investments in renewing our education and training system, and to promote employment. in the same vein, i will not only continue but step up the implementation of major road infrastructure, agriculture, water, energy and social housing projects. i remain convinced that implementing these priority actions will accelerate the attainment of the sustainable development goals (sdgs) at the national level. in that regard, mali is pleased to have presented in july, here in new york, its voluntary national report on sdg implementation. as a country of origin and transit as well as a destination for migrants, mali welcomes the conclusion of negotiations on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration and, i would add, humane migration. this collective decision gives hope to the 250 million migrants throughout the world and, beyond them, to all of humankind at a time when migration has become a major issue for all states. mali will, of course, play an active role at the international conference to be held in marrakech in december with a view to the formal adoption of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which now offers us a comprehensive framework for managing migration governance globally. at the same time, mali will continue to shoulder its share of responsibility in managing migratory flows, in accordance with its national migration policy. despite our domestic situation, the people and government of mali remain attuned to the situation in africa and the rest of the world. in africa, we welcome the normalization of diplomatic relations between eritrea and ethiopia, as well as the conclusion of a peace agreement between our brothers in south sudan. we also thoroughly commend the successful holding of legislative elections in our fellow republic of mauritania, and praise the people of that brotherly and friendly nation for its political maturity and commitment to democracy. however, we are deeply concerned at the situation in libya, which regrettably continues to negatively impact the security and stability of the sahel region. in the light of this situation, which has lasted for too long, we call urgently on the international community to persuade the libyan parties to prioritize dialogue and seek a lasting solution to the crisis. we are also following with concern the situation in the middle east, especially in the occupied territories. the people of mali reaffirm their support to the brotherly people of palestine in their legitimate struggle for self-determination. the government of mali calls for the resumption of israeli-palestinian negotiations aimed at reaching a two-state solution, with israel and palestine living side by side in peace and within secure and internationally recognized borders. in humanitarian terms, mali is concerned about the precarious situation of the 65 million refugees and internally displaced persons worldwide as a result of armed conflicts, natural disasters and climate change. i am thinking in particular of my compatriots who are refugees in neighbouring countries, which i thank for their hospitality and generosity. i assure those compatriots that the government will spare no effort in continuing to assist them and to create the conditions for them to return home in safety and dignity. mali has never faltered in its belief in international solidarity and cherishes its cooperation with the united nations, which today provides us with a range of support. mali, which i have the privilege of leading today, reaffirms its commitment to playing its full part in building a peaceful, equitable and prosperous world for all. in conclusion, i reaffirm the profound gratitude of the people and thegovernment of mali to the united nations and our bilateral and multilateral partners for their unwavering support to the peace process in mali. for my part, i reaffirm my full commitment to sparing no effort to ensure that the agreement on peace and reconciliation in mali, emanating from the algiers process, is implemented diligently and fully.",Mali,Africa,35.4737701416016,3.558170080184937,2237.0,8.0,0.0,8.0,3.576218149307108
CMR,73,2018,"on behalf of his excellency paul biya, president of the republic of cameroon, i would first like to offer the president our sincere and warm congratulations on her election to lead the general assembly at its seventy-third session. this is a historic moment, given that she is only the fourth woman to preside over the assembly in the 73 years of the existence of the united nations. i am sure that her diplomatic background and knowledge of the united nations system will guarantee her success in the performance of her duties. i would also like to express my gratitude to her predecessor, mr. miroslav lajcak, who distinguished himself through his contribution to advancing the values of the organization we share. i would also like to congratulate secretary-general antonio guterres on his commitment to accomplishing the delicate tasks assigned to him by the charter of the united nations and on his efforts to carry out reforms aimed at achieving a more effective united nations that is focused on people and development. my delegation welcomes the theme that the president chose for this session, namely, making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. persistent hotbeds of tension, in particular in africa and the near and middle east, as well as the emergence of new issues such as terrorism, violent extremism, migration, natural disasters and climate change, to name but a few, threaten the foundations of our civilization and bring to the forefront the issue of the ability of the united nations to provide adequate responses to contemporary problems. the expanding scope of global public goods now makes it essential that the organization be capable of being, in the words of the charter, a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of those common ends. the growing complexity of the problems of our time, as well as the unprecedented interdependence of nations and peoples, require collective action and global solutions. the united nations is today the best reflection and embodiment of multilateralism, which is, more than ever before, the most appropriate way to respond to the challenges facing humankind. that is the very essence of our organization, which, it should be recalled, was created to save succeeding generations from war, promote social progress and create better living conditions for all peoples. to that end, my country believes that the role and future of the united nations continue to depend on the willingness of member states to strengthen its legitimacy, democratization and representativeness, so as not to leave anyone behind. that necessarily involves reforms of its organs, including the security council. in that respect, we cannot continue to marginalize africa, which remains the only continent that does not have a permanent seat in the main body in charge of international peace and security. the role and future of the united nations also depend on the equitable treatment of its three pillars: international peace and security, development and human rights. we must not lose sight of the fact that human beings, whose development depends on living conditions, are at the heart of the organizations objectives. the complex relationship between peace, development and human rights allows us to consider the eradication of poverty and the improvement of peoples living conditions as the surest means of achieving lasting peace, adequate protection of the individual and viable democracy. as president paul biya stated several years ago, democracy without development is a delusion that gives rise to terrible disappointments. in recent months, the news has been dominated in particular by moving images of men, women and children who lost their lives trying to cross seas and borders in search of a better future. we cannot remain insensitive to that issue. in the framework of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which will be adopted during the intergovernmental conference scheduled for december in morocco, we must acknowledge the fact that poverty, unemployment, weakening purchasing power and, in short, uncertain futures constitute so many violations of human dignity and, consequently, so many breaches of the peace, so many causes of political instability, so many drivers of migration, which, if nothing is done, will be neither safe nor orderly nor regular. the question of migratory flows should therefore draw the attention of our collective conscience and remind us of the importance of effective solidarity and shared prosperity. with regard to collective security, we remain convinced that the settlement of international or domestic disputes must be carried out in conformity with the principles of the charter of the united nations. in addition, we must redouble our efforts to achieve disarmament. in that regard, cameroon believes, however, that the attention and resources devoted to the issue of nuclear and chemical weapons should not overshadow the centrality of the problem posed by small arms and light weapons on the international agenda. it should be noted that, according to available statistics, more than 90 per cent of the victims of war around the world, and particularly in africa, are killed by that type of weapon. in addition, small arms and light weapons are increasingly falling into the hands of terrorist groups such as the islamic state, al-qaida in the islamic maghreb, boko haram and others. cameroon is pleased to have hosted, in yaounde from 11 to 13 june, the first central african convention for the control of small arms and light weapons, their ammunition and all parts and components that can be used for their manufacture, repair and assembly. under the leadership of my country, which holds the biennial presidency of that first conference, the central african states have unreservedly committed to combating the proliferation of small arms and light weapons in all states parties to the kinshasa convention by mobilizing adequate operational both institutional and logistical resources. the central african states intend to strengthen, among themselves and with other partners, including the united nations, cooperation, coordination, networking and the interoperability of resources for the effective implementation of the kinshasa convention to combat the illicit circulation of small arms and light weapons. cameroon knows that it can count on the support of the united nations and the secretary-general. with regard to the global economic situation, despite signs of recovery, growth in many regions remains below the levels needed for rapid progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals (sdgs). it is therefore necessary to increase the net international financial flows to developing countries, which have declined in recent years. however, we should not deceive ourselves honouring official development assistance commitments alone will not make it possible to meet all the funding needs for achieving the sdgs. the means of implementation set out in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the addis ababa action agenda of the third international conference on financing for development should, therefore, be fully mobilized at all levels. here i would emphasize the need to change the economic structure of most african economies, which focus economic activity on the extractive industries and the commodity-production sectors. owing to the limited impact of other sectors, such production patterns generate few jobs and promote inequality, while sowing the seeds of social unrest. the solution lies, therefore, in transforming the african economies, particularly through industrialization and economic diversification. it is therefore more appropriate than ever to provide more support to african countries in order to help them to reduce their debt burden, improve their production capacities and, lastly, help their products gain access to global markets under more favourable conditions. with regard to the specific case of international trade, africa still faces the threat of protectionism, to which, in our view, the most appropriate solution is the establishment of a universal multilateral trading system based on open, transparent, predictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and fair rules, in line with the sustainable development goals. cameroon is aware of its responsibilities in the current context. the challenge of achieving collective prosperity in my country means adopting ambitious and realistic development policies and programmes and instilling democratic values in our sociopolitical life, as well as including good governance and the fight against corruption on our priority agenda. on the economic front more specifically, my country has resolutely pursued the development of productive, structural and promising sectors, without which we cannot envisage improving the living conditions of the population. that is the objective of our long-term vision, whose goal, in line with the political agenda of president biya, is to make cameroon an emerging country by 2035. on the environmental front, my country, which was among the first states to ratify the paris agreement, remains firmly committed to preserving biodiversity. therefore, in order to protect the climatic balance of the planet, cameroon, a country in the congo basin and the second most forested country in africa, took the courageous decision not to make full use of its forests. in that regard, it is necessary to find urgent and appropriate solutions so as to reconcile the environmental protection initiatives adopted by cameroon in the interest of all and the legitimate aspirations of its people for their well-being. in the same vein, cameroon would like to reiterate the need for a number of urgent actions to preserve lake chad, which today has been reduced by more than 90 per cent of its initial surface area. it is an issue of survival for the local communities, whose livelihoods depend on preserving that body of water. cameroon would like to take this opportunity to express its sincere gratitude to the international donors that, in a spirit of solidarity, pledged a total of 1.5 billion for that cause at the donor conference held in early september. with regard to the democratic process in my country, we have improved our electoral system not only by strengthening electoral mechanisms but also through legislative and regulatory measures designed to ensure a high participation rate in upcoming electoral contests, the next being the presidential election scheduled for 7 october this year. the strengthening of democratic culture in cameroon is an inevitable process despite the security challenges that we face. thanks to the sacrifices of the entire cameroonian nation, combined with efforts coordinated with our neighbours in the lake chad basin and the support of our international partners, the capacity of the boko haram terrorist group to do harm has been significantly reduced, although it is necessary to remain mobilized until its complete eradication. regarding the sociopolitical situation in the north- west and south-west regions, our government remains determined to stabilize it. the corporatist demands of the teachers and lawyers unions, which are at the root of that situation, have continued to be the subject of negotiations with those socioprofessional categories. solutions, which have sometimes gone beyond the problems raised, have been found. unfortunately and cameroon wishes to state this from this rostrum individuals without faith or law thought it necessary to turn those socioprofessional concerns into secessionist demands aimed at breaking up the state, going outside constitutional and democratic mechanisms. having chosen as their modus operandi the perpetration of terrorist acts, armed gangs have burned schools and hospitals and violated childrens right to education by preventing them from going to school and by kidnapping and killing department officials, defence and security officers and indigenous authorities, as well as any citizen who does not subscribe to their destructive ideology. to date, nearly 100 members of the armed forces of our country have lost their lives without including the many families overwhelmed by those barbaric acts. the current situation has led to the deterioration of both the economic fabric and the school and health systems of those two regions. that picture is compounded by the fact that people have been displaced within the national territory and towards nigeria, a neighbouring friendly country. in the light of all this, our government is working to restore peace and security in both regions, with respect for human rights and the laws and regulations of the republic. in addition, sensitive to the plight of the populations concerned, the president of the republic, his excellency paul biya, decided to implement, on 21 june, an emergency humanitarian assistance plan for the people of the two regions with a provisional budget of cfa 12.7 billion. the funds allocated to the plan are being complemented by financing from a remarkable outpouring of solidarity and generosity from all other regions and segments of the cameroonian population. cameroon, a former trusteeship territory of the united nations, invites the assembly and all states and peoples who are friends of cameroon and who are committed to peace and justice to support it in mobilizing resources and implementing that humanitarian plan with a view to providing better assistance to those populations. the government would like to express its gratitude to our partners who, since the launch of that plan, have spontaneously given us their support. in any case, the government of cameroon would like to reaffirm its dedication to peace and stability and its resolve to take into account the concerns of the people. we have shown on several occasions, and we reiterate today, our openness to dialogue, but with strict respect for the institutions and laws of the republic. strong measures have already been taken to address the situation that i mentioned. i would like to note, for example, the creation of the national commission for the promotion of bilingualism and multiculturalism and a fully fledged ministry in charge of decentralization. the aim is to accelerate a shift towards the management of local affairs by the concerned populations themselves. the government of cameroon wishes to reiterate its unwavering commitment to ensuring the security of persons and property, as well as to protecting its national unity and integrity. in that regard, the government welcomes the rejection by the entire population of cameroon, and especially by the people of those two regions, of any attempt at secession. in conclusion, cameroon, a country whose independence was led and supervised by the united nations, would like to reaffirm in this hall not only its faith in our organization, but also its commitment to peace and stability, without which no development is possible.",Cameroon,Africa,77.0710372924805,3.030960083007813,2349.0,6.0,0.0,6.0,2.554278416347382
NGA,73,2018,"on behalf of the government and the people of nigeria, i congratulate ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces on her well-deserved election as president of the general assembly at its seventy-third session. as she embarks upon her assignment, i would like to assure her of nigerias support in no less measure than that which we extended to her predecessor, his excellency mr. miroslav lajcak. we appreciate his effective leadership of the general assembly at its seventy-second session, his dedication, commitment and the fairness with which he treated all member states. i also salute our secretary-general, his excellency mr. antonio guterres, who has steered the affairs of the secretariat with a focused commitment to the collective united nations pursuits of global peace and security, equity and justice, inclusiveness, womens empowerment and human rights. it is appropriate at this point to remember with deep sadness our late seventh secretary-general, mr. kofi annan, who passed away on the eve of his eighty-second birthday. kofi annans significant contributions to the work of the organization have been acknowledged in the well-deserved tributes that poured in from around the world following his death. we in africa, while mourning the loss of this great son of ours and citizen of the world, take pride in the way he served humankind in a truly exemplary manner. he demonstrated in his calm but determined manner the virtues of compassion, dedication to the cause of justice, fairness and human rights. he was a visionary leader who inspired hope, even in the face of the most daunting challenges. he devoted his entire lifes career to the united nations and the pursuit of its ideals and goals. the world is indeed a better place thanks to his exemplary service. during the past year, the world saw some positive results and encouraging signs from the bilateral and multilateral efforts of the international community in addressing conflicts, crises and threats to world peace. we particularly commend the efforts of the leaders of the united states, north korea and south korea in making headway towards our shared goal of a nuclear-free korean peninsula. in that connection, we acknowledge the commitment to peace shown by president donald trump and chairman kim jong un by initiating a historic summit. we urge them to continue that positive engagement. regrettably, many of the crises and threats to peace and security around the world, on which we debated last year and several previous years, remain unresolved. in some cases, matters have deteriorated. the continuing plight of the rohingyas in myanmar, the protracted israeli-palestinian conflict, the wars in yemen and syria and the fight against international and local terrorism, such as boko haram and al-shabaab, come to mind. the terrorist insurgencies that we face, particularly in the sahel and the lake chad basin, are partly fuelled by local factors and dynamics, but now increasingly by the international jihadi movement, runaway fighters from iraq and syria and arms from the disintegration of libya. fortunately, the carnage appears to have somewhat abated in myanmar. we commend the united nations for staying focused on the situation of the rohingya people in order to bring their suffering to an end and hold to account the perpetrators of the atrocious crimes committed against innocent and vulnerable members of that community, including women, children and the elderly. the international community should strengthen its resolve to combat ethnic and religious cleansing everywhere. we support the united nations efforts in ensuring that the rohingya refugees are allowed to return to their homes in myanmar with security, protection and a guarantee of citizenship. we note the indication by the government of myanmar of its willingness to address those issues, and we encourage it to do so expeditiously. in that context, nigeria commends the government and the people of bangladesh in particular, and all other countries and organizations that have contributed to shouldering the burden of providing shelter and other vital assistance to the rohingya refugees. the carnage and the worsening humanitarian situations in syria and yemen continue unabated. but the international community cannot afford to give up on the syrian and yemeni peoples. we must pursue all efforts to find peaceful negotiated political solutions to those wars, which cannot be won by the force of arms alone. regarding syria, we hope that the united nations-sponsored geneva process and the sochi initiative, led by russia, iran, and turkey, can advance that objective. the international community must keep up the pressure to encourage the parties to pursue the path of dialogue, negotiations and inclusiveness in resolving their sectarian divides and bringing to an end the immense human suffering in syria, as well as in yemen. we commend turkey, jordan, greece, germany, italy and france for hosting the millions of the refugees fleeing those brutal conflicts. the situation in the middle east, as grave as it has always been, is now worsened by developments since we last met (see a/72/pv.3). nigeria continues to call on the israelis and the palestinians to make the necessary compromises in the interests of justice, peace and security, in line with numerous united nations resolutions and applicable international law. unilateral, arbitrary and insensitive actions only prolong the conflict and undermine world peace and security. the deteriorating humanitarian situation in gaza is an appalling result of the unrestrained use of power. we urge both parties to re-engage in dialogue on the basis of the relevant united nations resolutions, the madrid principles, the quartet road map and the arab peace initiative, among others. nigeria reaffirms its unwavering support for a just two-state solution, negotiated without intimidation and with israel and palestine existing side-by-side in peace and security. the crises in the middle east have deep roots and have remained unresolved for too long. yet we should not fall into self-defeating despair and conclude that they are not amenable to solution. we should draw inspiration from the remarkable leadership that motivated ethiopia and eritrea to restore long-lost hope for peace between them, a remarkable show of statesmanship that has now galvanized neighbouring countries, including djibouti and somalia, to push for peace in the subregion. i believe that with hard work, commitment and a disposition to compromise and make the necessary sacrifices, peace is achievable in the middle east as well. most crises usually have a variety of festering causes and effects. it is the failure to address them early and effectively that lead to out-of-control conflicts. addressing them includes national and international collective actions that have a positive impact on peoples and communities. therefore, making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, which is the theme for this years general assembly, is very apt indeed. a topical consequence of the current conflicts around the world is the irregular migration of affected people from the middle east, afghanistan and africa to europe. irregular migration entails huge avoidable loss of human lives, puts strains on services in host countries and communities and fuels anti-immigrant and racist sentiments in europe. that is why we welcome the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the first-ever global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. we look forward to its adoption in marrakech later this year. the aim is to protect the rights of migrants worldwide while addressing the concerns of countries of origin, transit and destination alike. migration is a constant in human affairs. we in africa are grateful to countries that treat migrants with compassion and humanity, notably germany, italy and france. irregular migration is not a consequence of conflicts alone, but of the effects of climate change and the lack of opportunities at home. climate change remains one of the greatest challenges of our time. very close to us at home, it is our lot in nigeria, together with our neighbours around the lake chad basin, to live with the climate change consequences of a drastically shrunken lake chad and the parching up of otherwise fertile arable lands. lake chad was a major source of livelihood for the more than 45 million inhabitants of the region. its shrinking has meant the loss of such livelihoods, and the regions inhabitants have been impoverished and made vulnerable to the activities of extremists and terrorist groups. the instability caused in the subregion has intensified internal displacements, leading, among other consequences, to intense economic competition, especially between farmers and herdsmen. that is why we continue to call for dedicated international engagement to accelerate recovery efforts in the lake chad basin to address the root causes of the conflicts in the region. what is required is continuous and robust united nations cooperation with national governments and subregional and regional organizations, such as the lake chad basin commission, the economic community of west african states and the african union, to enhance capacity in conflict prevention, conflict management and peacebuilding. with regard to the lake chad basin plight, i extend our heartfelt appreciation to the united nations, the governments of germany, norway, the united states, sweden, the united kingdom and france and a host of other development partners for their laudable support in assisting us in addressing both the humanitarian challenges and the ongoing stabilization drive in the region. corruption within countries and the illicit flow of funds across national boundaries have a huge negative impact on the stability, peace and economic prospects of millions in developing countries. corruption significantly deprives national governments of resources to provide meaningful livelihoods for their populations, who are predominantly young people, thereby giving rise to more irregular migration. the fight against corruption therefore involves us all. it is in our collective interest to cooperate in tracking illicit financial flows, investigate and prosecute corrupt individuals and entities and repatriate such funds to their countries of origin. fighting corruption and resolving international conflicts, crises and wars; defeating terrorism and piracy; curbing arms trafficking and the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, which fuel such conflicts, in particular in africa; stemming irregular migration by addressing its root causes; and the many other global challenges we are faced with today can be effectively addressed only through multilateral cooperation and concerted action. the only global institutional framework we have to address those challenges is the united nations system. that is why we continue to call for the strengthening of the organization to make it more effective by speeding up the pace of progress towards its reform, including that of its principal organ, the security council. the reconstitution of the council to make it more equitable and more representative of our global community is both a political and moral imperative. we believe that a reformed security council, with expanded membership in both the permanent and non-permanent categories, is in accord with prevailing international consensus and it is in our collective interest to do so. it is high time we stop skirting around the issue and establish achievable benchmarks and time frames for such reforms. i assure all members that in such advocacy i am only reflecting nigerias deep and abiding commitment to our organization and its founding principles and goals. from the day we joined in 1960, we have contributed our quota to the fulfilment of the mandate of the united nations. we have been active participants in many security council- and african union-authorized peacekeeping operations around the world, beginning with the democratic republic of the congo in 1960. furthermore, nigeria has always mobilized the required human and material resources to achieve certain united nations goals, including the recently adopted 2030 agenda for sustainable development. we are resolute in complementing the efforts and examples of the united nations to promote gender equality and youth empowerment as necessary pillars for sustainable development. without such efforts there can be neither enduring peace nor security. as we craft and implement our national policies to achieve the goals set, we, in the spirit of international solidarity, will readily cooperate with other nations seeking to achieve similar goals for their own populations to help ensure that no one is left behind.",Nigeria,Africa,62.0160102844238,0.4199984937961266,1996.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.002004008016032
UGA,73,2018,"i congratulate ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces on her election as president of the general assembly at its seventy-third session and assure her of ugandas full support. we are confident that she will lead the assembly effectively and successfully. i would also like to express our gratitude to mr. miroslav lajcak for his leadership at the seventy-second session. i also pay tribute to the secretary-general, mr. antonio guterres, for his personal dedication and commitment to the work of the united nations. the theme for the seventy-third session making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibility for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies is very pertinent. three years ago, in this hall, we adopted the universal and transformative 2030 agenda for sustainable development (resolution 70/1), to guide our efforts over the next 15 years. at the heart of the 2030 agenda was a pledge to leave no one behind. that meant that the 17 sustainable development goals (sdgs) and their targets should be met for everyone, with a particular focus on the poorest, most vulnerable and furthest behind people who are indeed often left out. we in uganda have devoted a reasonable amount of time and resources to follow through on the implementation of the 2030 agenda and establish links between the sdgs and our national priorities. we are working deliberately to ensure that the sdgs are implemented in an effective and timely manner for the socioeconomic transformation and improvement of our peoples livelihoods. to do so, we have integrated 76 per cent of the sdgs into our national development plan for the period 2015-2020, as part of the uganda vision 2040. from our engagements so far, it is evident that the biggest challenge remains the obtaining of adequate financing to implement the 2030 agenda an issue that arose clearly in the high-level political forum held in new york in june. we in uganda are doing our best to mobilize resources, both domestic and external, to implement the sdgs. we are committed to leveraging support into productive areas, including the private sector, which has the potential to boost our economy and thereby contribute additional internally-generated resources to help implement the sdgs. we call upon development partners to fulfil their commitments and extend their support in terms of timely and adequate means for the implementation of the sdgs, as well as to prioritize the special needs of the most vulnerable countries and strengthen partnerships with them. our development and transformation cannot take place without peace and security, which are prerequisites for socioeconomic transformation. we should devote our attention to supporting an environment that is peaceful, thereby enabling us to concentrate on growth and development. today, challenges transcend borders, and no country alone can carry the weight of the world on its shoulders. we must redouble our collective efforts to seek common solutions to pressing regional and global challenges, including conflicts in various parts of the world, transnational organized crime, terrorism and violent extremism. we must be unwavering in our resolve to combat terrorism, religious extremism and terrorism from groups such as al-shabaab, boko haram, the islamic state in iraq and the levant and al-qaida, which constitute threats to our common security and development. that threat is compounded today, given the possibility of linkages between terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. those challenges cut across national boundaries and require collective responses. uganda remains committed to multilateralism as a means of achieving comprehensive and equitable solutions to global problems and challenges. in order to respond successfully to global crises, threats and challenges, the international community needs an efficient multilateral system. it is for that reason that uganda has continued to advance the cause for a revitalized, reformed and effective united nations system. that is critical if we are to make the united nations more responsive, more efficient and more effective in its support for member states efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals. uganda supports the comprehensive reform of the security council, and our approach is consistent with the african continents common position, as enunciated in the ezulwini consensus. first, african issues dominate the security council agenda, and therefore the vast majority of decisions made by the security council affect african countries. secondly, over the past few years, africa has shown its commitment to conflict prevention, mediation and resolution, as demonstrated by its leadership and response to conflict situations that have developed in the continent over the past few years. we believe that for a continent with 54 countries, a population of more than 1 billion people and demonstrable political commitment, africa should have a greater voice in the global political debate, which would increase the legitimacy of the decisions of the security council and foster its effectiveness. it is essential that the council membership, in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories, be equitable and reflect todays geopolitical realities. we therefore support the efforts of member states to move the intergovernmental negotiations process on security council reform forward, and we call for a constructive spirit aimed at realizing the long-awaited reform. strengthening south-south cooperation is critical to the achievement of the sustainable development goals. over the 40 years of its existence, south- south cooperation has proved to be a valuable avenue for building capacity and promoting development in developing countries. it has also facilitated cooperation, as manifested in south-south and triangular cooperation. it is our desire that we expand the scope of south-south cooperation to include, among other elements, trade, investment, infrastructure, tourism, peacebuilding and other areas of mutual interest. we look forward to the forthcoming united nations ministerial conference on south-south cooperation, which is to be held in buenos aires and which, we hope, will devote time to considering how to strengthen and further revitalize such cooperation within the context of a global partnership for sustainable development. the united nations has the primary responsibility for international peace and security. however, in undertaking that role, it is essential that the organization support initiatives undertaken by regional and subregional organizations. that partnership should be based on the division of labour, burden-sharing and complementarity, as well as mutual respect. in africa, the evidence is that, where such cooperation has taken place, the results have been positive. one example is the cooperation between the united nations and the african union on the situation in somalia, where the african union mission in somalia (amisom) has supported the efforts of the somali government to stabilize the country. uganda has played an active role in those regional initiatives. since amisoms deployment 11 years ago, we have witnessed tremendous progress in somalia. the somali government, previously based outside the country, has been based in mogadishu since 2007. international organizations, including the united nations and diplomatic missions, have also relocated to mogadishu. more than 80 per cent of the areas dominated by al-shabaab have been liberated. the area of piracy and the threat that piracy had caused at sea, threatening international shipping and trade, has been neutralized. business is thriving, and there are numerous reconstruction activities in many parts of the country. incidentally, regular elections have also been held. those positive developments and somalias relative stability would hardly have been possible without the contribution and sacrifice of amisom and the somali security forces. uganda appreciates the support that the african union and international partners have given to amisom, which was never intended to be in somalia forever. that is why it is essential that somalia be supported in providing security for its people. it is crucial that any reduction in the number of amisom troops correspond with the strengthening of the somali security forces. the failure to carefully manage that process could imperil the political and security gains already made in somalia. on south sudan, uganda has actively participated in the peace process launched in june 2017 and led by intergovernmental authority on development. we welcome the recently signed and revitalized agreement on the resolution of the conflict in the republic of south sudan. the agreement outlines guidelines on power sharing, governance and security arrangements, including the settling of boundary disputes, which will be guided by a boundary commission. we call on the international community to support the implementation of the agreement. climate change remains a major challenge and a threat to our efforts to achieve sustainable development. uganda supported the efforts to reach the new, universally binding paris agreement on climate change, reached in december 2015. uganda was one of the first countries to sign and ratify the agreement last year. we must continue to muster the political will necessary to fully implement the agreement. there is a need for the enhanced delivery of finance to the most vulnerable countries to support their climate-change mitigation and adaptation measures. as highlighted in the 2030 agenda, we can be the first generation to succeed in ending poverty, just as we may be the last generation to have a chance of saving the planet. let all of us commit ourselves to preventing wars and to promoting peace. let us build new international relations. let us reduce inequalities. let us ensure that no one is left behind. and let us support the primary role of the united nations as the principal organization for addressing global challenges. the adoption of the 2030 agenda coincided with the onset of what would become ugandas single largest refugee influx in its history. as a country, we now host 1.4 million refugees, which is the largest number on the african continent and ranks quite high at the global level. the presence of large numbers of refugees, mostly arriving unexpectedly and quickly, amplifies the existing vulnerability of host communities. it also places a huge demand on already over-stretched national capacities and resources. uganda remains committed to maintaining and promoting asylum space and its refugee model, consistent with the 2016 new york declaration for refugees and migrants. we do that because we know that no one chooses to be a refugee. we also understand the critical importance of treating refugees humanely, decently and with dignity. we remain committed to working with national, regional and international actors to address the drivers of displacement and refugees. we are grateful for the solidarity and support that the international community has extended to uganda thus far. it is our expectation that the new global compact on refugees will provide the much needed predictable and equitable burden- and responsibility-sharing among all member states. lastly, uganda remains ready to work with the secretary-general and all member states to realize a united nations that is more inclusive, effective and responsive to the needs of the peoples of the world.",Uganda,Africa,76.5274963378906,2.130520105361938,1768.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,2.2624434389140275
BFA,74,2019,"as africas candidate for the position of president of the general assembly at its seventy-fourth session, mr. tijjani muhammad-bande was elected on 4 june (see a/73/ pv.87), and it gives me great pleasure to extend my heartfelt and brotherly congratulations, as well as those of my delegation. he has held high office in his country, nigeria, and has a perfect knowledge of the united nations. i wish him every success and assure him of burkina fasos full support as he fulfils his mandate. history will remember the outgoing president, ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces, as the fourth woman the second in half a century to be elected president of the general assembly in the seventy-four years that our organization has existed. in view of the outstanding work she did and the results she achieved, i wish to congratulate her on having undertaken the major challenges related to the theme of the seventy- third session. allow me to reaffirm the gratitude and appreciation of the people of burkina faso to the secretary-general for his personal commitment and support, as well as that of the united nations system, to my country in difficult times. this is an opportunity to renew my encouragement for the courageous implementation of the reforms undertaken and to congratulate him on his report presented to the security council on 24 july on the activities of the united nations office for west africa and the sahel (s/2019/549). the statement made by the president of the security council during that briefing bodes well for the future (see s/pv.8585). this years seventy-fourth session is being held under the theme galvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion. burkina faso welcomes the choice of theme, its relevance and its timeliness because, now more than ever, multilateralism remains the only way for my country to find solutions to the major problems faced by the world. those challenges must include the fight against terrorism and violent extremism, organized crime and cybercrime, which no country, no matter how powerful, can vanquish alone. in view of all the achievements made by the united nations in the areas of peacekeeping, security, justice, human rights, development and the fight against climate change, with the paris agreement on climate change, it is imperative that we work to strengthen multilateralism and the role of the united nations as a means of achieving common solutions to our planets problems. terrorism and poverty are the most devastating phenomena that our world faces today. since january 2016, our country has been confronted with persistent and unprecedented terrorist attacks, with far-reaching human, social and economic consequences. the escalation of violence and insecurity has led to a major humanitarian crisis, resulting in numerous casualties among civilians and defence and security forces alike; hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons; schools and health facilities shut down; and state symbols destroyed. destabilization continues through the instrumentalization of latent problems between communities that develop into violent clashes. in terms of public finances, we can see an increase in security spending at the expense of funding for development and social sectors. i would like to take this opportunity to welcome the support of the united nations in the face of the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in burkina faso. burkina fasos eligibility for the peacebuilding fund, as announced by the secretary- general, has made it possible following an inter-agency mission led by the special representative of the secretary-general for west africa and the sahel and an emergency task force under the leadership of the assistant secretary-general to open one of the five united nations regional centres outside the capital, so as to be closer to the population in these difficult times. to ensure that support from international partners is well coordinated and aligned with an agreed comprehensive and integrated strategy that links prevention, emergency aid, rehabilitation and development, the government requested an assessment mission regarding prevention and peacebuilding to be conducted by the african development bank, the european union and the world bank. the assessment took place from 1 to 10 july and its recommendations are being implemented. eliminating poverty is the first of the sustainable development goals because, according to the united nations, millions of people are living below the poverty line. if that trend is not reversed, more than 168 million children will be living in extreme poverty. more than ever, the international community must intensify its efforts in the fight to eradicate poverty, which is a sine qua non for sustainable and inclusive development. the fight will have an impact only if we effectively coordinate multifaceted actions within the framework of the third united nations decade for the eradication of poverty 2018-2027 and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. the security situation in the area covered by the group of five for the sahel (g-5 sahel) remains a source of concern. beyond burkina faso, and in my capacity as current chair of the g-5 sahel, i would like to remind the international community of the importance of supporting the g-5 sahel countries in their determined fight against terrorism and to foster development. the activity of armed terrorist groups is expanding geographically, both within our countries and outside the g-5 sahel area, which clearly demonstrates the urgent need to take appropriate measures and initiatives. in that regard, the accra initiative and the economic community of west african states (ecowas) extraordinary summit on terrorism, held on 14 september, should be commended. those initiatives serve to indicate clearly that terrorism needs to be fought at the regional level. at this stage, i am delighted that the appeal of the g-5 sahel, with the staunch support of the secretary- general, was received favourably by the security council with the adoption of resolution 2480 (2019), to renew the mandate of the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali (minusma). through that resolution, minusma will provide support to all battalions operating under the joint force of the g-5 sahel, on the condition that the g-5 sahel or other partners will assume responsibility for the delivery of aid to operations beyond malian territory. at the ecowas extraordinary summit on terrorism in ouagadougou, heads of state noted the ineffectiveness of minusma in dealing with terrorism in mali because of the limits of the mandate conferred upon it by the security council. it would seem inconceivable that, with 12,000 men and substantial resources, the join force is unable to contribute effectively to the fight against terrorism in the country. that is why, alongside my ecowas peers and in my capacity as current chair of the g-5 sahel, i call for a more robust and more offensive mandate for minusma. such a mandate would make it possible to secure and stabilize mali and all other countries of the g-5 sahel. likewise, we call on the security council to confer a mandate under chapter vii of the charter of the united nations to the joint force of the g-5 sahel in order to provide it with perennial resources. at the group of seven summit in biarritz, we proposed, along with germany and france, the establishment of an international partnership for stability and security in the sahel that includes addressing the issues of terrorism and the need for development. i would like to call upon all partners to join that initiative unreservedly, as peace and stability in the sahel also mean peace and stability in africa and the rest of the world. i would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the gratitude of the governments and the peoples of my country as well as the countries of the g-5 sahel to the entire united nations system and all our partners for their support and guidance ever since the beginning of the security and humanitarian crisis. i reiterate my appeal for bilateral and international solidarity to provide the joint force of the g-5 sahel with the predictable and sustainable equipment and financial resources necessary for its proper functioning in order to promote our national and regional development programmes through the priority investment programme. the two pillars security and development are necessary to guarantee the stability of the region. in the same vein, the countries of the g-5 sahel adopted, on 13 september, the desert to power initiative, together with the african development bank, which aims to harness solar energy and provide electricity to more than 60 million people by 2030, as well as to create jobs and provide access to water, agriculture, education and health care. despite the prevailing situation in my country, my government is continuing to implement its development programme in order to meet the basic needs of our people, strengthen democracy and consolidate the rule of law. bolstering economic recovery, fighting unemployment, empowering women and youth, creating initiatives for vulnerable people and promoting good governance are at the core of our efforts. moreover, in the context of the fight against social inequality, as well as to ensure the harmonious development of the entire country, burkina faso has implemented two instruments to reduce regional disparities and to galvanize local economies through a local economic development support programme and the emergency programme for the sahel, which has now been extended to the five regions affected by violent extremism. in terms of democratic governance, i invited the majority party and the opposition to partake in a political dialogue from 15 to 22 july. the dialogue was positive and has allowed us to make progress that should be consolidated by the adoption of relevant regulatory and legislative texts. turning to the fight against climate change, i would first of all like to applaud yesterdays climate action summit, the format of which made it possible to put forward concrete proposals. i would also like to commend the success of the conference of the parties to the united nations convention to combat desertification held in india just a few days ago, and to recall the clear link between desertification and climate change. the countries of the sahel understand that well, having created the permanent inter-state committee for drought control in the sahel in 1973. climate change is causing population displacement in burkina faso and exacerbating conflicts between herders and farmers due to water shortages and the scarcity of arable and grazing land. that is why, in the context of preventing and combating the impacts of climate change, my government has taken important initiatives, including a five-year reforestation plan, a law to reduce the effects of disasters and humanitarian crises and a national plan for risk reduction and emergency preparedness for the period 2016 to 2020. despite the difficult security situation, burkina faso has continued to fulfil its international obligations by supporting fraternal nations restore peace through united nations missions. for example, as one of the major troop contributors to peacekeeping missions, burkina faso is present in both mali and darfur. in guinea-bissau, our troops are involved in the ecowas mission in guinea-bissau, which has contributed to providing a certain level of stability to that friendly country, allowing a president of the republic to finish their term for the first time. we are also undertaking to increase womens contribution as part of gender mainstreaming efforts in united nations peacekeeping operations. as we meet today, the international news is marked by tensions and threats to international peace and security. if we are all present at each new session of the general assembly, it is because we believe in the capacity of the united nations a symbol par excellence of multilateralism and diplomacy to find lasting solutions to the major challenges and various crises that affect us in many parts of the world. i would like to recall that the ongoing security crisis in the g-5 sahel space is a direct result of the destruction of the libyan state. i urge the international community to mobilize in order to find a solution for lasting peace in that country, because resolving the security crisis in our countries is heavily dependent upon peace in libya. in that connection, burkina faso welcomes united nations mediation and strongly recommends the involvement of the african union in the hope that such joint efforts will lead to the resolution of the libyan crisis. in keeping with the shared views of the g-5 sahel and the outcome of the ecowas extraordinary summit in ouagadougou, i call on the security council to appoint a joint united nations-african union special envoy with a profound understanding of the situation in libya. on the question of western sahara, burkina faso reiterates its support for the political process under way, conducted under the exclusive auspices of the secretary-general with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable and negotiated political solution to the dispute, as has been recommended by the council since 2007, including in resolution 2468 (2019), adopted in april. burkina faso also welcomes the holding of two round tables among algeria, morocco, mauritania and the polisario front, in accordance with security council resolutions 2414 (2018) and 2440 (2018). i would like to take this opportunity to commend the work carried out by the former special envoy of the secretary- general of the united nations during his tenure. given the regional dimension of the dispute, burkina faso calls on all states in the region to contribute to the political process and step up their participation in the negotiation process. in the middle east, the question of palestinian remains a major concern in the israeli-palestinian conflict, and burkina faso reiterates its support for the two-state solution, with israel and palestine living in peace and good-neighbourliness. burkina faso strongly condemns the repeated attacks against saudi arabia and its oil facilities. whatever their origin, these attacks constitute serious threats to peace in saudi arabia and the region as a whole. we therefore firmly call for these acts of hostility to end. with regard to the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed on cuba by the united states of america, burkina faso believes that it should be lifted, in the light of the great prejudices the cuban people have suffered for many years. international peace and security are under threat from the arms race. that is why burkina faso supports all multilateral initiatives and actions aimed at achieving disarmament on both weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons. today there is ever-more evidence that the proliferation of small arms and light weapons poses a threat to international peace and security in various parts of the world, especially west africa and the sahel, and hinders the achievement of the sustainable development goals. i urge states to allocate the resources freed up by disarmament to financing the sustainable development goals (sdgs), official development assistance and the green climate fund. in so doing, we can offer better prospects to millions of disadvantaged people. yesterday we held the climate action summit and the high-level meeting on universal health coverage, and in the coming days we will hold high-level meetings on sustainable development and financing for development. we express our hope that all these initiatives will help generate political momentum and support at all levels to strengthen engagement with the private sector in order to leverage innovative solutions for financing the sdgs. in this regard, we commend the secretary-generals launch yesterday, 23 september, of the global investors for sustainable development alliance. this group, which will comprise 25 to 30 chief executive officers of major companies from around the world, is intended to leverage their know-how to boost long-term investment in sustainable development; as such, it is a beacon of hope at a moment when funding is ever scarcer. burkina faso, like all countries, is keenly following the intergovernmental negotiations on security council reform, as well as issues relating to the revitalization of the general assembly and partnerships with the regional and subregional organizations. regarding the reform, as we prepare to mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of our organization under the theme the future we want, the united nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism, burkina faso continues to hope that the negotiations, launched more than 20 years ago, will deliver the reform we all so wish to see reform that makes the security council more representative of the 193 states members of the united nations across both categories of membership and with all corresponding privileges and obligations. i take this opportunity to reaffirm burkina fasos full adherence to the common african position as reflected in the ezulwini consensus and the sirte declaration. in marking 24 april 2019 as the first international day of multilateralism and diplomacy for peace, the united nations reaffirmed the importance of multilateralism and showed that it is together that we can tackle and overcome the global challenges of the modern world.",Burkina Faso,Africa,29.6632804870605,5.456156325202511,2779.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,1.7992083483267363
TGO,74,2019,"at the outset, i would like to congratulate you, sir, on your election as president of the general assembly at its seventy-fourth session. while assuring you, sir, of my countrys full support, i wish you every success in implementing the priorities of your mandate. i also wish to take this opportunity to thank your predecessor, ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces, for her excellent work and the progress achieved by our organization during her term in office. on behalf of the togolese people, i would also like to reiterate my deep gratitude to secretary-general antonio guterres for his unwavering commitment to peace and security in a world facing multifaceted forms of upheaval. multilateralism and the pooling of efforts and experiences are appearing today no longer as mere options available to the community of states but rather as imperatives indispensable to the attainment of our objectives. today, our organizations responsibilities are growing in number, and its multidimensional challenges are becoming more complex. in order to ensure more effective action, we must get used to the idea that there is no alternative to collective action and solidarity. evidently, the scale and acuteness of these new challenges which are fuelled and perpetuated by wars, sociopolitical crises, poverty, exclusion, environmental degradation and the effects of climate change call on us to wake up and implement concrete, concerted and pragmatic actions. that is why i commend the theme chosen for this session of the general assembly galvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion as it responds perfectly to our current concerns and reflects the values that underpin our full adherence to the charter of the united nations. by adopting the 2030 agenda for sustainable development a number of years ago, we resolutely committed to ensuring that this programme, which remains to date the most ambitious tool we have to advance the well-being of our peoples, does not become merely another programme. in this regard, i wish to reiterate togos full support for all initiatives and mechanisms aimed at implementing various strategic plans in pursuit of achieving the sustainable development goals (sdgs). the government of togo has made enormous efforts at the national level to reduce poverty and ensure that no one is left behind by 2030. with this in mind, and in accordance with the 2030 agenda, agenda 2063 of the african union and vision 2020 of the economic community of west african states (ecowas), my country adopted a national development plan for the period 2018-2022, in line with the countrys emerging agenda. the plan is a five-year strategic document based on the fundamentals of economic, social and environmental development. through the plans three strategic focuses, togo aspires to become a stable and economically, socially and democratically sound middle-income country that espouses solidarity and is open to the world. this is already reflected in efforts to establish a strategic hub of excellence and a first-class business centre in the west african subregion and to develop centres to transform agriculture, manufacturing and the extractive industry while strengthening social development and inclusion mechanisms. in short, the plan, whose flagship project is based on rational choices that integrate all 17 sdgs, is designed to make structural transformations to the togolese economy with the aim of ensuring strong, sustainable, resilient and inclusive growth that creates decent jobs for all and leads to improved individual well-being. therefore, in addition to the accelerated building of road, port, airport and agricultural infrastructure, my country is determinedly pursuing its 2008 education policy to introduce free primary education, the implementation of an expanded school meals programme and the introduction of health insurance called school assur for 2 million students. the policy has encouraged greater enrolment, especially among girls. through the government education strategy for the period 2014-2025, togo aims to achieve universal primary education by 2022 and to expand preschool services in rural and poor areas. the ultimate objective is to meet the standards of quality education and significantly reduce the illiteracy. when we adopted the sdgs in 2015, we knew full well that the fulfilment of our development commitments would depend on the international communitys ability to mobilize the necessary financing. accordingly, it is vital to further promote international cooperation and solidarity in order to establish innovative partnerships that will bring progress at the international level. we therefore welcome the addis ababa action agenda of the third international conference on financing for development, which remains a key framework for mobilizing financial resources likely to lead to tangible progress in achieving the sdgs. it is therefore urgent to make a definitive commitment to the implementation of the addis ababa action agenda and to make the most of the relevant mechanisms it offers. in this regard, particular attention should be paid to the least developed countries and to all vulnerable countries at the margins of world trade. we should seize multilateralism as an opportunity for vibrant international economic and trade cooperation that brings hope to the human community we are building. i would like to welcome the continuous integration efforts made within the framework of the african union (au) and the continents regional communities since the adoption of agenda 2063 of the african union, whose goal is the structural transformation in africa. in this regard, my country welcomes the aus launch, on 30 may, in niamey, of the african continental free trade area, one of the 14 flagship projects of agenda 2063, which is intended to accelerate the industrialization of africa, increase intra-african trade and build quality infrastructure. similarly, the single african air transport market was established in response to the urgent need to unify the african domestic air-transport market. the market, of which togo is the coordinator, will stimulate huge cross-border investment opportunities in the aviation and tourism industries and provides an excellent opportunity to improve connectivity among au member states. at the subregional level, the adoption of the principle of a common ecowas currency is also to be welcomed as an important factor in accelerating integration. in addition to improving the legal framework to promote good governance and access to health, education and well-being, the issue of climate change and environmental protection is a major concern for my country. it is the entire international communitys responsibility to demonstrate how closely the issue of climate change is linked to food and health security, poverty reduction, economic growth and human development. we therefore believe that it is appropriate to guarantee funds to help the most vulnerable countries preserve biodiversity. that is why it is crucial for the international community to find appropriate solutions to issues related to climate change. at this juncture, my country reiterates its support and commitment to the paris agreement. accordingly, the holding of the climate action summit, which took place in the run-up to the general debate, is to be welcomed. we hope that the promises made at the summit will lead to a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 and their total neutralization by 2050. my country stresses the need to better endow the green climate fund so that it can better assist less polluting states that are more exposed to climate change in finding the appropriate means to deal with it. our world today is in an extremely volatile security context. the persistence of hotbeds of tension, particularly in africa, the middle east and the near east, such emerging issues as terrorism, violent extremism, natural disasters and climate change, and the trends towards nuclear proliferation threaten international peace and security, without which our development efforts cannot prosper. that is why, my country, which is committed to the values of peace and peaceful coexistence, considers that we have everything to gain by acting in a concerted manner and with strong determination to end all these crises. the year 2019 has been a particularly scary year for several countries marked by an existential fear of terrorist threats. recurring attacks around the world prove to us on a daily basis that this rampant evil remains omnipresent, forcing us to be constantly and increasingly vigilant. the west african region has not been spared. indeed, there have been several attacks in mali, the niger, nigeria, burkina faso, benin and so on. because of its proximity to neighbouring countries hard hit by the scourge of terrorism, togo is well aware of the magnitude of the threat and remains on high alert in the face of this asymmetrical threat. togo is currently taking a preventive and proactive approach to the terrorist threat and has therefore sought the expertise of the office of counter-terrorism to help it assess the risks posed by violent extremism. the offices visit, which took place in lome from 22 to 24 july, made it possible to make recommendations and assess the priority needs in terms of technical assistance. i take this opportunity to thank the united nations for its highly appreciated support. my country remains convinced that the spread of the scourge of terrorism requires enhanced international cooperation as its complexity precludes an individual approach by states and demands a synergistic action through a shared vision. aware of the need for cooperation at the regional level, the togolese government supports the accra initiative, taken jointly with benin, burkina faso, cote divoire, ghana, mali and the niger in september 2017, whose objective is precisely to unify and harmonize approaches to the terrorist threat. to that end, it is vital that sustainable financing be found for the group of five for the sahel, which constitutes an exemplary framework for cooperation in the fight against terrorism in the west african subregion. the delay in the operationalization of its joint force is highly detrimental to peace and security in africa. in this regard, we join in the many calls for international mobilization to enable the force to act and contribute to eradicating this tentacular evil that preys on our countries. that is why my country welcomes the reform of the united nations peace and security pillar and strongly supports the actions initiated by the secretary-general to increase the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations through more specific mandates and collaboration with regional and subregional organizations. however, it is not unreasonable to question the diminishing financial resources allocated to these operations as the challenges of peacekeeping and consolidation become more complex. as a major troop contributor to peacekeeping operations, togo reiterates its commitment to serve wherever peace is threatened. we fully support both the zero-tolerance policy on sexual abuse in theatres of peacekeeping operations and the kigali principles. it cannot be stressed enough that nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction continue to pose serious threats to international peace and security. my country, whose foreign policy prioritizes general and complete disarmament, has always advocated the use of nuclear energy exclusively for civilian purposes. it is in this spirit that, on 7 august, the togolese government adopted a bill on the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear energy, cognizant of its positive applications, particularly in the fields of health, agriculture, industry and ionizing radiation, and so on. international migratory flows are intensifying and diversifying and today constitute another major challenge to be addressed. as a result of growing economic inequality, more men and women are leaving their countries of origin in search of a safer or better life and opportunities in other places. the migratory phenomenon too often results in tragedy and is a source of sorrow for people and governments alike. it poses enormous challenges to the international community, which must find mechanisms for collective management and more effective cooperation among states. in this regard, my delegation welcomes the adoption by the general assembly on 19 december 2018 of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which emerged from the intergovernmental conference held in marrakech on 10 and 11 december 2018. this historic compact, while non-legally binding, serves as a useful road map for the more effective management of this great crisis of our time. our community of shared destiny compels us to overcome any temptation to resort to isolated and solitary actions. if our goal is to effectively fight against poverty and all the other ills afflicting humankind in order to build fairer and more inclusive societies, we must devote our efforts to strengthening multilateral mechanisms, while taking daily inspiration from the african proverb: alone we go faster, but together we go further.",Togo,Africa,66.5370788574219,4.201641966268824,2053.0,12.0,0.0,12.0,5.845104724792986
ZAF,74,2019,"i stand here deeply moved at the coincidence that i should speak following my counterpart, the foreign minister of botswana, given that my grandfather, z. k. matthews, stood here in 1966 as the first ambassador of the newly independent botswana. i represent the president cyril ramaphosa of south africa as i stand here today. i wish on behalf of south africa to congratulate you, sir, on your leadership of the general assembly at its seventy-fourth session. we are pleased to see a leader from our sister country nigeria preside over the assembly at its seventy-fourth session. i assure you of south africas full support as you implement your priorities and responsibilities during your term in office. we thoroughly welcome the theme that you have chosen. it is indeed timely and relevant, especially given the complex challenges facing the world today. far too many of the worlds population remain poor, jobless and hopeless. it is imperative that we intensify efforts directed at fundamentally changing their lives. this debate holds special significance for south africa as it coincides with the twenty-fifth anniversary of south africas freedom and democracy. our anniversary is due in large measure to the solidarity we enjoyed from most states members of the united nations, and it is because of this history that south africa is also vested in the ideal of a robust and coherent united nations as it is this organization that has the ability to ensure that all who yearn for freedom achieve it. we know from our experience and history that it will only be through the determined efforts of the united nations family that freedom for the people of palestine can be achieved and only through the united nations family that the sahrawi people can enjoy freedom. as early as 1946, shortly after the creation of the united nations, the issue of apartheid south africas discriminatory policies was included as an item on the agenda of the first session of the general assembly. it was therefore with no great surprise that a democratic south africa eagerly pursued its new international role and enthusiastically took up its responsibilities as an active member of the united nations. we have sought to participate in all aspects of the united nations, including by serving in its principal organs. the principles that motivate our action derive from a firm belief in multilateralism, especially a global governance system that is fair, equitable and representative; the promotion of peace and security through global disarmament, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the promotion of good governance; the promotion of human rights; and the fight against poverty through the promotion of sustainable development. we strongly believe that a purposive system of multilateralism is necessary to deal with the global challenges we confront us. we are all interdependent in an ever more globalized world, and we can ill afford the pursuit of narrow self-interests. today, south africa is able to partner with the united nations in addressing the injustice and imbalances that are a legacy of our past. as government and civil society in south africa, we respect and act on the decisions of the united nations. this includes actions in response to the sustainable development goals (sdgs), which articulate a transformative global development agenda. south africas national development plan 2030 is the policy we have adopted to execute our commitment to achieving the sdgs. our plan complements our efforts to support peace, development and security on our continent and the aspirations contained in agenda 2063 of the african union (au). we believe that, in order to achieve these goals, all member states should establish partnerships, primarily with the private sector and civil society organizations, to ensure a joint commitment aimed at realizing a world free of poverty and underdevelopment. one of the greatest obstacles to building a world free of poverty and inequality is intolerance. this includes intolerance of other nations and intolerance of our fellow human beings, as well as inadequate care for the natural environment that sustains us all. intolerance is exhibited most gruesomely by the evidence of gender-based violence and the exclusion of women from many sectors in society. our country, south africa, is taking urgent steps to address the scars of gender-based violence. all of us need to act urgently to ensure that we all enjoy full access to our human rights and that all our citizens, in particular, women, enjoy bodily security. we also face an existential threat due to our intolerance and the disrespect and veritable violence we inflict on the planet on which we all depend. the organization, however, is a manifestation of the rejection of intolerance. it was created in the aftermath of a devastating world war as a global forum where nations of the world can address differences and work together for the common good of all people. our annual gathering here in the assembly hall should provide us an opportunity to recommit to these important values. i firmly believe that we are all here because we are committed to the ideal of multilateral solutions to the worlds problems, which draws on strength through diversity diversity of perspective born from differences in upbringing and culture. by being here, therefore, we recognize that we need each other and that we need to work together. we must therefore use this opportunity to rally against intolerance of any kind so that nations can live in peace and respect each other irrespective of nationality, religion, ethnic or social origin, gender or any other status. it is through our differences that we should find strength and not division. unfortunately, our country, south africa, has not been immune from evidence of intolerance and division in some parts of our nation. the incidents of violence and looting that erupted in parts of gauteng and kwazulu-natal provinces were regrettable and shameful for a nation with such a proud history of struggle and international solidarity and support. the government of south africa strongly condemned these tragic actions and is working hard to ensure we address the security lapses and intolerance that led to the violence. we are working tirelessly to tackle crime and lawlessness and to ensure that the arrested criminals face the full might of the law. we are also committed to addressing the inadequacy of our immigration administration in order to curb illegal migration and to make sure that everyone who comes to south africa is documented and safe. we plan to work with all countries of the continent to ensure that we implement our development strategies and use them to create greater economic opportunities for all our people so as to diminish feelings of resentment and antipathy. working with civil society, we will build bridges allowing all who live in south africa to reach out to each other in order to build bonds of friendship and pan-africanism. i am pleased that i can honestly confirm to this important global body that south africa has an unwavering commitment to our continent, africa. we have made dedicated efforts to contribute positively in support of peace and development on our continent, and we will continue those efforts even as we work to address the inadequacies i have referred to. our country, south africa, has enjoyed democracy for 25 years, and in that time the leaders and the people of south africa have consistently acknowledged the immeasurable contribution that the people of africa rendered in support of the struggle against apartheid. our neighbouring states in particular, and the rest of the countries of africa made great sacrifices in support of the liberation movements and the oppressed citizens of south africa. we wish to reiterate that south africa does not condone any form of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia or related intolerance. in fact, south africa has embraced millions of migrants and refugees from all over the continent of africa, and the majority of our people have warmly embraced their brothers and sisters from the continent. we are determined to ensure that it becomes a national embrace and is not a limited to some communities. it is an honour for us to address the general assembly in the first year of the nelson mandela decade of peace, which the assembly last year agreed would run from 2019 to 2028. the decade calls on us to intensify our efforts to pursue international peace and security, development and human rights. south africa therefore commits to use the nelson mandela decade of peace to promote the strengthening of multilateralism and diplomacy as effective tools for addressing the challenges facing the world today. we cannot decisively deal with the threats of poverty unless we transform the current structure of the global economy, which continues to perpetuate divisions between the global north and global south. while a few enjoy the benefits of globalization, the majority of the people of the world have not reaped those benefits. it is necessary for us all to work together and spare no effort in addressing the challenges brought by the impact of globalization and the untransformed structure of global economy. the issues of global peace and security continue to be one of our foremost priorities within the united nations family. in that regard, we welcome the united nations efforts to address the plethora of challenges to peace and security that serve as a major obstacle to our efforts of the development of the continent. we are currently serving as a member of the security council. the theme for our term is continuing the legacy: working for a just and peaceful world. that is the embodiment of the legacy of nelson mandela and furthers the objective of silencing the guns on the african continent by 2020. we are using our tenure to promote the maintenance of international peace and security and advocate for the peaceful settlement of disputes and inclusive dialogue. we continue to encourage closer cooperation between the security council and other regional and subregional organizations, particularly our african union. we further emphasize the role of women in the resolution of conflict. we argue for a gender perspective to be mainstreamed into all security council resolutions, in line with security council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, which was adopted at the initiative of our neighbour namibia. despite the commitments in the resolution, women remain excluded from peace processes, including in the drafting of peace agreements, and their involvement in united nations peacekeeping is limited. we need to ensure that women are fully part of peacebuilding processes and form a part of the institutions that are established once conflict has been eradicated. in october, we will preside over the security councils debate on that subject. the emphasis of the debate should be to ensure the implementation of the commitments that we have made to fully implementing the women and peace and security agenda. as we have consistently stated, south africa is supportive of this global institution and a rules-based multilateral system, but we believe that the united nations remains hamstrung by the fact that it continues to have structures that are undemocratic and anachronistic. we remain gravely concerned that 74 years after the founding of the united nations, key decisions on peace and security are the de facto domain of only five countries. twenty years of discussions on reform of the security council have yielded no movement towards a more representative and inclusive body. we believe that the time has come for the broader membership to heed the overwhelming call for africa to obtain at least two permanent seats, with all the prerogatives of permanent membership, as well as five non-permanent seats, as embodied in the common african position, adopted in the ezulwini consensus. in that regard, we must see an invigoration of the negotiations on reform at the intergovernmental negotiations, including by ensuring that we move to text-based negotiations. our continent africa has reached an important milestone with the adoption and launch of the african continental free trade area agreement. the agreement entered into force on 30 may, and we are confident that it will unleash africas economic potential and consolidate its position as a new frontier of economic growth and development. it is a flagship imitative of the au agenda 2063, and the trade opportunities it creates must be taken up by all member states and our partners. we are ready to engage in active deliberations on that bold step. we wish to stress that africas development cannot be addressed without responding to illicit financial flows. we believe that those debilitate our efforts to generate sufficient domestic resources to support our development. we propose that we work together as the international community to establish an intergovernmental framework that would have a universal political mandate, which would serve as a basis to address those illicit flows, including speeding up the return of assets. the international community stands at a unique crossroads where the shifting international order has the ability to shape international peace and security for decades to come. it is therefore a great disappointment that we witnessed the demise of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty in august. furthermore, in the prevailing international climate, successes in the field of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, are few and far between. the threats posed by those weapons are too great for the international community to ignore. we believe that only the complete, transparent, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of such weapons and their means of delivery can prevent their use in an escalating conflict. we feel ashamed by the fact that for over 70 years, the people of palestine have lived under occupation. in the past year, that occupation has worsened, with continued illegal settlement activity and further insecurity for the peoples of palestine and israel. as the international community, we must continue to urge for a negotiated settlement to that long-standing conflict. the united nations must remain seized by the issue of western sahara, for the benefit of its people and africas aspirations to a truly free africa, with no country under colonial and imperial control. we also reiterate our steadfast solidarity with the government and people of cuba, while condemning the continuation of unilateral sanctions against cuba and zimbabwe. i wish to conclude by affirming that south africa stands ready to work with all member states to promote the united nations and its objectives of promoting international peace and security, development and human rights enjoyed by all, so that finally we can reach a point when all our people enjoy freedom, development and democracy.",South

ZMB,75,2020,"your excellency mr. volkan bozkir, president of the 75th session of the united nations general assembly; the secretary-general of the united nations, antonio guterres; distinguished heads of states and governments; honourable ministers; heads of intergovernmental and other organisations; excellencies; distinguished ladies and gentlemen. let me join the previous speakers in congratulating your excellency mr. volkan bozkir on the assumption of the presidency of the 75th regular session of the united nations general assembly. i am optimistic that your excellencys wealth of knowledge and experience as a diplomat and parliamentarian will indeed serve us well during the 75th session. i wish to also extend zambias sincere appreciation to his excellency prof. tijjani muhammad-bande for his able leadership during the 74th session. mr. president, the theme for this session, the future we want, the united nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism-confronting covid-19 through effective multilateral action presents us an opportunity to evaluate the existing multilateral approaches to address the challenges affecting our peoples. the covid-19 pandemic has not only decimated economies and exacerbated poverty, but it has also shown us how interconnected and interdependent our world is, and how we must work together to respond effectively to these challenges that confront us today. under these circumstances, an opportunity has manifested itself on the need to maximise our comparative advantages, as well as share expertise, innovations and indigenous knowledge to be utilised for the betterment of our peoples livelihoods. i remain confident that with concerted efforts and unity of purpose, together we can conquer this pandemic on a global scale. the post-coronavirus landscape will require urgent action to guarantee recovery and to lay a solid foundation for a better world. accordingly, zambia supports the calls for major interventions such as: (i) debt relief and or cancellation for developing member states; (ii) enhanced collaboration in research for the vaccination and cure of covid-19; and (iii) mobilisation of resources from the local and international community. mr. president, prior to the onset of covid-19, young people were already three times more likely to be unemployed compared to their adult counterparts. as the pandemic pushes the global economy into a deeper crisis, the young generation is once again at risk to disproportionately bear the brunt of mass unemployment and under-protection. in this regard, i wish to share that the zambian government launched a multi sectoral youth empowerment programme to support the young entrepreneurs. the multi-sectoral approach has helped ensure that programmes and activities to empower and create employment opportunities for the youth are mainstreamed across all sectors. mr. president, in 2015, we the members of the un pledged to leave no one behind and shift world onto a path of sustainable development prosperity for all. this commitment is indeed still alive to most of us. although the road before us is laden with challenges, we should neither waiver, nor surrender to any cynicism on the accelerated implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. for its part, the government of the republic of zambia, working closely with the and other key stakeholders such as the private sector and civil societies developed the national sdgs coordination framework to guide the implementation, monitoring and reporting on sdgs and integrated it into the countrys national development plan. mr. president, zambia remains supportive of international efforts aimed at the peaceful resolution of conflicts through advocacy and support shown for peacekeeping missions. zambia remains an active player in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations in the region. in this regard, we would like to urge the united nations to remain resolute in its duty of protecting these vulnerable persons, and to redouble its efforts to bring about a more peaceful world. this is the bedrock of the un foundation, as espoused by its charter. mr. president, as we mark the 75th anniversary of this, our great institution, we cannot but conclude that, the united nations importance and continued relevance to mankind is beyond question. it is in this context that we need to revitalize it so that it can fulfil the ideals for which it was established. i thank you.",Zambia,Africa,87.5,3.943741005617121,679.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.945508100147275
GHA,75,2020,"mr president, secretary general, a year ago, we were all looking forward to what, we were sure, would be the grand celebrations at this years general assembly to mark the 75th anniversary of the united nations. instead of the anticipated major gathering for the celebrations, we have been forced to stay at home, and employ technology to make our addresses to the assembly. it is not only these celebrations that have had to be adapted to changed circumstances; our world has been turned upside down, and we have all been forced to learn new ways of doing things. it would have been implausible to suggest, but we have learnt not to shake hands or hug our loved ones. for many people, the most difficult thing to deal with in these uncertain and unsettling times has been the silence forced on churches, mosques, temples and other places of worship. singing in groups has become a dangerous activity, and a major item which is preoccupying the attention of world leaders is how to send and keep our children in school safely. all the sacred economic rules by which we have been urged to conduct our affairs in the past century have been thrown out, at least for the moment. indeed, all our best laid plans have turned out to be of no use, when faced with the ravages of an unknown virus. we, in ghana, have, however, chalked modest successes in trying to defeat the virus through resolute actions by my government, the cooperation of the ghanaian people, and the grace of the almighty. mr president, the lessons are clear: we all fell together and looked into the abyss together. even as we closed our borders and shut airports, the reality dawned on all of us that we had to rely on each other to be able to get out of the trouble we were in. we have all gone down together, we should all rise together. if the answer to this pandemic lies in finding a vaccine, that vaccine should be made available to the whole world, rich and poor alike, developed and developing, all races and all beliefs. the virus has taught us that we are all at risk, and there is no special protection for the rich or a particular class. for as long as the virus exists, whatever medical solutions that might be found should be made available for all in aid of our common humanity. we are told by the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) that covid-19 has brought in its wake a significant reduction in the financing available to developing economies, again, with the organisation estimating that external private finance inflows to developing economies could drop by $700 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 levels, exceeding the immediate impact of the 2008 global financial crisis by 60 per cent. the restructuring of the global financing architecture, to enable access to fresh capital by developing nations, now more than ever, is of immediate necessity, if the gains chalked in transforming their economies are not to be eroded, and the standards of living of their peoples are not to be dangerously lowered. now is the time for this much discussed and much analysed institution of ours, the united nations, to rise to the occasion. one of its agencies, the who, has been in the eye of the storm during this crisis, and all of us have to learn the lessons that have emerged. yes, we should have arguments about the un and its agencies and their roles, but, after 75 years, the arguments should be like the ones we have in our families, and not about their very existence. we should correct the longstanding injustice that the current structure and composition of the un, particularly the security council, represents for the nations of africa. established in those far-off days of 1945, membership of the council does not presently reflect the realities of the 21st century. the time has come for the adoption and endorsement of africas common position on un reform, as set out in the ezulwini consensus, so we can create a modern united nations fit for purpose in our time. we should also focus our attention on the 2030 un sustainable development goals, especially as we mark the beginning of the decade of action to deliver the goals and targets of agenda 2030. mr president, as co-chair of the sdg group of eminent advocates, ghana believes that the effective implementation of the 17 sdgs remains critical to making the multilateral system relevant in addressing the global challenges we face. indeed, one such is the threat to the consolidation of democratic governance, especially in africa, in the face of turbulent conditions prevailing in several parts of africa. as the newly-elected chairperson of the economic community of west african states (ecowas), i say that one immediate test confronting the community is the political situation in mali, following the coup detat that ousted president ibrahim boubacar keita, which has been compounded further by the activities of terrorists and violent extremists, who are in control of large swathes of that country and some parts of the sahel region. we have learnt, most often through bitter experience, that terrorism and violent extremism are not restricted to particular geographic locations or jurisdictions, as the impact of a single terrorist incident in one part of the world resonates throughout the world. it is incumbent on the un and, indeed, all member states to lend their support to the efforts being made by ecowas to restore normalcy to mali, and help us defeat the scourge of terrorism. mr. president, the importance of technology has been reinforced in the time of the pandemic. virtual meetings are now part of our normal lives, young people have graduated in virtual ceremonies, and we might never go back to some of the many conferences that we used to attend, and it is obvious that technology is the future. ghana, therefore, welcomes and endorses the secretary-generals recommendation, as contained in the roadmap on digital cooperation, to ensure that no one is left behind. how else would we all have maintained a semblance of keeping in touch in the past six months, but for technology? the political season is at its height here in ghana, as we prepare for presidential and parliamentary elections in december. like everything else in our world today, even the politicking has been affected by the pandemic, and we cannot campaign for votes in the style to which we are accustomed. we are having to rely on technology to find ways of popularising our messages in the time of covid-19. it is a matter of great pride to me that, in spite of the difficulties in conducting an election during a pandemic, i am able to state that all ghanaians are agreed that we have to work together to ensure that the elections will be transparent, free, fair, safe and credible. this will be the eighth election since we embarked on constitutional rule in our fourth republic in 1992. each of the elections has seen an improvement on the previous one, and we are looking forward to this years passing off peacefully, with characteristic ghanaian dignity. we are keenly aware of the reputation that ghana has built as a tolerant and working democracy, and we have every intention to nurture and improve upon it. paramount in everyones consideration is the ghana project, which aims to modernise all aspects of our lives, and bring prosperity to our land. i have no doubts whatsoever that, at the end of the elections, we shall be proud of ourselves, africa will have good cause to be proud of us, and the rest of the world will find lessons to learn from us. last year, 2019, was an extraordinarily exciting year for us in ghana. it marked the 400th anniversary of the start of the barbaric trans-atlantic slave trade, and the arrival in america of the first captured slaves from west africa. to mark this tragic anniversary, we declared 2019 the year of return, and extended a welcome back to the african continent of the descendants of the slaves who constitute the bulk of the black population in the americas and the caribbean. the invitation was enthusiastically taken up, and a great time was had by all. we have every intention to keep a welcome mat laid out in ghana for members of the african diaspora. we, in ghana, live with the grim reality that the majority of the abducted slaves from the continent were transported to the americas and caribbean through the forts dotted along our coastline. we owe it to their descendants to find a safe haven in ghana, if they should need it. this responsibility means we have to make ghana secure and desirable both for her present-day citizens and for those in the diaspora that might want to come back either for a visit or stay. i extend the best of luck to you all from ghana, and look forward to a healthy and happy world. i thank you for your attention.",Ghana,Africa,80.379997253418,3.409159913517251,1517.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.977587343441002
SWZ,75,2020,"mr. president, your excellencies, heads of state and government mr. secretary-general distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, mr. president, i am honoured to address the 75th session of the united nations general assembly. i congratulate you, your excellency, following your appointment as president of this session. i also express my appreciation to your predecessor for his outstanding work and contribution to the success of the 74th session. mr. president, as we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the united nations, it is only proper that we reflect on who we are, where we come from and where we are going. the united nations has stood for the lofty ideal of building an international system of collaboration and common purpose. this system allows us to collectively call to account those who choose conflict over peace, it recognizes the dignity and equal worth of all people. it values each and every one of us and the input that we make towards that end. though we have been faced with multiple challenges, as a collective, we have pressed forward, slowly, steadily, to forge an agreed system of rules and norms that are better, stronger, transparent and more consistent than ever before. it has resulted in an international order that has overseen unparalleled advances in human liberty, the attainment of dignity amongst peoples, given rise to prosperity and a global economy that has sought to uplift more than a billion people from poverty. yet we come together in reflection here, knowing that our work is far from complete, acknowledging that the spirit of cooperation that has held us bound, is faced with its greatest challenge thus far. it is for this reason therefore that we welcome this years theme, the future we want, the united nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism confronting covid-19 through effective multilateral action. this years theme, rightly challenges us to critically self-examine. the 75th session of the united nations general assembly, must be a year when we come together to discuss our priorities as a human family, and how we can build a better future for all. it is a reminder to the united nations to revisit and stick to the ideal that recognizes dignity, prioritizes the value of cooperation and the equal worth of all, leaving no one behind. mr. president, earlier this year, the united nations held a commemoration of the signing of the charter of the united nations, presenting an opportunity for us all to reflect on the relevance of the charter today, and recommit to those goals and principles laid down therein. the kingdom of eswatini welcomed the hosting of the event and joined others in sharing our thoughts related to that initial signing and the developments that have occurred between then and now. further, we cast our sights forward to imagine the potential challenges that could arise for us to deal with. what remained as an absolute fact for us, was that, whatever challenges had come before, whatever strife we are facing today and whatever incidents as may lay in wait for us, we deal with it best, when we deal with it together. mr. president, there is a common acceptance that multilateralism and diplomacy underpin the advancement of the three pillars of the united nations, namely, sustainable development, peace and security and human rights, which are interlinked and mutually reinforcing, while observing respective specific mandates and the charter of the united nations. however, we still must recognize the inconsistencies in our collective behavior. many of our countries continue to live in poverty amid great natural wealth. in many instances, national interests continue to impede resolution of crises. the challenge of migrant flows requires a collective approach. if we continue to seek solutions in an individual manner, this will result in an impasse. this organization has become more necessary than ever to foster the kind of collective action to todays global challenges. mr. president, the kingdom of eswatini, like the rest of the world, has had to deal with the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. for us, this came at a time when the kingdom was faced with multiple battles against the scourges of hiv, malaria and tuberculosis, all of which had placed a huge strain on our resources. as a relatively small economy, we did not boast huge reserves with which to finance the fight against the new onslaught. we welcomed the recently held high-level event on financing for development in the era of covid-19 and beyond. global challenges and crises have a tendency of either pulling us together or pushing us apart; true to form, the covid-19 crisis has created an unprecedented bond between and among countries. the crisis has taught and reminded us that we belong together, irrespective of location, distance and time on this planet. this is the time in history where our reflection and focus must be candid and transformational to deeply explore the lessons we have learnt and therefore, rethink generational to shape the future we want. therefore, this is the opportune time to ask big questions, make great decisions and commit and act in solidarity. mr. president, the intensity of the crisis has demonstrated glaring socio-economic gaps within and between countries. it has better defined and exposed our uniqueness in financial and human resource endowment and our strength, capacity and ability to cope with challenges. the pandemic underscored that our individual strength is weak without collective but differential commitment and solidarity. it has reiterated and re-emphasized that we are living in a global village and therefore, we need each other. we can conclude that, without collective commitment to multilateralism, we will never accomplish the ideals of the decade of action and delivery and pinnacle of the 2030 agenda to leave no one behind. our community of nations must accept the reality that the crisis has forever changed our way of life; and we must resist the temptation of reverting back to what we knew as normal, but our duty is to prepare for a new normal. opportunity beckons as the pandemic revealed that what we considered as normal has been shown to have lacked the ability to deliver on many socio-economic needs. therefore, our focus should entail both response to the crisis but more so, shaping our future in the face of other possible crises. the most successful preparedness and response plans must incorporate strategies that strengthen our nations beyond recovery. relevant strategies will mark the birth of a new society that will present the future we want. there is no easy and isolated way to fix the present and prepare for the future, except through collective commitment to multilateralism. the united nations is not only an international body, but it is a family of nations, therefore, it will always be at the center of and a catalyst to multilateralism and support the future we want, and in extension, the united nations we need. mr. president, at this juncture, let me commend the president of the general assembly, secretary general and staff of the united nations, the international financial institutions, developing partners and everyone for the quick response and reaction to mitigate the impact of the pandemic in the midst of implementation of the 2030 agenda and sustainable goals. many countries have benefitted and this has not gone unnoticed. as the world committed in rio de janeiro in 2012, this is the opportune time to reiterate and recommit to sustainable development and promotion of an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable future for our planet and for present and future generations. making the united nations work for us all, calls for collective commitment at individual, communal, national, regional and global levels. the pandemic has also demonstrated the weakness in the classification of our development levels, which have jeopardized many countries opportunities to access development finance and debt restructuring, among others. it has further revealed the need to revise and extend countries success and development beyond traditional measurements of gross national income, but fully consider their vulnerability, particularly in crises such as we are experiencing. every countrys needs must be considered in isolation, but tackled in the multilateral context. this will help us collectively commit to bottom- up multilateralism and help us collectively progress to the future we want and the united nations we need. as a united nation, we must dissuade any tensions between nations that have been created by the play out of the pandemic. every public and private institution must be ready to promote international cooperation, get better prepared to deal with future global threats and commit to multilateralism. covid-19 has generated a strong global viewpoint where all people dread to think backward and inward but to think forward and outward, with the hope to create the world we want. achieving effective and all-benefiting multilateralism and building back better together calls for ensuring that no one is left behind. this will entail leveraging of existing innovative partnerships, coordinating responses, refraining from protectionist measures, strengthening inclusion, investing in technologies that will sustain economic and social sectors in the midst of crises, among others mr. president, we welcome the mandated events that are scheduled to be held on the margins of the general assembly this year, namely the twenty-fifth anniversary of the fourth world conference on women, the high-level meeting to commemorate and promote the international day for the total elimination of nuclear weapons and the summit on biodiversity. we trust that these events shall be a success. mr. president, as intimated earlier, 2020 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the fourth world conference on women and the adoption of the beijing declaration and platform for action. this is a significant year for the accelerated realization of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. nonetheless, it is lamentable that though the global community celebrates the twenty-fifth anniversary of the fourth world conference on women, no country has achieved full gender equality. poverty, violence against women and girls, the relentless pushback against womens rights and gender equality remain prevalent across the world. we believe that this anniversary is the appropriate occasion to give new momentum to action. we encourage governments, civil society and other stakeholders to assess gains, identify gaps and challenges, and critically set priorities for this generation and future generations. with all the challenges the world is facing, it has never been more important to advance the elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, than it is now. we need renewed political will to deliver on the commitments made. let us all recommit ourselves to our common goal of achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and their enjoyment of human rights, everywhere. in this regard, it pleases me to note that the government of the kingdom of eswatini has adopted numerous pro-gender policies that promote gender equality. female representation in positions of power and decision-making compare favorably within our region. mr. president, as we evaluate the current status of our organization, we must reflect on the ongoing process of reforms. this process, is, in itself, a tacit admission on our part that change needs to happen to ensure the continued relevance of the un and its subsidiary bodies. the time that has elapsed since the discussions began, is a cause for concern. however, we believe that this year gives us the moral imperative to push for accelerated progress in those reforms. we support ongoing discussions within the framework of the ad hoc working on the revitalization of the work of the un general assembly (ahwg) that seeks to find mechanisms to enhance the role and efficiency of the general assembly. we recognize the work that has gone into streamlining the work of the economic and social council (ecosoc), in particular how it relates to the functions of the general assembly to enhance synergies and reduce overlaps between the two bodies. the reform of the security council is a key aspect of the process and no transformation could be complete without its fundamental reform. to this end, the kingdom of eswatini wishes to reiterate africas call for permanent membership to the security council in accordance with the ezulwini consensus. mr. president, as we conclude, among the political issues that have continued to fester for too long is the continued denial of the right of the people of taiwan to participate in the un system. taiwan has shown significant commitment to the ideals of the united nations and has aligned her priorities with those of the organization. taiwan has, further, committed significant resources to the attainment of the sustainable development goals, not only within her own boundaries, but going so far as to assist other countries to do the same. earlier we reflected upon those who have assisted the kingdom of eswatini in our fight against the covid-19 pandemic, taiwan deserves a special mention in that regard. in these uncertain times, where resources are dwindling, taiwan has not only expressed commitment towards collaborative global citizenship, but has shown manifest support to development initiatives undertaken by some of our countries and, in particular, the kingdom of eswatini. in this globally interdependent world, it is crucial that we work together where we can and constructively counsel each other where appropriate. the united nations is home to these interactions and in this role, retains the unmitigated support of the kingdom of eswatini. i thank you and may the almighty god bless you.",Eswatini,Africa,89.2799987792969,5.325462701228032,2232.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.7921146953405018
CAF,75,2020,"president of the united nations general assembly, excellencies heads of state and government, secretary-general of the united nations, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, although at a virtual event, i am again honoured to address our august assembly, on behalf of the central african republic, on the occasion of the seventy- fifth session of the united nations general assembly. i would like to extend to you, president volkan bozkir, my warm and heartfelt congratulations on your election as president of the seventy-fifth session of the united nations general assembly. your election is a well-deserved honour and tribute paid to all continents and, in particular, to your country, the republic of turkey. we believe that your perfect knowledge of the international landscape, as well as your outstanding personal attributes are an asset and will ensure the success of our work. i would also like to acknowledge the excellent work and the results achieved by professor tijjani muhammad-bande during the seventy-fourth session. we acknowledge his efforts and convey our recognition and satisfaction. mr. president, from this rostrum, on behalf of the people and the government of the central african republic, i would also like to take this opportunity to convey our gratitude for the kind attention that my country, the central african republic, receives from the international community, despite your many commitments and requests. allow me to reiterate all our gratitude to and confidence in mr. antonio guterres, secretary-general of the united nations, for his sustained commitment to global peace and development, and, in particular, for his constant and multifaceted support to the central african republic. mr. president, this years assembly is being held amid special circumstances, as humankind, as a whole, faces the regrettable covid-19 pandemic, which has claimed several lives throughout the world. we pay tribute to the memory of all those across the world who succumbed to this pandemic, which humankind combats daily and collectively. since the start of this health crisis, the central african republic, as other countries in the world, has not been spared. our assessment of the socioeconomic impact of covid-19 indicates that my countrys economy is expected to contract between 0.8 per cent and 1.2 per cent. i therefore call on the entire international community to make a greater investment in the quest for common measures and solutions to eradicate this health crisis. mr. president, in light of the many challenges facing humankind related to security, the environment, climate change, human mobility, human rights, terrorism, denuclearization, the dismantling of weapons of mass destruction and the covid-19 pandemic, the choice of this years theme the future we want, the un we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism reaffirms that multilateralism has always been and remains the instrument to effectively combat certain scourges and the means to minimize certain antagonisms at the international level. on the occasion of this seventy-fifth anniversary, it is essential to recall the purposes and principles that govern our great organization through our commitments contained in the charter of the united nations, namely to prevent and remove threats to peace; to develop friendly relations among nations; to fight against inequality and all forms of discrimination; and to protect human rights. the present session is also an opportunity to reflect on how our common organization will be able to face the new challenges affecting the world and our societies. today, more than ever, we must, in spite of our differences, advocate for international cooperation and dialogue, joining our efforts for a better future for humankind. the united nations remains, and will continue to be, the multilateral framework par excellence. mr. president, no human endeavour is perfect, and therefore we must bear in mind the weaknesses identified over the past 75 years and find effective and lasting solutions to them. in that regard, the central african republic wishes to add its voice to the call of some states and the african union for security council reform. it is a matter of looking beyond narrow self-interests and giving priority to common interests, while avoiding confrontation, in favour of a joint strategy for our world, which is facing unprecedented changes and upheavals. it is also a matter of african representation in the organs of our shared organization, in particular the security council, which is the central decisionmaking body. through multilateralism, we can ensure a more secure and stable future for humankind, which aspires only to peace, justice and sustainable development for all. mr. president, i would also like to take this opportunity to share developments in the situation in my country. thanks to the combined efforts of the international community and under the auspices of the african union, the political agreement for peace and reconciliation in the central african republic was signed between the central african government and 14 armed groups on 6 february 2019. since the signing of the agreement, the central african government and the guarantors and facilitators of the agreement have spared no effort to implement and respect the commitments contained therein. in addition, the government has made a great deal of progress in the area of security sector reform, which will facilitate the gradual redeployment of the defence and security forces and the continuation of the national ddrr programme, which has already been launched in preparation for the upcoming elections scheduled for the 2020-2021 period. despite the governments willingness to respect the commitments contained in the political agreement, massive violations of international humanitarian law and human rights continue to be perpetrated against the civilian population by certain armed groups that are signatories to the agreement. those groups are also continuing to rearm through illegal means, thereby undermining the peace and national reconciliation process, which is a guarantee of social cohesion. mr. president, notwithstanding the considerable progress made in the implementation of security sector reforms in the central african republic, many challenges are yet to be addressed, including the genuine commitment of armed groups to ddrr and the special joint security units; the sustained support of the international community in the implementation of the appr-rca; the conduct of operations and the means for operational engagement; and the mobilization of resources at the national level and from development partners. mr. president, in order to adhere to the constitutional deadline, the national electoral authority is working, despite the covid-19 pandemic, to ensure that the elections are held according to the established timeline. to date, the census and dismemberment operations are continuing outside the country and will be immediately followed by the publication of the electoral roll a condition for the convocation of the electorate for the first round of elections. the government is working closely with the organizational structure of the electoral assistance project (papec) 2019-2022, which is built around key coordination mechanisms. mr. president, the government, with the support of minusca, continues to make progress in the restoration of state authority throughout the national territory, the redeployment of defence and security forces and state services and the restoration of basic social services. the central african army is now steadily regaining its operational capacities and i can assure you of my determination to create the necessary conditions for the reconstruction of the central african republic in order to restore confidence and joie de vivre among central africans. to that end, i reiterate the appeal of the central african people to the security council to fully lift the arms embargo, the burden of which limits our national army in its role as a republican army, in order to ensure the true authority of the state and guarantee the integrity of our national territory. mr. president, before concluding my remarks, i would like to recall that my country continues to make efforts in the implementation of the national plan for recovery and peacebuilding (rcpca), which is evaluated regularly with our partners. while tangible progress has been made, much remains to be done. to that end, we are committed to preserving and consolidating the gains made, improving on our weaknesses and continuing to make progress in the search for peace and economic recovery. the task at hand is immense and, as the saying goes, the bird can only take flight when it is supported by the air. i therefore hope that the international community will remain mobilized in that spirit of international solidarity alongside the government and people of the central african republic in order to achieve my countrys recovery. i hope for great success in our work. long live multilateralism! long live international cooperation and solidarity! i thank you.",Central African Republic,Africa,37.4900016784668,2.144680611639768,1411.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.7087172218284905
SYC,75,2020,"your excellency, president of the 75th session of the united nations general assembly, your excellency, secretary-general of the united nations, distinguished heads of state and government, esteemed delegates, ladies and gentlemen, rarely have the united nations and multilateralism been tested as they are being tested during this year of the uns 75th anniversary, the year where the world is grappling with the covid-19 pandemic. rarely, has there been a more pressing time for creative thinking and innovation to respond to modern challenges. the painful lessons learned since the outbreak of the pandemic underscores the urgent need for continued collective approaches. to be effective, our joint efforts need to be coordinated and delivered through a revitalised and more inclusive multilateral system, comprising of the voices of all stakeholders, including the youth, civil society and the private sector to ensure a global all-of-society approach. i say revitalised because the existing set-up has, despite the lessons of past outbreaks of viruses, failed to respond adequately to covid-19 with devastating consequences. seychelles stepped up to the challenge despite being faced with an economy crippled by the collapse of tourism, our primary industry. we introduced a series of unprecedented measures to save the lives of our people and mitigate the economic destruction,minimising unemployment and securing workers incomes. to ensure an inclusive approach that factors in the specific needs of different stakeholders in seychelles, we consulted with the private sector, trade unions, civil society and inter-faith organisations as required. we were joined in this undertaking by the tourism businesses, a key driver of seychelles economy and who continue to play an instrumental role in drafting seychelles tourism comeback together with government. however, everything seychelles has done to date to minimise the impact of covid-19 will not be sustainable in the longterm because of the depletion in our foreign exchange reserves. it took us 44 years since seychelles independence to attain the quality of life we enjoyed before covid-19, and just 4 months for covid-19 to paralyse our tourism industry and with it much of our economy. we foresee a 14 per cent budgetary deficit for this year instead of the 4 per cent surplus we projected before covid-19. the seychelles economy was set to grow by 3.9 per cent this year but will now end 2020 at -15.2 per cent. we estimate it will take at least five years for seychelles to return to where we were before covid-19, assuming the world gets a vaccine that ensures the novel coronavirus is no longer a global public health threat. i turn to the multilateralism theme for this debate; a multilateralism which we recognise as crucial to a globally-coordinated response to covid-19 and to us emerging from the pandemic more resilient, and hopefully, more compassionate. sids have made heroic efforts to shore up jobs as unemployment grows and provide social safety nets for our people in response to covid-19 with the limited capacity and resources that we have. however, we cannot maintain these in the long term, often at the cost of worsening our debt burdens as part of a looming global debt crisis. the shortage of effective global solutions for sids as the united nations celebrates its 75th anniversary is alarming.the ultimate test of multilateralism lies in the way we assist vulnerable economies today, for it ultimately decides whether we attain the future we want. we call on all relevant stakeholders to take immediate, substantial and tailored actions to allow us to manage the crisis and address its grave socio-economic impacts while preserving our development achievements and reinforcing our resilience to future shocks. such actions should include building capacity for small island developing states to cope with and recover from external shocks such as pandemics like covid-19, other forms of disasters, and impacts of climate change. international financial institutions should re-examine their eligibility criteria to tailor sids access to concessional financing to take into account our extreme vulnerability to economic, climate and now public health shocks that put us at particular risk and disadvantage. seychelles backs aosis, the alliance of small island states, in its call for a sids compact, which caters for our specific and persistent constraints and vulnerabilities. such a compact will require the design of new, and enhancement of existing financial instruments to guide sids economies through the current crisis, create a responsive system where we maintain our gains, reinforce resilience to climate change and achieve sustainable development. the massive global economic restructuring now underway presents the world with a unique opportunity to pursue a holistic and transformational approach to address the numerous escalating global crises we face while making the most efficient use of our resources. our recovery efforts should aim to take us to a more sustainable and resilient future which requires a recognition that economic recovery depends on ecological health. reviving economic activity should not be at the expense of environmental sustainability. one of the jobs seychelles has offered workers made redundant by covid-19, for example, is the planting of hundreds of thousands of trees across our islands. this measure is in keeping with the call by the worlds scientists to protect our natural environment at all costs. this is how we can restore planetary health and the balance between human and ecological wellbeing. we cannot have a healthy recovery from the covid-19 pandemic if we do not heal our poor relationship with our natural environment. as the saying goes human health depends on natures health. we understand this well in seychelles where the two main pillars of our economy, tourism and fishing, depend on the state of our natural, and especially our ocean, environment. so, on march 26 this year as the pandemic raged across the world, seychelles went ahead and delivered on our 2012 rio+20 commitment to protect 30 per cent of our giant exclusive economic zone of 1.34 million square kilometres by 2020. it was a recognition that even while we dealt with a public health emergency, we cherished the importance of nature to our peoples physical, economic and social wellbeing. we should adopt a similar approach to climate action to maintain and increase climate ambition in the context of the pandemic and prevent a post-covid rebound in greenhouse gas emissions. while the effects of climate breakdown will continue to impact us long after weve dealt with the pandemic, covid-19 presents a new opportunity to take action on climate change as countries make drastic changes to infrastructure, jobs and investment. achieving the 1.5-degree celsius goal remains critical if we are to leave no country behind.the drop in greenhouse gas emissions and improvement in air quality during the pandemic is only temporary, and research shows it will have a negligible impact on the climate crisis. we do not know how long the covid-19 pandemic will last, but we know we are heading towards a temperature increase of approximately 3 degrees celsius if business continues as usual. this will have devastating consequences for us all, especially sids and other vulnerable countries. covid-19 is not the biggest global challenge of our time. climate change is the number one threat to humanity. the postponement of cop26 to november 2021 does not mean a postponement of climate action and of urgently-needed efforts to raise climate ambitions. seychelles updated nationally determined contribution (ndc) or climate pledge to the paris agreement will accordingly have a whole chapter on harnessing the ocean that surrounds our islands for nature-based climate action. seychelles ndc will champion blue carbon ecosystems such as mangroves and the vast expanses of seagrass meadows, which form part of our new marine protected areas. it will enable us as a big ocean state to contribute to the global fight against climate change far more than when we relied solely on land-based actions. seychelles protection of nearly a third of our eez for ocean conservation, sustainability and climate action shows that countries responses to the health and financial crisis caused by covid19 do not need to be at the expense of nature and climate. seychelles agrees that we need international solidarity and cooperation more than ever in the face of the worst human and economic crisis of our lifetime, a multilateralism that works for both developed and developing countries. many argue that society is unwilling to make the behavioural changes necessary to address climate change effectively. countries responses to covid-19 show otherwise; we have changed in previously unthinkable ways. we must not lose sight of the fact that the stimulus packages aimed at rescuing economies from the coronavirus crisis will determine the shape of the global economy a more financially stable, socially inclusive and low-carbon economy for years to come. if we are going to talk about a multilateralism that counts for everyone, it must deliver an equitable recovery that prioritises innovation, science, health, wellbeing, opportunity and a liveable environment for all countries and societies. the future of multilateralism depends on a transformative global response to the covid 19 pandemic. a transformation which will take us all, the most vulnerable countries and fragile economies included, into a more sustainable and resilient post-covid world better equipped to meet the goals of the 2030 agenda and the paris agreement on climate change, and for small island developing states. i thank you all.",Seychelles,Africa,96.1999969482422,4.187048370493156,1535.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.3029315960912053

todays world is markedly different from the one that existed when the un was founded. there have been significant improvements in our collective wellbeing. social and human development indicators have improved substantially. life expectancy increased, mortality and morbidity reduced, the number of member states almost quadrupled from 51 to 193 countries, including mozambique. efforts to empower women are now a deepening reality. the theme of this general assembly faithfully reflects the essence of the united nations and is a call for renewal of the vision for an integrated and cooperative world, where nations express themselves in an open manner and act in a coordinated way in promoting sustainable and inclusive development, taking the 2030 agenda as their banner. mozambique, therefore, upholds the assumptions of common but differentiated responsibility, as well as internationally agreed development goals, in the light of the paris declaration on the effectiveness of development aid. all this shows that multilateral cooperation remains the best approach to addressing the challenges and mitigating the suffering of the people who are the main reason for the creation of the united nations. multilateralism within the united nations is also key if we take into account that the world economy, especially that of developing countries, has been severely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, and its restoration requires global, integrated and concerted interventions. nationalism and isolationism in the face of a pandemic are, as far as we are concerned, a prescription for failure to respond to this and other infectious diseases of an unpredictable nature. other global phenomena and challenges calling for the united nations led multilateral intervention, include terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity, public health, research and development, trade and industrialization. in the global village in which we live, national and international issues are increasingly less discernible. the transnational nature and interconnection of these phenomena require leadership that recognises that, in todays world, our interventions must take into account the intrinsic relationship between the national, regional and global citizens. mr president, excellencies! mozambique welcomes and reiterates its support for the actions of the secretary general, aimed at reforming the united nations, in the areas of peace and security, peace operations, development and management of the organization. nevertheless, we are concerned about the lack of progress in the inter-governmental negotiations so that the reform of the security council will yield results in line with the 21st century. the reform has the merit of placing international peace, security and stability as catalysts for the global development agenda, as well as making the un more representative, efficient and transparent, based on the contemporary geopolitical situation, which will render the decisions of this body more effective and legitimate. so once again we call on the international community to take advantage of this historic moment of our universal organizations 75th anniversary to combine efforts to a sustainable solution to outstanding security issues. mr president, excellencies! the agenda 2030 and the sustainable development goals are instruments that fuel the hope of billions of people around the world in achieving the long-awaited progress and well-being of all peoples. in this context, mozambique submitted in july 2020 its first voluntary national report on the sustainable development goals, which shares achievements based on the aspirations of the mozambican people, in compliance with this international instrument reflected in our five-year government programme 2020-2024. the future we want lies in the actions of the present; the united nations we need depend on our posture and responsible action, today and tomorrow. only with a collective approach and humanism, we will successfully implement the agenda of inclusiveness that we have chosen of leaving no one behind. it is in this context that the government of mozambique promotes peacebuilding, the preservation of human rights, social justice, gender equality and equity, the inclusion of young people and people with disabilities in development programmes, cementing the unity and sharing of benefits, which is salient feature of our governance. with regard to climate change, due to its geographical location, mozambique has been cyclically affected by extreme events. every year, the country has suffered cyclones, floods and droughts and memories of cyclones idai and kenneth in march and april 2019 are still fresh. more than a year later, we continue efforts to rebuild and recover socioeconomic damage, combined with adaptation and resilience measures, in the light of internationally accepted practices under the paris agreement on climate change to which we have been a party since june 2018. we take this opportunity to reiterate our gratitude to the international community for the support provided during and after the cyclones. mozambique continues to promote sustainable management of biodiversity and ecosystems and natural resources, with the purpose of adding value to the integrated local development of communities. in this regard, the promotion of conservation areas, in national territory, continues to deserve our special attention. on the other hand, we have sought to expand access to electricity for domestic and industrial consumption, through clean and renewable sources, whether it is thermoelectric power, natural gas powered plants, wind and solar power, in addition to hydropower, in order to ensure the achievement of the universal access target by 2030. at present, all 154 district headquarters are connected to the national power grid, and the electrification programme for administrative posts is underway. recognising the role of agriculture to this end, the government decided to allocate 10 per cent of its annual budget to this sector for the first time, in line with the maputo declaration on agriculture and food security adopted by the african union in 2003. it in this regard that we launched the integrated management programme for agriculture and natural resources sustenta, which promotes the socio-economic integration of the mozambican population. mr president, the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic, officially announced by the who in december 2019, took the world by surprise. it is a health scourge with a high degree of spread and lethality, with greater severity in developing countries, particularly in africa. covid-19 has transformed the dynamics of trade, professional and social relations among human beings in all spheres of life, both in urban and rural environments. this scenario requires the mobilisation of additional financial resources to compensate for the economic slowdown, given that the scourge of the pandemic still prevails around the world and in our country, in particular. while response measures to covid-19 continue, we take this opportunity to thank the bilateral and multilateral partners of the international community for the multiple support that has enabled us to prevent and contain the spread of the new coronavirus and embark on what we call the new normal. excellencies! the massive efforts we have been making in the framework of peace and security consolidation, as well as in the implementation of the socio-economic development programme, aligned with the 2030 agenda, have been put to the test by terrorist acts and criminals in some districts of cabo delgado province, and by armed actions by allegedly dissident renamo groups in some parts of manica and sofala provinces, in the central region of the country. terrorists heinously kill people, cause displaced people, destroy housing and socio-economic infrastructure, plunder community property and keep children and women in captivity. as a consequence of these phenomena, more than 1,000 people have been killed, and some 250,000 people are internally displaced in other districts within the country. in the face of terrorist attacks, the government has responded firmly, on the one hand, with the support of local people, through actions to defend sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as to the protection of people and their property. on the other hand, the government has mobilized humanitarian assistance for the internally displaced people and promotes socio-economic development activities for the communities. it was under these efforts that we recently launched and operationalised the northern region integrated development agency (adin) with the aim of promoting multi-sectoral actions with a view to the integrated socio-economic development of the provinces of niassa, cabo delgado and nampula. aware that the terrorist actions of which the country is a victim have links with international groups that are also involved in transnational organized crime, we have sought to address this phenomenon in cooperation with other countries and regional and international organizations. in this context, we welcome all initiatives and partnerships that will go a long way in complementing our ongoing efforts to curtail the harmful actions of terrorists in our country. as part of the implementation of the peace and reconciliation agreement between the government and renamo, we are implementing decentralization and the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (ddr) process of renamos remnant armed elements that has already covered about 1,000 ex-combatants. we would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude for the role of the united nations and the international community, particularly the dynamism of the secretary-generals personal envoy. mr president, ladies and gentlemen! as we conclude our remarks, we reaffirm our firm belief that international security and peace making and maintenance, the preservation and respect for human rights and the promotion of sustainable development, only find fertile ground to flourished, in the common approach and collective action of all stakeholders in the world. we have said so with great humility and willingness to serve our people and to contribute to the prosperity of humanity. we want, with actions to contribute to the future we want, to shape the united nations we need, and therefore, renew our commitment to multilateralism, and valuing the most precious commodity of the universe, life, and quality life. let us therefore revisit our global commitment to the consolidation of the principles of the charter of the united nations, keeping in mind the main recipients of these efforts, namely we the peoples! happy celebration to the united nations! thank you very much!",Mozambique,Africa,59.7796096801758,6.605907032047802,1845.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.6260162601626016
CMR,75,2020,"mr. president, it is with great pleasure that i take the floor today to contribute to this years general debate on the theme: the future we want, the united nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism. first of all, allow me to congratulate you and the other members of the bureau on your election as president of the 75th session of the general assembly. i would like to salute your predecessor, ambassador tijjani muhammad-bande of nigeria, who efficiently led the work of the 74th session. i also take this opportunity to pay tribute to our secretary-general, mr. antonio guterres, who works tirelessly to build a world of peace and justice, in an environment marked by multiple bouts of upheaval. for the first time in its history, the high-level week is taking place without world leaders being physically present and the general debate is taking place by video teleconference. this technical feat compels us to work together to provide a coordinated response that will help curb this health crisis. heads of state and government, ladies and gentlemen, the united nations is celebrating its 75th anniversary a respectable age. it was baptized in 1945 and has helped to unite the efforts of all members to save future generations from the scourge of war, promote social progress and create better living conditions for all peoples. the past 75 years have shown that the success of our organizations mission depends on its ability to bring people together to meet the multiple challenges facing the world. excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, whether we like it or not, multilateralism is on our minds. nationalism can at times be appealing, but it must be acknowledged that the majority of todays problems are transnational in nature. there is no shortage of examples. i could cite among many others, global warming, migration, terrorism, trafficking of all kinds and so on, which can be combated only through international cooperation. for more than seven decades, multilateralism has spared the world the tragedy of another world war. it has contributed to economic development and technological advances in various parts of the world. while the united nations has played an important role in this process, it is clear that many conflicts and tensions remain. at the same time, as i mentioned earlier, new threats have emerged. rising inequality is one of them. in todays globalized world, cameroon would like that special attention be paid to the manipulation of public opinion and, in particular to the spread of false information through social networks, which increasingly constitute genuine threats to peace. above and beyond declarations of good will, my country believes that attaining the sustainable development goals also depends on how each member of the international community assumes its responsibilities. despite its limited means, cameroon strives to make progress in eradicating poverty, promoting the rule of law and improving the quality of education. but it must be acknowledged that low-income countries still have a long way to go. excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, since its inception, our organization has been committed to conflict management and peacekeeping. the increase in the number of peacekeeping operations is a poignant illustration. more than 70 united nations peacekeeping missions are in operation to support peace processes through, among other things, disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and repatriation, ceasefire observation and the maintenance of law and order. the growing collaboration between the united nations and other multilateral bodies in these areas is a step towards advancing multilateralism. this is particularly the case of the african union, with which joint missions have been deployed and whose example has inspired african missions. as a troop contributor to united nations peacekeeping operations, cameroon has shown an ongoing commitment to the maintenance of international peace and security. indeed, my country has continued to contribute to this multilateral effort. for decades, cameroon has contributed troops to peacekeeping operations, such as minustah, monuc, minusca and monusco, and can, i believe, be satisfied with them. excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, the maintenance of peace and security also requires the united nations to address the issue of climate change once and for all, as it has an impact on security. yet some deny it, despite the fact that the increase in natural disasters is a stark reminder. it is clear that climate change poses a serious threat to human life. that is why urgent measures must be taken to ensure the future of humankind and to acknowledge the right of humankind to live in a healthy environment. mr. president, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, because peace is not merely the absence of war, but also access to food and basic services, cameroon would like greater attention to be paid to the issue of development. at a time when many developing countries, in africa and elsewhere, combat poverty, it is important for the markets of developed countries to be more open to them. this openness would be a useful complement to the official aid and technical assistance that these countries receive from external sources. for its part, cameroon aims to build a society in which everyones basic needs are met. this entails ensuring food security, eradicating poverty, combating discrimination and expanding access to health care. it is in this spirit that my country adopted its national poverty reduction strategy. however, these efforts by my country are being hindered by the actions of the extremist group boko haram in the northern part of cameroon. a sociopolitical crisis has compounded those difficulties in the north-west and south-west regions of the country where armed groups are terrorizing the population. the governments efforts to protect the population and restore normal living conditions in the areas concerned have begun to show signs of success. a gradual return to calm is expected. my countrys government is determined to pursue its mission, based on the principles of the rule of law, human rights, and the eradication of all forms of discrimination, exploitation and injustice. in prioritizing the need for consensus, cameroon has successfully led a major national dialogue to address, among other things, the root causes of the crisis in the north-west and south-west regions to respond appropriately. the discussions have led to the adoption of the law on decentralization, which includes, in particular, granting special status to the northwest and south-west regions and implementing a reconstruction and development plan for the regions. while cameroon is making every effort to address the challenges threatening its stability and development, we must acknowledge that it is difficult for a country to face terrorism on its own. that is precisely why the international community must be called upon to collectively combat terrorism wherever it may be. mr. president, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, after 75 years of evolving efforts to achieve multilateralism, racism persists, barriers preventing the free movement of people are once again being set up, and fear of the other, especially migrants, continues to persist all of which call for genuine multilateralism. it goes without saying that the revitalization of the general assembly will have to be combined with the that of the security council, which has been under way for several years. with regard to that issue, africa expects all its partners to show solidarity in allotting two permanent seats, with all attendant rights, and two non-permanent seats to redress a historical injustice an arrangement on which everyone seems to agree today. the successful conclusion of negotiations on those two reforms would be the best anniversary gift that we the member states could offer to the un and all humankind, for whom our organization remains the most appropriate forum for promoting peace, security and social progress. i thank you for your attention.",Cameroon,Africa,78.2300033569336,3.103901398584921,1271.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.7867820613690008
NAM,76,2021,"namibia joins other member states in congratulating the president on his election to lead the general assembly at its seventy-sixth session, convened under the theme building resilience through hope to recover from covid-19, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of people and revitalize the united nations. we would also like to commend secretary-general antonio guterres for his profound and moving statement (see a/76/pv.3) highlighting the many challenges the world is facing while imploring global leaders to act now to solve those problems. we have heard his clarion call loud and clear. for the second year in a row, the world finds itself engulfed by the dark cloud of the coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic, which continues to claim thousands of lives daily. however, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. the global efforts to develop vaccines have been a scientific victory and a testament to human ingenuity. in just under a year the unexpected has happened. several different vaccines have been tested and produced to be delivered to millions around the world. unfortunately, the global roll-out of the vaccines has not been impervious to the scourge of inequality. vaccine apartheid has resulted in significant disparities in terms of the roll-out and availability of vaccines, with many people in developing countries left out. it is a pity that we have a situation where in some countries citizens are at the stage of receiving booster shots while in others many are still waiting to receive their first doses of vaccine. let us bear in mind that no one is safe unless we are all safe. covid-19 has affected poorer countries more acutely and unevenly. faced with high levels of debt and no access to finance, developing countries are struggling to mitigate the severe effects of the crisis. namibia, however, aims to deploy innovative approaches to ensure sustainable economic development in this volatile period of pandemic and climate change. given our renewable resources such as solar and wind power, as well as the ocean, namibia has decided to prioritize the development of green and blue economies. we are also well positioned through our recent membership in the high-level panel for a sustainable ocean economy to design and champion a sustainable blue economy, which will grow our economic base and create much- needed jobs while also tackling climate change. additionally, namibia has made progress in incubating renewable energy assets in the form of green hydrogen and ammonia as part of its energy order, in order to enable us to act in the best interests of our planet and its citizens. africa has come a long way from the days of the first wave of african leaders who paved the way towards independence. they were extraordinary personalities who forced us to fight for our independence. that first wave was followed by a second wave who were caught up in cold war confusion, one-party states and military coups. following the period of global conflict that was manifested in the form of the cold war, a third wave of african leaders has ushered in an era defined by democratic elections and term limits. the first wave of african leaders were our founding fathers. the second were caught up in the cold war confusion, and the third are those now in power who have come through regular elections and abide by term limits. but despite the fact that we have recently had a setback in two countries, unlike in the past, when others would tell africans what to do, it has been africans in the economic community of west african states and the african union who have made decisions about this, ostracizing such leaders and demanding constitutional order. that is now the new africa that we believe in, a new africa that believes in constitutional order. namibia stands firm in its belief that there is no room for discrimination of any kind in this world. in that regard, we remain committed to the implementation of the durban declaration and programme of action, which embodies our firm determination as the international community to rid the world of the scourges of racism, xenophobia and related intolerance at the national, regional and international levels. the question of palestine, now in its seventy-third year since the nakba, remains unresolved. on that crucial issue, namibia wishes to amplify the secretary- generals statement, which said explicitly that the leaders on both sides should resume a meaningful dialogue, recognizing a two-state solution as the only pathway to a just and comprehensive peace. similarly, after nearly 50 years the people of western sahara are still waiting to exercise their right to freedom and independence. namibia welcomes the secretary- generals appointment of mr. alexander ivanko as his special representative for western sahara. we hope he will devote his full attention to the matter to enable the people of western sahara to have the opportunity to exercise their right to self-determination without further delay. in the same vein, in accordance with resolutions unanimously adopted by the general assembly, we call for an end to the united states economic, commercial and financial embargo on cuba. the people of cuba deserve to pursue their development aspirations and attain economic freedom. we call on president biden who was an invaluable member of president obamas administration, which sought a rapprochement between washington and havana to rekindle the spirit of respect and peace between the united states and cuba that president obama pursued. as a member of the african union committee of ten heads of state and government, namibia is committed to reform of the security council. we therefore call on all countries to support that reform in line with the ezulwini consensus and the sirte declaration. as we continue to build back better, we have a collective responsibility to ensure the participation of women at all levels of governance and economic activity as a symbol of freedom and equality in society. namibia believes that womens participation and representation is central to equitable and sustainable development. we therefore continue to advocate for greater gender equality around the world and have set ourselves the challenge of leading by example in our policies, programmes and actions. we also take cognizance of the fact that our youth are the backbone of the global village and custodians of the keys to humankinds future. namibia therefore remains committed to supporting the development of our young people and promoting greater youth participation in all areas of society, since they have a critical role to play in promoting global peace and development. in illustration of our commitment to youth empowerment, my delegation includes two young ladies under age 30 one of whom is only 25 years old who are both deputy ministers. they, together with their peers, are the future. we are facing one of the most critical periods in human history. global peace, human dignity and the future of our global village are at stake. as we meet in this global parliament of humanity, we are called on by the citizens of our world to craft a collective way forward that will ensure that we recover from the devastation of covid-19 and chart a way forward towards a brighter future. although the task may seem daunting, through unity of purpose we will prevail. for where there is unity, there is the hope of overcoming covid-19. where there is unity, people can return to rebuilding sustainably. where there is unity, we can respond to the needs of the planet and respect the rights of all. indeed, through unity, we will revitalize the united nations, transforming it into a bastion of global democracy that will save the world from the scourge of war and reaffirm faith in the fundamental human rights, dignity and worth of each and every human being on this planet. i always say, one namibia, one nation. i say one africa, one continent. i say one world, one

MRT,76,2021,"at the outset, it is my pleasure to express my warmest congratulations to his excellency mr. antonio guterres on his reappointment to a second term as secretary-general. i am confident in the success of the great efforts and endeavours that he is making to reform and steer the organization in the service of peace and security. i also extend my congratulations to his excellency mr. abdulla shahid on his assumption of the presidency of the general assembly at its seventy-sixth session. i wish him every success in his noble tasks. i would also like to extend my deepest gratitude and thanks to his excellency ambassador volkan bozkir, permanent representative of the sisterly republic of turkey, for the great efficiency and professionalism with which he managed the previous session of the general assembly. this session is being convened for the second successive year at a time when our world is being subjected to a health crisis brought about by the spread of coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic and its variants amid increasing ramifications and challenges. the statistics are frightening. infections worldwide have reached the terrifying number of approximately 250 million, while deaths have exceeded 5 million, which is also a terrifying number as compared to the toll at this time last year. as for the other economic, social and humanitarian challenges and consequences of the crisis, they are even more serious than those of the health crisis itself at the global level, but even more acute and dangerous in developing and poor countries due to the fragility of their economies and their inability to endure crises of this kind and for such long periods which greatly threaten the lives of the people in those countries. the measures taken by the world to date to address the pandemic and its repercussions are below expectations and not up to the crisis yet. that requires that we all redouble and coordinate our efforts to enable developing and poor countries to access vaccinations in sufficient quantities. they must get help to boost their technical capabilities to speed up the pace of vaccination, on the one hand, and to contain the economic, social and humanitarian damage of the crisis, on the other hand. in that context, and from this rostrum, we reiterate the call made by his excellency president mohamed ould cheikh el ghazouani at several regional and international occasions for the complete and definitive cancellation of the external debt of countries of the african continent in order to enable them to overcome the economic impacts caused by the novel coronavirus disease pandemic. guided by president el ghazouani, the government of the islamic republic of mauritania has adopted many measures that made it possible to limit the spread of the pandemic and mitigate its effects on the population, especially the most vulnerable. the most important measures taken include launching extensive vaccination campaigns throughout the national territory, with the rate of vaccination shortly standing at 15 per cent of the entire population; imposing preventive measures on all national territory, which are strictly monitored; providing basic commodities to the local market, preventing speculation in them and reducing their prices, which rose globally due to the pandemic; providing essential medicines with fixed prices; bearing the burden of health insurance of 120,000 households, which is about 600,000 people from among the poor and vulnerable groups; and providing direct financial aid for thousands of vulnerable and poor households affected by the economic recession due to the crisis. the convening of this general assembly session represents an opportunity to study ways to raise the performance of our organization to achieve the sustainable development goals, which aim to address the major challenges related to the environment, climate, health, education, security, stability and development. from that standpoint, his excellency president mohamed ould cheikh el ghazouani announced a holistic economic revitalization plan, which seeks to address the negative effects and overcome the challenges and constraints of the covid-19 pandemic. it is an integrated economic programme aimed at achieving the necessary conditions for a new economic recovery that gives the private sector the space and incentives to play a key role. the programme seeks to create more job opportunities and conditions for an optimal use of our natural resources in the fields of agriculture, animal development, mining and fisheries. among the main themes of the programme are strengthening infrastructure that supports growth; strengthening the capacities of the social sectors and supporting demand; upgrading and supporting the productive sectors to achieve food self-sufficiency; supporting the formal and informal private sectors; combating desertification and drought; and supporting employment opportunities. the programme is being implemented in parallel with other programmes within the governments plan, launched by the general delegation for national solidarity and fight against exclusion, which aims to combat various forms of fragility and to ensure universal access to basic services, such as electricity, drinking water, health and education, combating poverty and promoting social solidarity. work is also being done to train and equip young people with the necessary skills to enable them to enter the labour market and contribute to the development of the national economy, as well as to enable women to play their role by involving them strongly in political life and the conduct of public affairs. work is also under way to consolidate the principle of the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary, to consolidate national unity and strengthen social cohesion and to moderate political life through extensive consultations with various national actors, building the rule of law and freedoms and laying the foundations of good governance. in terms of security and the fight against terrorism, in cooperation and consultation with our regional partners, the government of the islamic republic of mauritania has strived to develop an effective and efficient strategy to combat terrorism and the various forms of extremism as part of a comprehensive approach that takes into account the security aspects, religious dialogue and the economic and social dimensions in order to neutralize terrorism and dry up its sources of financing, while taking into account strict respect for human rights. during mauritanias presidency of the group of five for the sahel, the coalition for the sahel was launched at the nouakchott summit in june 2020. that framework aims to broaden support to the sahel countries, which in recent years have experienced a drastic deterioration in the security situation, forced migration, climate change and signs of an acute food crisis. this year, unfortunately, due to the significant lack of rainfall and its spatial dispersion, the already structural food crisis is likely to worsen. in the sahel, about 14 million people are suffering from food shortages, while 29 million are in need of emergency humanitarian assistance. as its current chair, my country considers the great green wall for the sahara and the sahel initiative to be of critical importance for the future of its 11 member states and for the living conditions of their peoples. the upcoming twenty-sixth session of the conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change should be an opportunity to mobilize partners to realize the commitments made in paris in january in to meet the glaring needs of the peoples of the sahel, who are desperate in the face of the vicious spiral of an unpredictable climate and growing insecurity. the transition and i would say, above all, access to clean and cheaper energy is fundamental in that respect. in that context, it is the moral obligation of our international partners to help the sahelian states meet those challenges. but it is also clear that the political leaders of our subregion must uphold their promises of good governance and the promise to ensure a return to constitutional order to better meet the aspirations of their citizens and improve their living conditions, namely, in fragile areas. the government of the islamic republic of mauritania stresses its unwavering support for all just causes throughout the world and in all international forums. from this rostrum, my country reaffirms the right of the palestinian people to live in dignity and sovereignty in an independent and viable state with east jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the arab peace initiative and relevant international resolutions and in the framework of a two-state solution, namely, two states living side by side in peace and stability. my country also reaffirms its commitment to its unwavering position regarding the conflict in the western sahara. we have not taken any particular side; we maintain excellent relations with all. we support the united nations efforts and all the relevant security council resolutions aimed at achieving a lasting solution agreed upon by all. in that context, my country urges the secretary-general to appoint without delay a special envoy to resume the process that came to a halt two years ago following the resignation of the former envoy. my country also reiterates its support for international efforts to successfully conclude the transitional period in sisterly libya and guarantee its unity and territorial integrity. my country also reaffirms the need to make serious efforts to reach a political solution that maintains the unity and independence of the sisterly syrian arab republic, the dignity of its people and its right to live in security and peace. finally, my country reiterates its support for the legitimacy of brotherly yemen. we call for a peaceful solution to the conflict pursuant to the gulf cooperation council initiative and relevant security council resolutions.",Mauritania,Africa,66.9599990844727,1.891970038414001,1572.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.6361323155216285
ZAF,76,2021,"president of the 76th session of the un general assembly, mr abdulla shahid, secretary general, mr antonio guterres, excellencies heads of state and government, colleagues, friends, we join todays general debate from around the world. the covid-19 pandemic has forever changed the nature of multilateral engagement, of diplomacy, of business, of basic human interaction. and yet even as we are separated by the expanses of geography, the noble ideals of fellowship, solidarity and cooperation stand firm. they are the bedrock on which the united nations was formed 76 years ago, and they have been our guide as we confront the worst global health emergency in over a century. the covid-19 pandemic has caused great devastation around the world. millions of lives have been lost and livelihoods have been destroyed. it has shaken our sense of well-being and security. yet, the strong bonds of solidarity between nations have enabled us to overcome great challenges. it was through multilateral solidarity, support and cooperation between member states that countries in need were able to access much needed medical equipment and supplies. in dealing with the covid-19 pandemic it is generally agreed that vaccines are the greatest defence that humanity has against the ravages of this pandemic. it is therefore a great concern that the global community has not sustained the principles of solidarity and cooperation in securing equitable access to covid-19 vaccines. it is an indictment on humanity that more than 82 per cent of the worlds vaccine doses have been acquired by wealthy countries, while less than one per cent has gone to low-income countries. unless we address this as a matter of urgency, the pandemic will last much longer and new mutations of the virus will emerge. south africa reaffirms its call for fair and equitable distribution of vaccines. we urge all member states to support the proposal for a temporary waiver of certain provisions of the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights to allow more countries, particularly low- and middle-income countries, to produce covid-19 vaccines. in this interconnected world, no country is safe until every country is safe. we need to prepare now for future pandemics and work with greater determination towards the goal of universal health coverage. in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, we must increase investment towards the achievement of the sustainable development goals by providing low-income countries with the means of implementation. in this respect, the g20 debt standstill initiative is a welcome response to the fiscal and liquidity challenges faced by least developed economies. the agreement on the allocation of $650 billion in special drawing rights is significant, but it is insufficient to meet the extent of the need. south africa therefore reiterates its call for 25 per cent of the total allocation, amounting to around $162 billion, to be made available to the african continent. mr president, climate change is an existential crisis for the entire world, yet poor countries are particularly vulnerable. although we bear the least responsibility for causing climate change, african countries are among those that carry the greatest cost. for the forthcoming cop26 in glasgow to respond adequately to the crisis we face, we need to see greater ambition and progress on mitigation, adaptation and the means of implementation. cop26 must therefore launch a formal programme of work on the implementation of the global goal on adaptation. the pandemic has been a stark reminder of our mutual dependency, and that instability in one region of the world inevitably impacts its neighbours. that is why we seek to enhance the relationship between the un and the african union in maintaining peace, financing peacebuilding efforts, and advancing post-conflict reconstruction and development. south africa continues with its efforts to contribute to international peace and security through our membership of the peacebuilding commission and our continued engagement in un peacekeeping. the right of the palestinian people to self-determination has been raised in this general assembly for almost as long as this body has been in existence. we raise it again today, not because we are bound by practice to do so, but because we resolutely believe that there shall be no peace and no justice until the palestinian people are free from occupation and are able to exercise the rights for which this united nations stands. we have a responsibility, as the nations of the world, to spare no effort in finding a just, lasting and peaceful solution based on internationally agreed parameters enshrined in the relevant un resolutions. we reiterate our position that the people of western sahara have the right to self-determination in line with the relevant african union decisions and un security council resolutions. south africa further affirms its solidarity with the cuban people and calls for the lifting of the economic embargo that has caused untold damage to the countrys economy and people. mr president, this year marks 12 years since the start of the inter-governmental negotiations process and 16 years since the world summit of 2005, where world leaders unanimously agreed on early reform of the security council. we have not honoured this undertaking. south africa reiterates its call for urgent reform and a move to text-based negotiations through which an agreement can ultimately be reached. we must address the underrepresentation of the african continent in the un system, and ensure that the voice of the african continent and of the global south in general is strengthened in the multilateral system. concurrent with achieving equitable geographical representation in the un we must also address the question of gender parity. yesterday, we marked the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the durban declaration and programme of action at the world conference against racism in south africa. this remains the international communitys blueprint for action to fight racism and other forms of intolerance. we are bound by a common responsibility to fight both the legacy of past racism and the manifestation in the present. racism, like sexism, xenophobia and homophobia, demeans us all. it undermines our humanity and stifles our efforts to build a world rooted in tolerance, respect and human rights. let us use this anniversary to renew our commitment to combatting racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance wherever they are found. mr president, the challenges we face are immense. we have to drive the global recovery. we have to implement the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. we have to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women. we have to address climate change, maintain peace and security, and protect societys most vulnerable. above all, we must close the wounds of poverty, inequality and underdevelopment that are preventing societies from realising their full potential. this can only be done within the framework of a revitalised and reformed multilateral system, with a strong, capable united nations at its centre. at this defining moment, this general assembly of the nations of the world is once again being called upon to inspire, to guide and to lead. the un stands as a beacon of hope for all who dream of a better world. let us, together, with the united nations as our instrument, write a new history for humankind - one of equality, freedom, fundamental rights and shared prosperity for all. leaving no-one behind i thank you.",South

RWA,76,2021,"excellency, abdulla shahid, president of the general assembly excellency, secretary-general antonio guterres excellencies, heads of state and government distinguished delegates fighting the covid-19 pandemic has challenged the international system like never before. however, alongside unfortunate examples of inequality, we have also seen evidence of the spirit of global solidarity and fairness, exemplifying the best values of our organisation. the covax mechanism, despite its limitations, is one such case. without this system, africas vaccine deficit would be even more severe. but we can and must do more, to speed up vaccine distribution in africa. doing so benefits the entire world. the positive steps from various partners and companies toward building local vaccine manufacturing capacity is also very welcome. we must harness this positive momentum to build long-term pandemic resilience, where it is needed most. the cooperation at the g-7 and g-20 to issue new special drawing rights is another positive example. a further voluntary reallocation of new sdrs to countries that need them most, will help create the fiscal space required for a faster and more equitable recovery from the pandemic. nevertheless, the world is seriously off-track with the sustainable development goals, as highlighted during todays food systems summit. in fairness, we were behind schedule with the sdgs even before the pandemic hit. but there is now increased attention to figuring out how to refocus our efforts, and catch up. we need to convert this sense of urgency into a durable political commitment to achieving the sdgs. that commitment must put climate change mitigation at the centre of our efforts. the severity of weather-related disasters is increasing year-by-year. we cannot afford for the result of cop-26 in november to be inconclusive or divisive. we also need to re-emphasize the importance of citizen-centred governance and accountability. this not only guarantees well-being and material progress, but also security, stability, and confidence in the future. the extremist ideologies that drive terrorism and genocide must be named, identified early, and dismantled, without ambiguity or hesitation. on that, we cannot afford to play politics. i wish to conclude with a strong endorsement of the secretary-generals report on our common agenda. the secretary-general is right to warn of a possible breakdown in the multilateral system, in the face of the covid pandemic, worsening conflict, the climate emergency, and chronic poverty. this would have disastrous consequences for all of us, and the risk should be taken seriously. the secretary-generals action plan merits our full support, particularly the need for a global vaccination plan, a renewal of trust between governments and citizens, more focus on the needs of youth, and a rejuvenated commitment to fact- based reasoning and science. whether we are able to convene physically for the 77th general assembly in 2022, or for the secretary-generals proposed summit of the future, depends on the actions we all take in the coming months. with determination and focus, it can be achieved. thank you for your kind attention.",Rwanda,Africa,75.9000015258789,5.589849948883057,488.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,4.0983606557377055
MUS,76,2021,"mr. president, it is indeed a great pleasure to see you steering the proceedings of the 76th session of the general assembly of the united nations. mauritius and maldives share common challenges as developing islands of the indian ocean. we wish to assure you of our full cooperation and support during your presidency. i extend my gratitude to h.e. mr. volkan bozkir for his successful presidency of the last session. let me also congratulate his excellency mr. antonio guterres upon his re-election as secretary-general of the united nations and thank him for his comprehensive report entitled our common agenda. mr. president, you have chosen a very appropriate theme for this session given the unique situation we are in for the past 20 months. building resilience through hope, recovering from covid-19, rebuilding sustainably, responding to the needs of the planet, respecting the rights of people, and revitalizing the united nations cover the whole range of activities which are not only urgent but also crucial if we are to ensure our long term continued existence on our planet, in a manner that enhances multilateralism and cooperation, protects the rights of people by reinforcing our institutions and the rule of law, and leaves no one behind. the covid-19 pandemic caught a totally unprepared world with unparalleled intensity, disrupting governments and societies, the multilateral system, and more importantly, the lives and livelihood of people. it has brought to light the scale of global interconnectedness. events in one country can have rippling effects across the globe. almost two years later, we are still grappling with the pandemic and its mutations and despite the fact that vaccines have come out amazingly fast, we are still not in a position to say that life is back to normal. in fact, just as many countries were finding it hard to find basic protective equipment at the beginning of the pandemic, they are now facing similar challenges to have access to affordable and effective vaccines. while advanced economies have been able to deploy massive fiscal stimulus to cushion the pandemics impact and have succeeded in achieving mass vaccinations, the policy response of developing countries has been constrained by several factors, and access to vaccines is still limited. inequitable vaccine distribution is not only leaving millions of people vulnerable to the virus, but it is also allowing new variants to emerge, with the result that recovery will take longer. we welcome the us initiative to organize a leaders summit to consider ways of eradicating the pandemic. the meeting held this week shows that bringing together world leaders, economic partners, and vaccine producers, and the scientific community can lead to concerted actions to fight the pandemic. we should strive towards producing more vaccines, more rapidly, and decentralize their production to cater for the needs of the people around the globe. multilateral facilities such as the covax should be fully funded and empowered to redistribute surplus vaccine doses. necessary technology and resources should be shared with developing countries, including sids like mauritius, to enable the roll out of vaccines for faster return to normalcy. in the same vein, unilateral economic sanctions should be reviewed in light of the humanitarian urgency to fight the pandemic. mr. president, with these initiatives, we stand a good chance to eradicate the pandemic or at the very least, be able to learn to live with it, but the world will still have to face the economic challenge that has come with the pandemic. covid-19 has severely impacted the world economy. mauritius was not spared and our gdp contracted by 14.9 per cent in 2020. public health spending has had to be increased significantly, together with a string of measures to assist business transformation, support the tourism sector, increase local food production, and support various sectors of the economy. along with the pandemic, mauritius has also faced other challenges concerning its financial services sector, and we have had to address these as a matter of great urgency in order to keep the sector afloat. mr. president, before the pandemic, small island developing states were already facing significant levels of debt distress. while we welcome the g20 debt service suspension initiative, we believe this facility should be extended to include small island developing states, in particular the middle-income countries as well. a new global financial architecture focusing on fiscal space and debt sustainability is urgently needed for sids. mauritius fully supports the proposal to produce a multidimensional vulnerability index to be used in determining the type and measure of support that will be needed by a country, not only to build its resilience, but also to put it on track to achieve its sdgs. mr. president, the paris agreement was hailed as a major breakthrough in our efforts to tackle climate change, but the climate events since, show that unless we commit to doing much more, our planet, and indeed our existence, are severely threatened. the last intergovernmental panel on climate change report is unequivocal, we are in the red and human influence is to a large extent responsible for the state of our atmosphere, ocean, and land. the world has great expectations from the cop26 summit. we all know what needs to be done; it is not sufficient to simply raise ambitions, but more importantly, we need to commit to deliver on them. we owe this to future generations. mauritius welcomes the fact that the green climate fund has nearly reached the level of contributions that has been pledged. but this will be meaningless unless access to it is simplified, especially for sids. mr. president, oceans are hosts to huge amounts and varieties of biodiversity that need to be protected. we support ongoing work for a legally binding instrument on biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction that would allow an equitable sharing of benefits. mr. president, the protection and promotion of human rights and gender equality should remain at the centre of all our endeavours. we have an immense responsibility towards our future generations. throughout the world, students and young people have been facing growing frustration because of confinements, education disruptions, and fewer job opportunities. special efforts need to be made to bring them in the mainstream. mauritius stands ready to support all initiatives in that regard. mr. president, one sector which has thrived during the pandemic relates to infodemics and criminal activities in cyberspace. this has to be addressed globally. we support the elaboration of an international convention on countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes. mr. president, the use of force to legitimize governments is a matter of grave concern to the international community and affects peace and regional stability. we condemn such acts just as much as we condemn the resurgence of violent extremism and terrorism in africa. we stand in solidarity with the afghan people and hope that peace prevails and brings stability to the region. we support all regional and international initiatives aimed at finding sustainable peaceful solutions. we also call for a just and lasting settlement for the palestinian people. mr. president, mauritius expresses the hope that under your presidency, the process of reforming the security council in order to make it more representative of the new realities will be accelerated. the historical injustice done to africa must be corrected. africa should have its rightful place in an expanded security council which should also include a seat for sids. mr. president, it remains a matter of concern that more than two years after the international court of justice ruled that the decolonization process of mauritius has not been lawfully completed in view of the unlawful excision of the chagos archipelago from its territory prior to independence, and that the united kingdom has an obligation to withdraw its unlawful administration from the archipelago as rapidly as possible, we still see no action on the part of the colonial power. and yet, the findings of the icj have been affirmed by un general assembly resolution 73/295 and in january this year, a special chamber of itlos has held that those authoritative determinations of international law by the icj have binding legal effect, rendering it beyond legitimate dispute that mauritius is sovereign over the chagos archipelago as an integral part of its national territory. the itlos special chamber also underscored that in adopting resolution 73/295, the general assembly has set out modalities for the completion of the decolonization of mauritius, which the icj has ruled every member of the un, and un agency, has an obligation to support. the itlos chamber will now proceed to delimit the maritime boundary between mauritius and maldives on the basis of mauritius being the coastal state in relation to the chagos archipelago. we note with further satisfaction that specialized agencies of the united nations such as the universal postal union have recently adopted by a large majority a resolution to give practical effect to general assembly resolution 73/295, thereby ensuring respect for international law and its obligations under the agreement it signed in 1947 with the un. mauritius looks forward to further implementation of resolution 73/295 by other international and regional organizations, with the support of un member states. mauritius remains committed to implementing a programme for the resettlement in the chagos archipelago of mauritian nationals, in particular those of chagossian origin who were forcibly removed by the uk from the chagos archipelago in violation of their basic human rights. i express, on behalf of the government and people of mauritius and in particular the mauritians of chagossian origin, our sincere gratitude to all the countries that have been supporting us in completing our decolonization and we appeal to the colonial power to comply with the rulings of the international courts and the resolutions of the general assembly. compliance with international law is the responsibility of all law-abiding states. mr. president, i would like to reiterate the commitment of mauritius to ensuring the continued operation of the defence facility in diego garcia. mauritius considers the facility vital to the maintenance of international peace and security in the indo-pacific region, and to efforts to combat terrorism, piracy, and the illicit trafficking of drugs and persons. in this regard, mauritius, as sovereign over the chagos archipelago, which includes diego garcia, stands ready to enter into a long-term arrangement with the united states in respect of diego garcia. mr. president, with regard to tromelin which also forms an integral part of the territory of mauritius, we call for the early resolution of the dispute over the island in the spirit of friendship that characterizes the relations between mauritius and france. mr. president, we can no longer afford to be fractious. we need to promote, preserve, and strengthen multilateralism. together, we can build more sustainable, equal societies and economies. together, we can transform our world into one that recognizes and respects the dignity of every human being. i thank you.",Mauritius,Africa,92.1500015258789,4.671510219573975,1809.0,6.0,0.0,6.0,3.316749585406302
GIN,76,2021,"first of all, mr. president, on behalf of his excellency colonel mamadi doumbouya, president of the national rally and development committee (cnrd), president of the republic of guinea and head of state, i should like to extend to you my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the general assembly of the united nations at its seventy-sixth regular session. i am firmly convinced that our assembly will greatly benefit from your rich experience, sir, and you can count on the full support of my delegation in carrying out your important mission. mr. president, your predecessor, his excellency mr. volkan bozkir, and his team, deserve our respectful tribute for the efficiency with which they conducted the work of the seventy-fifth session of the assembly. i would also like to reiterate my sincere congratulations and encouragement to mr. antonio guterres on his reappointment as secretary-general of the united nations. accordingly, we would express to him our great appreciation for the dexterity with which he has taken up his delicate mission. since his accession to lead the organization, he has never ceased to promote multilateralism as an essential tool in the management of world affairs. we reaffirm guineas firm support for the reform process he has undertaken. the theme proposed for this seventy-sixth session of the general assembly building resilience through hope to recover from covid-19, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of people, and revitalize the united nations is challenging in many ways. indeed, this session of the general assembly, like the previous one, is being held at a particular time, marked by the resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic (covid-19), with the appearance of new variants that continue to have a negative impact on the health, safety and lives of our populations, as well as on the economies of our states, which are already faced with a slowdown in international trade, a drop in investment and a reduction in the price of raw materials, all against a backdrop of a scarcity of sources of financing. this situation has considerably slowed down the pace of implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, jeopardizing the gains made. covid-19 showed the worlds dependence on technology and digital connectivity, to which more than half of the worlds population does not have access. this state of affairs increases inequality, undermines the resilience of the most vulnerable and requires urgent action, including the restructuring of the international financial architecture, the building of digital infrastructure and the production and equitable distribution of vaccines. in this context, the republic of guinea welcomes the measures taken by financial institutions and specialized organizations for public debt relief, in particular the international monetary fund, the world bank, the world health organization and the world trade organization, the allocation of $650 billion in special drawing rights and the financing of the covid-19 vaccines global access (covax) facility, which must take into account the disproportionate consequences of covid-19 on the states. like other countries, the republic of guinea did not sit back in the face of this pandemic. after the first case of covid-19 appeared on 12 march 2020, the guinean authorities drew up a contingency plan, which became a national preparedness and response plan against covid-19, in order to better coordinate and strengthen the interventions and capacities of health services. the implementation of this contingency plan required such measures as continued screening and vaccination, the increase in the number of vaccination sites, the implementation of a priority vaccination strategy for students and housewives, and the observance of preventive measures. with the support of its bilateral and multilateral partners, and with its own funds, the republic of guinea has endeavoured to improve the vaccination rate. however, in the light of the scale of the challenge, we still are requesting the support of the international community so that the entire guinean population can have access to vaccines. guinea is grateful to all donors who have been willing to assist it in this difficult phase. beyond the covid-19 pandemic, poverty in all its forms and dimensions, hunger, climate change, terrorism, irregular migration, violent extremism, intolerance, racism, conflict of all kinds and inequality continue to plague the world. these scourges that inhibit our hopes warrant our sustained attention and a vigorous response. it goes without saying that peace and security have been undermined in various places around the world, despite the international communitys immense efforts. indeed, the sahel region has been experiencing an upsurge in terrorist attacks for some time. armed groups present in border areas continue to plunge the population into grief and undermine republican institutions. we therefore reiterate our full support for the actions of the joint force of the group of five for the sahel and renew the call for increased assistance from the international community. the situation in the middle east remains worrying. the resolution of the israeli-palestinian conflict requires the creation of two states living side by side within secure and internationally recognized pre-1967 borders. in haiti, the assassination of president jovenel moise remains engraved in our memories. we reiterate our deepest sympathies to the people and the government of haiti and call on the international community to do more to help this country as it faces a cycle of violence and natural disasters. the republic of guinea reiterates its constant solidarity with the cuban people in their legitimate struggle to lift the unilateral economic and trade sanctions that have been imposed on them for decades. never before has our planet been so threatened with the corollaries of deforestation, greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change. as we prepare to join the twenty-sixth session of the conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, scheduled to take place in glasgow, scotland, my country, which has held the presidency of the group of 77 and china since 18 january, is concerned about the delay in climate financing, as well as the failure of major polluters to meet their commitments. as the spokesperson for 134 states, my country intends to play its full part at this global meeting, which will allow for the review of global programmes aimed at reducing pollution, protecting health and promoting national economic recovery plans. we will not cease to insist on the need for the developed countries to support the developing countries, which are the main victims of global warming. we take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude to all the member states that have placed their trust in our country to preside over this important group, whose role is increasingly important in defending the interests of developing countries. on 5 september, the cnrd, under the leadership of his excellency colonel mamadi doumbouya, took over the destiny of the republic of guinea. since its accession to power, the cnrd has reaffirmed its dedication to all of guineas international commitments by extending a hand of cooperation to the international community. in the ardent desire to respond to the legitimate aspirations of the people of guinea for peace and democratic progress, the cnrd has therefore initiated, since 14 september, national consultations leading to an inclusive and peaceful transition for a return to constitutional order. these consensual consultations, for which real enthusiasm is giving rise to hope, will make it possible to draw up a road map for a transition, including the formation of a government of national unity, the revision of the electoral rolls, the drafting of a new constitution and the holding of free, fair and universally accepted elections. the cnrd has already taken measures to ease the sociopolitical and economic situation, including the release of people arrested during opposition demonstrations and the reopening of air, land and sea borders to ensure the free movement of people and goods and promote good-neighbourly relations. steps were taken to allow political parties and civil society to operate freely. in order to leave no one behind, the cnrd has invited the guinean diaspora, wherever it may be, to make its contribution to the building of strong and sustainable institutions. in this historic undertaking to rebuild the country, the new guinean authorities are asking for the support of all bilateral and multilateral partners, with a view to making guinea a true state based on the rule of law. in our common struggle to build a new world, guinea values the promotion of multilateralism, the only way to lead humankind to a better tomorrow, within the framework of a reformed, revitalized and more democratic united nations, conducive to inclusive and supportive cooperation. the issue of africas representation on the security council must finally be resolved for the sake of the effectiveness of the united nations and for the justice that africa and africans deserve. to that end, my delegation reiterates its full support for the common african position as outlined in the ezulwini consensus and the sirte declaration. shared prosperity and peace in the world are at stake. as in the past, guinea will spare no effort to make its modest contribution to realizing a world of peace, justice and solidarity.",Guinea,Africa,45.3300018310547,2.040748206105857,1508.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,3.3156498673740056
KEN,77,2022,"i am grateful for the immense privilege of joining everyone here in the general assembly a privilege made possible by the peaceful democratic transition that followed the free and fair elections held in kenya on 9 august. those elections stand as a testimony of the universal power of democracy, as well as the manifest ability of african peoples to invest in stronger nations and a secure future by using robust institutions, effective constitutions and the impartial administration of the rule of law to guarantee the realization of our shared objectives. the general assemblys seventy-seventh session comes at a unique moment, as the entire world struggles with multiple grave challenges, including regional conflicts, the coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic, the triple planetary crisis, food insecurity and the rising cost of living. i take this opportunity to congratulate the president on his election and to express my confidence that his wealth of experience offers us significant assurance of his good leadership. the motto of his presidency, solutions through solidarity, sustainability and science, succinctly captures with particular resonance the urgent imperatives of our time. i assure the president of kenyas firm support and cooperation during his tenure. i also take this opportunity to commend his predecessor, his excellency mr. abdulla shahid, for his bold steps in steering the united nations community and for ensuring its business continuity under the unprecedented circumstances occasioned by multiple global threats such as the covid-19 pandemic. human well-being is under grave threat. the health of the planet requires urgent attention. the immense pressure exerted by conventional threats, such as climate change, the global food crisis, terrorism, cybercrime and armed conflict, has been compounded by the unprecedented and devastating disruptions caused by the covid-19 pandemic. i express my approval of the presidents theme for this years session, a watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges, because it boldly signals the window of opportunity that we now have to step up our engagement from firm consensus to decisive action. in many respects, the covid-19 pandemic stripped us of many illusions and exposed stark justice and solidarity deficits in the face of existential crisis. it brought into sharp focus the global economys two- lane highway, repressively patrolled by a rising tide of exclusionist nationalism a spectre that undermines prospects for collective action and significantly impairs the resolve of the international community to guarantee the fundamental rights, including the rights to safety and dignity, of the worlds vulnerable majority. it is also for that reason that many nations, especially in the global south, now advocate the democratization of global governance and a reimagined multilateralism that is inclusive and works for the good of all. kenya stands ready to work with other nations to achieve the pan-africanization of multilateralism and a more just and inclusive system of global governance. it is important to reflect on those matters as we do our best to get our people, enterprises and industries back on their feet so that the engine of development can power our societies towards a prosperity that actually leaves no one behind. building back better is the universal rallying call to incorporate lessons learned into doing more, in a better way, to recover from shocks. i would suggest that we have a golden opportunity to faithfully adhere to that motto by augmenting it, in word and in deed, with an additional b to make it building back better from the bottom. building back better from the bottom upwards is essentially about including the marginalized working majority in the economic mainstream. the bottom millions relentlessly wage their daily battle for survival in a crowded arena that is characterized by scarcity of opportunity and a generally precarious existence. the ingenuity, optimism, resilience and energy demonstrated by those in that ever-bustling bottom segment is sometimes called hustling. invisible to policymakers and beyond the reach of many public services, those hustlers take nothing for granted, surviving overwhelming odds and frequently achieving great success. in the words of abraham lincoln, things may come to those who wait, but only the things left behind by those who hustle. it is time to bolster the resilience of our nations to mainstream those millions through deliberate strategies and efforts to advance economic inclusion by building back better from the bottom. the interlocking challenges of conflicts, the triple planetary crisis and the global food crisis have impeded our momentum and obstructed our focus in achieving fundamental transformations towards sustainable development. in the horn of africa region, severe drought and the disruption of supply chains due to the covid-19 pandemic, as well as the russia-ukraine conflict, have left us food-insecure. consequently, we have been constrained to repurpose our strategies to prioritize drought and famine relief to insulate education from disruption and improve social protection and health-care systems in order ensure peoples well-being. many countries now bear witness to the unsettling phenomena of rivers, canals and water reservoirs drying up owing to droughts and heat waves occasioned by climate change. kenya is no exception. the northern, arid and semi-arid rangelands of our country have been gravely impacted by drought whose severity has not been experienced in 40 years. the scarce rainfall over three consecutive seasons has led to poor crops and pasture, leaving some 3.1 million residents of those rangelands severely food insecure. that unprecedented confluence of intensely adverse events has exacerbated water scarcity and starvation, which are worsened by rising food prices, thereby complicating kenyas road map towards delivering a good quality of life to its citizens and hindering our progress towards achieving sustainable development goals 6 and 2. severe drought has affected not only the horn of africa and the sahel regions; it also continues to devastate many others, including in asia, europe and the americas. if for no other reason, the fact that we are in this together must strengthen the case for concerted efforts across the continents. with that in mind, i call on member states and all relevant stakeholders to demonstrate strong political will and showcase effective cooperation by supporting the most affected countries both financially and by sharing land-restoration and climate-adaptation technologies. collaborating to expand inclusion can usher in a new paradigm of multilateralism for us. the latest report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change reminds us that we cannot afford to waste another moment debating the merits of doing something versus doing nothing. it will soon be too late to reverse the course of events, and then, even the best possible interventions will not suffice. every day is an opportunity for us as leaders to expedite our efforts to confront the triple planetary crisis. it should be recalled that during the stockholm+50 meeting, which kenya had the honour of co-hosting with sweden, there was agreement among states on the need to act urgently to address environmental impacts. given that consensus, it is deeply concerning that little progress has been made with regard to the action that is needed. it is time to collectively contemplate the urgent measures needed to implement the high- priority actions we must take in order to contain the ongoing disruptions, as well as deliberate on longterm implementation approaches to be undertaken. i fully agree with the secretary-generals memorable statement, that [w]e have a rendezvous with climate disaster (a/77/pv.4, p.3). i add that we must not be taken by surprise. if being forewarned indeed means being forearmed, this is our opportunity to mobilize with tremendous urgency and take action at once. the agricultural sector has an important part to play in reducing the severity of climate change. a number of practices have a bearing, positive or negative, on various dimensions of the environment. investing in modern agricultural technology is therefore one important avenue towards tackling prevailing environmental challenges. kenya is responding through substantial investment in climate-resilient agriculture. at the core of our 10-year strategy for agricultural-sector growth and transformation are nine flagships. they include the registration of farmers to direct incentives, improving farmer practices through customized extension services, the monitoring of emergency food-reserve stocks using a digital food balance sheet and the use of an early-warning system to monitor food supplies and market prices. agriculture remains the bedrock of the development of many nations and will therefore continue to hold the key to ensuring equitable and sustainable growth for our people. no country, large or small, has ever attained significant growth without modernizing its agricultural sector. and as we rededicate ourselves to those targets, we must, in the immediate term, find answers to the severe deficit in the availability, flow and accessibility of fertilizer to our farmers worldwide. i could not agree more with secretary-general guterres warning in this hall yesterday, that without action now, the global fertilizer shortage will quickly morph into a global food shortage (ibid., p. 2). we are encouraged to note that education, health, agriculture and numerous other public services have become increasingly reliant on digital access. the world needs greater investment in the development of information and communications technology (ict) infrastructure, accompanied by policies that support innovation and increased acquisition and deployment of technology. in so doing, we should be driven by the conviction that those measures offer a viable shortcut to poverty reduction and the promotion of inclusive development. i call for stronger global partnerships to enhance ict infrastructure in developing countries and bridge the yawning digital divide between the global south and the rest of the world. the general assemblys seventy-seventh session follows the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the united nations environmental programme (unep), unep@50, as well as stockholm+50 and the ocean conference in lisbon. the outcomes of those conferences demanded real commitment to addressing global environmental concerns as a matter of urgency and a just transition to sustainable economies that work for all people. the fifth united nations environment assemblys adoption in nairobi of the march 2022 landmark resolution to end plastic pollution is a decisive signal that the world is prepared and motivated to act to address that menace. kenya is committed to working closely with other nations to pursue legally binding instruments aimed at bringing an end to plastic pollution. as the host nation to unep and the united nations human settlements programme, kenya affirms that those critical united nations agencies have an indispensable role in the promotion of environmental sustainability globally, as well as in developing socially and environmentally sound sustainable cities. in keeping with its strong commitment to multilateral institutions, kenya has made more land available for the united nations office in nairobi (unon) to facilitate the upgrading of its complex. i take this opportunity to call on member states to complement that contribution through enhanced financing aimed at adequately modernizing the unon facilities nairobi. kenya remains a strong advocate for making the sustainable use of ocean and blue-economy resources a development priority, holding the firm belief that significantly increased investment in that essential sector can end hunger, reduce poverty, create jobs and spur economic growth. i urge the secretary-general to continue calling attention to the urgent need to develop that vital sector. in particular, i call on developed countries to invest in sustainable fishing, protect marine ecosystems and share ocean-based climate solutions with developing countries. for our part, i am pleased to report that, building on the historic 2018 sustainable blue economy conference, held in nairobi, kenya is reviewing its national blue-economy strategy in order to strengthen community structures in the participatory management of freshwater, coastal and marine resources and ecosystems. the strategy is expected to contribute to our economic development through food and nutrition security, coastal and rural development and income increases along the aquaculture value chains. it will also enhance maritime transport and tourism. we invite development partnerships to invest in africa towards building the capacity to sustainably utilize marine resources. we must rally together to make the best use of africas vast blue resources in developing our economies while meeting our climate targets. as we look forward to the twenty-seventh conference of parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, to be held in sharm el-sheikh in egypt, it is logical to expect that member states will shift their attention towards the development and implementation of frameworks for climate change mitigation. member states must complete their pending actions so they can turn to the implementation work that lies ahead. i therefore call on all of us to urgently deliver on all commitments made towards climate-change financing. it is critical to emphasize that we are running out of time in that regard. over the past decade, kenya has sustained its aggressive pursuit of rapid socioeconomic transformation through three principal road maps. the first road map is the kenya national vision 2030, the formal long-term blueprint aimed at transforming kenya into a newly industrializing, upper-middle-income country providing a high quality of life to all its citizens in a clean and secure environment by 2030. the second road map is the african unions agenda 2063. the third road map is the sustainable development goals. kenya seeks to tap into a variety of resources to catalyse the achievement of those interlocking and mutually reinforcing objectives. the disruption and ensuing crisis caused by the covid-19 pandemic compelled us to diversify our focus into new interventions, including an economic stimulus programme, a covid-19 economic recovery strategy and a covid-19 socioeconomic re-engineering recovery strategy, all aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of the pandemic. i confirm that we have done our utmost in the circumstances. nevertheless, it is not enough. kenya and the rest of africa, like other developing countries, are in need of greater international partnership and cooperation to avert economic crisis in the wake of the pandemic. developing countries, which are heavily burdened by external-debt servicing, run the risk of losing development gains because of the shocks inflicted by the pandemic and associated disruptions. i call on global financial institutions and the international community to take urgent steps to release all existing financial instruments in order to provide much-needed additional liquidity and secure better fiscal space for developing countries such as kenya to enhance social investment, support climate change adaptation and mitigation, address security needs and resolve development financing challenges. on behalf of kenya, i therefore join other leaders in calling on the world bank, the international monetary fund and other multilateral lenders to extend pandemic- related debt relief to the worst-hit countries, especially those affected by the devastating combination of conflict, climate change and the covid-19 pandemic. i also urge the group of 20 to extend and expand the scope of the common framework to suspend or reschedule debt repayments by middle-income countries during the pandemic recovery period. i would like the assembly to take a moment to consider the peace and security landscape one that is currently beset with multiple challenges but also abounds with considerable opportunities. our home region of east africa and the horn of africa, in particular, is burdened by significant conflicts and challenges that have implications for the regions development. we stand on the cusp of a vast opportunity to galvanize confidence-building measures in order to generate and sustain momentum towards sustainable peace. in its role as an anchor state in the region, kenya has sustained our investment in diplomatic efforts to find lasting peace in multiple situations within and beyond the region. although some processes have yielded undeniable success, challenges remain. i therefore strongly reiterate our call for partnership towards confidence-building measures and urge more concerted efforts to achieve sustainable peace and stability. kenya is currently serving on the security council. i am proud to confirm that our engagement over the past two years has prioritized regional peace and security, countering terrorism and violent extremism, peace support operations and climate and security as critical contributions to collective efforts to build a safer, more prosperous and peaceful world. i am also proud to state that kenya has continued to champion closer cooperation between regional mechanisms and the security council as an effective means for achieving international peace and security. kenya continues to advocate the renewal of the african union peace and security architecture, which draws comparative strength from the highly productive complementarity among the united nations, the african union and the regional economic communities. working closely with the other two elected african members of the security council, we are committed to finding a stronger african voice in the council and achieving a consensus-driven, rules-based multilateral system. it is our manifest intention to see greater pan- africanization of the global agenda in order to make multilateralism work for the people of the world in their diversity. it is time for multilateralism to reflect the voices of the farmers, represent the hopes of villagers, champion the aspirations of pastoralists, defend the rights of fisherfolk, express the dreams of traders, respect the wishes of workers and indeed protect the welfare of all the peoples of the global south. let me express my countrys strong collective conviction that the relevance, legitimacy and moral authority of the united nations will forever remain deficient and undermined in the absence of comprehensive reforms of the security council. we therefore remain firmly committed to reforming the security council to make it a more effective, representative and democratic global institution. given the magnitude and variety of challenges the world continues to confront, a more fit-for-purpose united nations is urgently needed, one that possesses the legitimacy and efficacy required to deal with threats to international peace and security. a just and inclusive world order cannot be spearheaded by a security council that persistently and unjustly fails the inclusivity criterion. similarly, threats to democracy will not be credibly resolved by an undemocratic and unrepresentative security council. it is vitally important for that critical institution to reflect the values it is entrusted to protect, defend and uphold on behalf of humankind. we welcome the call by president biden this morning for the expansion of the membership of the security council as a significant step in the right direction and look forward to building consensus towards realizing that. the covid-19 pandemic severely disrupted health systems, thereby seriously challenging the implementation of programmes that are vital for the realization of the health-related sustainable development goals (sdgs). to place us firmly back on track and accelerate our progress towards the sdg targets, it is imperative for us to foster sustainable partnerships among governments, other state actors, civil society and the private sector. that modality of collective action is particularly vital for building resilient health systems, whose importance in enabling us to withstand future pandemics and other health crises can no longer be disputed. for that reason, kenya will continue to strongly support the development of legally binding world health organization international instruments in order to anchor global solidarity and promote equity. the fact is that the covid-19 pandemic exposed, for all the world to see, the severe deficit of those critical values in our current multilateral configuration. global supply chains remained impervious to demand in the global south generally and to africa in particular. unequal access to vaccines underscored that unjust and unequal situation, with unforgettable clarity. whenever human life, security and welfare are in jeopardy, it is immoral to administer interventions through frameworks that are anchored on fundamental inequality. we are all witnesses to admirable demonstrations of effective solidarity in response to crises in various parts of the world. our knowledge of the possibility of spontaneous, yet resolute, global solidarity reinforces the african exception as particularly repugnant. from genocides and civil conflict to famine and pandemics, the african continent is consistently left behind to bear the brunt of weak solidarity and the disastrous failure of multilateralism. history indicates that the last time that africa was the focal point of strong and effective multilateral consensus was during the berlin conference of 1884-1885, and the character of the ensuing interventions casts a long shadow to date. not to put too fine a point on it, but the failure of multilateralism during crises, which relegates the people of africa outside the circle of moral consideration and normalizes humanitarian neglect and other casual injustices, is a failure of humankind. nothing about africa i repeat, nothing about africa or its peoples makes it acceptable for that type of failure to persist in this era, and we have an urgent moral duty to do better and right that wrong. for decades, africa has borne the brunt of three epidemics hiv, tuberculosis and malaria. i applaud innovative partnerships such as the global fund to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria for their progress in addressing the three menaces. i also welcome the ambitious targets set for the seventh replenishment cycle. kenya is committed to supporting the global fund and implementing agreed targets in order to actualize our pledge at the replenishment conference. kenya calls upon all countries implementing the global fund programmes, especially fellow african states, to remain at the forefront in championing the successful replenishment of the fund. in that way, the mobilization of much-needed resources will be enhanced, thereby bringing us closer to the elimination of those dangerous diseases. in conclusion, kenya joins the secretary-general in calling for the strengthening of multilateralism as the only sustainable path to a peaceful, stable and prosperous world for all. that is the imperative of our time and the call of this moment. it is time to work on the trust deficit with stronger conviction that none of us is really safe until all of us are safe. the theme of the seventy-seventh session, a watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges, demands that we recognize that the crises we must confront are interlinked in a complicated way. they can be effectively addressed only through more imaginative strategies and innovative formulas. a population of 8 billion people, in a densely networked world, increasingly looks up to the multilateral system as the anchor of their individual aspirations, both directly and indirectly through robust national frameworks. therefore, the united nations system is increasingly expected to be responsive to those needs, and the proceedings in forums such as the general assembly are expected to speak to ordinary people in the far-flung reaches of our incredibly diverse globe. it is impossible to address all their individual needs directly, but it is possible to respond to all of them by speaking with conviction to the universal values of equality, inclusion, justice, solidarity and collective action, while making sure that all our interventions effectively reflect them, with clarity. the integrity of the international order must be measured by the distance separating our resolutions, consensus and agreement from decisive actions, committed interventions and effective solutions. a watershed moment therefore demands that we reduce that gap drastically and quickly. kenya pursues numerous essential domestic agendas through the multilateral framework. we are heavily invested in the strength, effectiveness and eventual success of all the interventions formulated by the united nations. it is important that the output of this forum and other similar forums achieve immediate resonance in the minds and lives of our young people, who still seek the opportunity to express and actualize themselves; our farmers, who work to feed our nations; our jua kali entrepreneurs, who strive in pursuit of success in the informal economy; and our professionals, who formulate policy, implement strategy and monitor service delivery in the public and private sectors. africa places immense value on the international community and the tremendous possibilities it can unlock through inclusive, sustainable and effective action to transform the lives of our peoples and establish lasting peace, security and shared prosperity. this watershed moment is our chance to turn the key and open that door of opportunity. we can make progress in addressing the triple global threats and liberate ourselves from the shame of the past failures of multilateralism. at this watershed moment, we must not only choose but also act decisively to bequeath to our children and their children a greener, safer, healthier and more abundant earth. let us do it together inclusively and multilaterally.",Kenya,Africa,82.879997253418,4.511018018298153,3980.0,6.0,0.0,6.0,1.507537688442211
UGA,77,2022,"i congratulate the president of the general assembly on his election to preside over the assembly at its seventy-seventh session and assure him of ugandas full support. i would like to thank his excellency mr. abdulla shahid for his stewardship of the general assembly at its seventy-sixth session. i pay tribute to the secretary-general, his excellency mr. antonio guterres, for his commitment to the work of the united nations. the seventy-seventh session of the general assembly is being held in person for the first time since 2020, when the coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic made it impossible to do so. it is a timely reminder of the urgent need to strengthen international cooperation, collaboration and solidarity so that the world may take transformative actions to address the common challenges that include, inter alia, poverty, health, pandemics, climate change, food insecurity and biodiversity loss. as we celebrate 77 years of the united nations, we need a revitalized organization that is fit for purpose. we need our organization to be stronger than ever before. we believe that multilateralism is fundamental and crucial in addressing our common challenges. we believe that, by acting together in solidarity as nations, the world can effectively address the current and emerging challenges. responding to covid-19 has taught us a lot. we should scale up cooperation in vaccine production capacity and resource mobilization in order to support efforts to mitigate the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. we are thankful to our bilateral and multilateral partners that supported our response to the covid-19 challenge. the government of uganda attaches importance to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and continues to register progress in its implementation. it has continued to strengthen its institutional coordination to achieve the 17 sustainable development goals (sdgs), and its national sdg secretariat has been strengthened to support the coordination architecture in order to ensure that the country stays on track in implementing the sdgs. the government of uganda has fully mainstreamed the sdgs in its national development plan and is working together with the united nations family and other stakeholders. that will sustain and strengthen collaboration with all actors. however, the effective implementation of the 2030 agenda will require support in areas such as transfer of technology, capacity-building and financing. climate change remains one of the greatest challenges of our time. our collective effort to fight climate change is an irreversible process that must continue. however, we must note that, despite contributing an insignificant amount of global greenhouse-gas emissions, the african continent, like many developing regions of the world, suffers the effects of climate change to a disproportionate degree. uganda, for instance, continues to experience prolonged droughts and the melting of ice caps on its highest mountain, mount rwenzori, as well as floods, erratic rainfall patterns and landslides. moreover, as his excellency president yoweri kaguta museveni has said before, the climate change problem is also the result of irresponsible and sometimes greedy human actions. similarly, if underdevelopment persists, we can forget about conserving the environment. it is regrettable and hypocritical that some of the regions and nations that mismanaged the environment and are disproportionately responsible for global warming have embarked on a rigorous campaign to thwart the efforts of other countries to responsibly and sustainably develop their oil and gas sectors. our view is that development should be environmentally friendly, inclusive and provide benefits for all it should leave no one behind. uganda has continued to scale up investments in climate adaptation and mitigation measures, specifically with regard to increasing access to clean energy in order to enhance production, as well as increasing forest and wetland cover, among other interventions. climate change action must uphold the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and be consistent with a countrys national context. we therefore urge developed countries to fully deliver, in line with the paris agreement on climate change, on the commitments to the goal of providing $100 billion per year to assist developing countries in the climate change actions they take to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. south-south cooperation, a framework of international cooperation within the global south, continues to play a vital role in supporting developing countries in their efforts to address interlocking challenges. we applaud the countries of the global south for their solidarity in responding to global challenges. uganda will continue to work towards and support the strengthening of north-south, south-south and triangular cooperation at the united nations. as host country of the third south summit, to be held in kampala from 10 to 12 december 2023, we look forward to welcoming the leaders of the group of 77 and china. the world currently faces many challenges that undermine international peace and security. the russia-ukraine military conflict continues to cause more suffering, destruction and displacement of the civilian population, mostly women and children. the longer it persists, the more suffering, destruction and displacement we will witness. we are deeply concerned about the loss of life and the serious humanitarian situation. uganda supports dialogue with a view to reaching a peaceful resolution to the crisis. my president has said many times that, we think the best way is to negotiate. everybody who wants peace in the world should support negotiations in order to get a balanced peace that ensures safety for all. terrorism is currently one of the major global threats to peace, security, stability and social and economic development. no region of the world has been safe from the scourge of terrorism. terrorism and violent extremism continue to bring death and suffering to innocent people. terrorist groups such as al-shabaab and the allied democratic forces continue to commit terrorist acts in our region. as a community of nations, we must be unwavering in our resolve to prevent and combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. we should act in a coordinated manner at the national, regional and global levels to counter that threat. uganda will continue to support and actively participate in global and regional counterterrorism efforts. peace, security and development are inextricably linked and should be pursued simultaneously. recently, we have seen some progress in our quest for peace and security in our region. uganda, working with partners in the region and beyond, continues to support and advance peace and security efforts in the region. we remain actively involved in regional initiatives, such as those of the african union, the intergovernmental authority on development, the east african community and the international conference on the great lakes region, and we are encouraged by the progress that we have made and continue to make. we believe that long-term and sustainable solutions lie in those collaborative processes. the international community, in particular the united nations, should therefore continue to support conflict-prevention initiatives undertaken by those regional and subregional organizations. experience has shown that, when and where that has happened, the chances of success have been high. the conflicts in our region and beyond have led to an inevitable refugee influx into uganda. currently, we have more than 1.5 million refugees in the country the largest refugee population on the continent of africa and the third-largest in the world. we are committed to working with refugee-sending countries and regional and international partners to address the causes of the refugee crisis. we urge the international community to continue supporting our efforts in the region in that direction. the need to reform the security council is now more urgent and imperative than ever before. the current geopolitical realities make an increasingly compelling case for a comprehensive reform of the council to make way for equitable representation. africa, which has more than 1 billion citizens and accounts for more than 70 per cent of the issues on the agenda of the council, continues to suffer the historical injustice of having no representation in the permanent category of security council membership and is also underrepresented in the non-permanent category. it is time for the long-standing injustice and imbalance perpetuated in the current configuration of the security council to be addressed. uganda supports the comprehensive reform of the council and urges member states to continue working towards achieving progress in the intergovernmental negotiations so that africa can assume its rightful place in the security council. the movement of non-aligned countries (nam) remains a strong pillar in addressing global challenges within the united nations. we remain actively involved in nam, in line with its purposes and principles. in that regard, uganda will continue to collectively work with other nam countries to further strengthen the critical role of the movement at the united nations. as host of the nineteenth nam summit, to be held in kampala from 5 to 9 december 2023, we look forward to welcoming the leaders of the non-aligned movement.",Uganda,Africa,80.5899963378906,2.561050271769246,1454.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
CPV,77,2022,"the republic of cabo verde encompasses the inhabitants of the 10 islands that make up the national territory, located in the mid-atlantic, off the west african coast, and an immense diaspora, which is our eleventh island, scattered across the four corners of the world. as president of the republic and the highest representative of this global nation, i have the enormous privilege of extending my greetings to the entire general assembly and, from this rostrum, to bring mantenhas greetings, in the mother tongue of cabo verde from cabo verdeans to the peoples of the world represented in this hall by their highest dignitaries, expressing our best wishes for prosperity and happiness for all. we look forward, with hope, to the summit of the future in 2023, as foreseen in the secretary-generals proposal expressed in our common agenda (a/75/982), so that it may effectively help forge a new global consensus on what our future should look like, and what we can do today to secure it. with that in mind, cabo verde reiterates before the general assembly its firm intention to continue being an active and useful member of the united nations system, acting and articulating its action on four major fronts, from the more specific to broader: to fully assume its responsibility in the framework of national governance; to value its specificity and grow from its status as a small island developing state; to be a spokesperson in the context of the diversity of and the designs for africa, the continent to which it belongs; and, ultimately, to continue to be a champion of multilateralism for the advancement of the causes of progress and well-being of humankind. in their journey, small island development states (sids) face such structural limitations as geographical remoteness and isolation, their small economic dimension and dependence on imports and high costs, on the one hand, and exports of sector-concentrated services, on the other, which more frequently and intensely expose them and make them vulnerable to the impact of external shocks, whether climate-related, economic or of other nature, such as pandemics and geopolitical conflicts. for example, my country, cabo verde, in the past 15 years between 2007 and 2022 has suffered the economic and social impact of multiple crises: the economic and financial crisis of 2007-2008, at the very moment when we graduated from the list of least developed countries; the coronavirus disease pandemic, which caused a recession of 14.6 per cent in 2020; the ongoing inflationary impact of world events; and, in the last five years, one of the most profound and most serious droughts in the recent history of the country. but like other small island developing states, cabo verde has the ambition to become a small island developed state. in order to achieve that, cabo verde will have to progressively overcome its vulnerabilities and increase its resilience, and for this, it is imperative to be able to count on external solidarity in terms of sustainable financing and indebtedness, albeit always in a process and a logic of gradual reduction of the need for external support. although this is not a new narrative, it is nevertheless urgent that it be implemented, since with fewer than eight years to go before the culmination of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, all signs and indicators suggest that we are not moving at the desired pace for achieving the sustainable development goals (sdgs) by that date. it is also pressing because less than two years before the fourth sids conference, in 2024, it is certainly legitimate and expected that the conference make a transformative decision on the best evaluation indicators and the policy modalities that will best support sids in meeting the goals of the sids accelerated modalities of action pathway. cabo verde has already submitted its application to host, in 2023, the regional preparatory meeting of the sids members of the atlantic ocean, indian ocean and south china sea region, to which it belongs, and is also prepared to monitor and support the whole process up to the conclusion of the general conference in 2024. it is within this context of emergency that we welcome the secretary-generals recommendation and the decision of the president of the general assembly to establish a united nations high-level expert panel to conduct the effort, including the completion and use of a multidimensional vulnerability index (mvi). we look forward to a satisfactory conclusion of the work of the high-level panel, and, in particular, that the general assembly may adopt its mvi proposal, which we hope will be accepted and used in a consensual manner both inside and outside the united nations. after all, we, the sids, also want to free ourselves from the dependence on external support, which necessarily entails reducing our vulnerabilities, while also being aware of the duty to do our homework, to be competitive and resilient, and to achieve inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth. since 2015, africas cultural and natural, material and immaterial heritage has been celebrated around the world to raise awareness and sensibility on the importance of its preservation. the african union therefore proposed the theme arts, culture and heritage: levers to build the africa we want as the theme for the year 2021. however, in this regard, there are still questions about urgencies and the measures to be taken. in my capacity as president of cabo verde, and counting on my african counterparts, i propose investing in the preservation of the natural and cultural heritage of the whole of africa and reflecting on how to promote climate justice and equity in africa and for africa. it is a question of striving to reach consensus on a more flexible and less abstract notion of climate equity that places common but differentiated responsibilities at the heart of a public and global debate, and to create a common platform for africa, with view to transferring responsibilities from one generation to the next. accordingly, i must refer to the worldwide movement to support the candidacy of creolization and creole cultures for the world heritage list, for which i have accepted to be sponsor and spokesperson, as cabo verde was the first creole society in the world. this is a civil society-led initiative, which seeks for creole countries to be able to position themselves with one voice as to their intangible heritage, promoting peace, friendship between peoples and development cooperation, based on the values that creolization has brought to civilization and a new ethos based on tolerance, diversity and fusion of cultures. accordingly, we call for strong political support and engagement from dignitaries of creole countries and their heads of state. the adoption of the 2030 agenda and its sdgs was a high point for multilateralism, and its progressive implementation and realization should continue to benefit from the impetus of an increasingly renewed and reinvigorated multilateralism anchored on the united nations system. this has not happened at the desired level on the various fronts where, unfortunately, global challenges remain, while, at the same time, crises that have constituted genuine obstacles to progress have emerged, endangering the desired reinvigorating of multilateralism adapted and prepared to deal with the scale and complexity of the new challenges. in this regard, cabo verde advocates an effective, inclusive, preventive, dissuasive and cooperative multilateralism, which could, as has already been stated, establish, a new global agreement between states, as well as a new global governance for the international system. we advocate a multilateralism that calls for less confrontation between blocs and greater cooperation among member states in the construction and delivery to all of such global public goods as peace and security, human rights and sustainable development. finally, we call for a multilateralism that is useful and facilitates a more peaceful international context, which opens the doors for countries, such as cabo verde, to more external funding and more and better integration in regional and global value chains. in conclusion, i wish the general assembly fruitful deliberations during this seventy-seventh session, the results of which we hope may pave the way for and prepare the summits of the future and the sids conference, in 2023 and 2024, respectively. the future is to be found in each day that lies ahead, but also in the solutions we take and make possible in each of these days. we extend our best wishes to the united nations.",Cabo

SLE,77,2022,"let me commend the president of the general assembly at its seventy-sixth session, his excellency mr. abdulla shahid, for his sustained efforts in returning the general assembly to its pre-pandemic work pace and for his message of hope. let me also extend my congratulations to you, mr. korosi, on your assumption of the presidency of the general assembly. i am gratefully optimistic about your leadership in these unprecedented times. i also commend secretary-general antonio guterres for galvanizing the necessary multilateral support in search of solutions to meet the scale and urgency of current global challenges. his timely submission of his report entitled our common agenda (a/75/982), which speaks to strengthening global governance with a focus on a future agenda driven by multilateral solidarity and collective action, is also commendable. as our world wrestles with an unprecedented and volatile economic outlook resulting from the lingering effects of the coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic and other crises, the theme of this session, a watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges, is most appropriate and timely. our progress towards achieving the global sustainable development goals (sdgs) by 2030 has been complicated by the repurposing of global development and investment finance, disruptions in production and supply chains, growing food and energy insecurity, general slowdowns in the economies of nations and the perennial adverse effects of climate change. i call on the global family to be intentional and fair about developing innovative development financing products that are free from the stringent restrictions and high transaction costs associated with concessionary loans. multilateral financial institutions can de-risk investments that are critical to sustainable development. aid must also be aligned with domestic development priorities. the adverse effects of climate change know no borders. global warming, unpredictable weather patterns, rising sea levels and land degradation are taking a profound toll on global food and water security. there are associated governance and stability costs. we are informed that africa faces disproportionate risks and costs from climate change. we must therefore be consistent in meeting our commitments to all existing international frameworks for addressing climate change. beyond the usual declarations, we must collaborate on and coordinate mitigation efforts, improve infrastructure for early-warning systems, invest more in improving the management of water resources, promote disaster-risk management and enhance the conservation and protection of natural habitats. there are also opportunities, especially in africa, and sierra leone in particular, for just energy and rural agricultural transitions. fair and accessible multilateral climate financing can catalyse the global and country-specific measures and innovation necessary to build and support sustainable climate resilience. green investing can support sustainable development. in such efforts, the roles and interests of women and young people must be central to climate investments. sierra leone is fully committed to concluding a treaty on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. among other things, such a treaty must prioritize conservation measures, the fair and equitable sharing of monetary and non-monetary benefits, meaningful capacity development and the transfer of marine technology. human capital development is a critical driver of inclusive and sustainable economic development. sierra leone has increased domestic financing for education, provided teaching and learning materials and improved education policies and governance. more children and more girls, including pregnant girls, poorer and rural learners and learners with disabilities are now in school. but we can go beyond those access deficits. as co-chair of the high-level steering committee on sdg 4 and a champion of the transforming education summit, which just took place at the beginning of this seventy- seventh session of the assembly, i urge for concerted global efforts to address the learning crisis. we can mobilize innovative financing models, underwrite universal access, especially for girls and learners with disabilities, promote technology in education, make greater investments in foundational literacy and numeracy, address water, sanitation, hygiene and other infrastructure deficits, support school feeding programmes, fund technical and vocational training and finance other needs across the full spectrum of the education sector. with close cooperation among states, we are confident that we can address the learning crisis in our time. in order to address the global food crisis, which is disproportionately affecting the least developed countries, sierra leone joins the urgent call for action to escalate financing to support agriculture and irrigation and enhance food systems and nutrition for vulnerable populations and social protection for at-risk populations. sierra leone also associates itself with calls to ease global supply constraints, especially on fertilizers, rice and other agricultural commodities. multilateral support for establishing agricultural development banks that will support private agricultural investments and agricultural added value chains will promote self- sufficiency and greater resilience in that sector. the covid-19 pandemic reminds us that equity, multilateral cooperation and a comprehensive global response are what we need to address health emergencies that have a potential to undermine global peace, security and development. sierra leone affirms its commitment to global efforts aimed at exploring innovative and effective ways to enhance health security and pandemic preparedness, build capacities to respond to health emergencies and enhance greater resilience in health-care delivery. sierra leone believes that multilateral support is urgently needed to complement national efforts aimed at reducing maternal and child mortality, preventing epidemics, tackling tropical and communicable diseases, building health-care infrastructure and the capacity of health-care personnel and strengthening primary health care. efforts to increase the domestic financing of health care should be supported with increased multilateral financing and enhanced cooperation. sierra leone remains wholly committed to the global agenda that puts women and girls at the centre of inclusive and sustainable development. we believe that we cannot deliver on the 2030 agenda for sustainable development without the achievement of gender equality and womens empowerment. we must therefore garner multilateral support to achieve and sustain gender equality and the empowerment of women in our lifetime. sexual violence is a grave threat to justice and the fundamental rights of men, women and children throughout the world. in every corner of the globe, survivors of sexual assault are inhibited in holding perpetrators accountable and accessing empowering health, legal and economic remedies. in sierra leone, we have taken extensive legislative and administrative actions to address sexual and gender-based violence since my declaration of rape as a national emergency in 2019. last year, before this assembly, i announced that i had directed the permanent mission of sierra leone to the united nations to sponsor at the general assembly a stand-alone draft resolution on access to justice for survivors of sexual violence (see a/76/pv.6). i called for global solidarity on the issue and for the united nations to give all survivors of sexual violence the remedies that they deserve. on 2 september, the general assembly adopted by consensus the landmark resolution 76/304, entitled international cooperation for access to justice, remedies and assistance for survivors of sexual violence. i thank the assembly. the general assembly therefore affirmed the sincere and shared belief of the global community that sexual violence is condemnable, and that member states must take effective action to address it, as well as to provide access to timely and unimpeded justice through national legislation for victims and survivors. as the global community, we signalled our resolve to address that scourge. we must now do all that we can to implement access to justice and other remedies to ensure dignity for all survivors of sexual violence. small states make up the majority of the states members of the united nations, and they are the strongest advocates for the rules-based international system that underpins the work of the united nations. indeed, small states have served as key drafters, negotiators and thought leaders on a variety of international issues. they have diligently done that through transparency of purpose and coalition-building across the board. in that connection, sierra leone proposes further pursuing such values in the security council. i count on the invaluable and resounding support of this organ for sierra leones bid for a non-permanent seat on the security council for the term from 2024 to 2025, with elections to be held in june 2023. my government reaffirms its commitment to the relevant provision of the charter of the united nations and the declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples, as contained in resolution 1514 (xv). we join the call on all parties engaged in the dialogue on decolonization to continue to demonstrate good faith and a firm commitment to the conclusive and durable resolution of all sovereignty disputes. as the coordinator of the african union committee of ten heads of state and government on reform of the security council, i am pleased to note the commendable progress that has been achieved in the intergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the security council. we believe that the progress made during the seventy-sixth session of the general assembly is underpinned by the assemblys acknowledgement of the wider recognition and broader support by member states for the legitimate aspiration of african countries to play their rightful role on the global stage. as africa continues to advocate and canvass support for the african common position, as espoused in the ezulwini consensus and the sirte declaration, i urge member states to continue to demonstrate their renewed commitment and political will to correct the historical injustice done to africa by supporting the reform of the security council so as to make it a more inclusive, democratic, transparent, accountable, legitimate and efficient global organ, which properly reflects and adequately addresses the geopolitical realities of our present and future world. sierra leone is committed to engaging constructively within the multilateral rules-based order of the united nations. only through global cooperation can we engender and implement transformative solutions to global challenges.",Sierra Leone,Africa,48.6399993896484,8.539179801940918,1613.0,14.0,0.0,14.0,8.679479231246125
TCD,77,2022,"at the outset, i congratulate mr. csaba korosi on his election as president of the general assembly at its seventy- seventh session and wish him every success in conducting its work. i also pay tribute to mr. abdulla shahid, the outgoing president of the general assembly, for the dynamism with which he led the work of the seventy-sixth session. i further commend secretary- general antonio guterres and wish him every success at this difficult time of multiple and complex crises throughout the world. we reiterate to him chads full friendship and support. the seventy-seventh session, whose theme is a watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges, is taking place at a time when humankind is facing a multitude of challenges unprecedented since the creation of our organization. they are serious, complex and successive challenges to our collective efforts and difficult to address. the current international order, based on the charter of the united nations, is being severely tested, for instance, by the geopolitical tensions in several parts of our planet, including those caused by the ongoing war in ukraine, with its impact on the affected civilian populations and on the entire world at the economic, food security and energy supply levels. one of the difficult experiences we have faced was the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic that plunged our lives into a state of great upheaval. today the world is struggling to recover from the shock of covid-19. we have lived through that unprecedented challenge, enduring the loss of millions of human lives and its adverse health, social and economic consequences. the recent lull in the situation should not lead us to relax; rather, it should prompt us to further consolidate the multilateral cooperation we witnessed when states and organizations came together and supported each other to overcome the scourge. we hope to see a further consolidation of that multilateral cooperation, particularly in addressing other persistent and recurrent crises and challenges such as wars, terrorism, climate change, health and food crises and poverty. this session is therefore an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the principles and purposes of the charter of the united nations and to reiterate our collective commitment to realizing them, in particular through the implementation of the recommendations made in the declaration on the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the united nations (resolution 75/1). the time has come to take practical measures to achieve those objectives by correcting the many mistakes that have led to the recurrent problems hindering the work of the international community and preventing the full realization of the promises contained in the charter. in that regard, the secretary-generals our common agenda initiative, which is an action plan aimed at strengthening and accelerating the implementation of multilateral agreements, in particular the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, and making a concrete difference in the lives of people, is particularly welcome. it is indeed an important step in the right direction. chad fully supports the initiative and hopes that it will lead to the promotion, strengthening and prioritization of multiple concrete solutions to the major challenges of our time and have a real impact on the lives of the people, particularly those in poor countries, rather than being a sham of multilateralism that is limited only to lengthy statements that have no real effect. in that regard, it is clear that seven years after the adoption of the 2030 agenda and three years since its proclamation here in new york, the results of implementing the sustainable development goals are still far from being achieved, especially for poor countries. as the secretary-generals reports on that issue have mentioned, those goals will not be met, and many people will be left behind, if bold action is not taken. unfortunately, a downward spiral may be set off and cause disappointment in the hearts of millions of people around the world. that is why, in the wake of the declaration on the commemoration of the seventy- fifth anniversary of the united nations, the secretary- generals our common agenda initiative gives us hope that our legitimate expectations regarding international agreements and programmes, first and foremost the 2030 agenda, can be realized. all our actions converge towards sustainable development, but development is only possible where there is lasting peace and security. that is why the efforts of our states to achieve those objectives require increased and continuous support. the international commitments made to that effect through the 2030 agenda, the addis ababa action agenda, the paris agreement on climate change, the new urban agenda and all other international agendas must be honoured if we are to achieve the ultimate goal of ensuring that no one is left behind and having a planet that is fit to live on and can be passed on safely and proudly to succeeding generations. to that end, in the face of mounting and accumulating challenges, it is crucial to strengthen the existing commitments made by virtue of the indispensable solidarity that binds our states together, especially the rich and the poor, through development assistance, on the one hand, and the implementation of economic and financial empowerment mechanisms, as well as sustainable development policies in favour of the least developed and landlocked developing countries, on the other. despite geopolitical emergencies and various constraints, any approach or attempt to limit development aid would be counterproductive and could increase crisis situations in the world. chad therefore calls on donor countries to maintain and increase development assistance through the united nations, which provides unlimited assistance to hundreds of millions of people around the world whose very survival depends on it. i cannot but also mention the issue of debt, which continues to place an unbearable burden on many developing countries, including chad. that burden constitutes a real problem, hampering post-covid-19 recovery, economic recovery and the implementation of sustainable development programmes. debt relief therefore remains an urgent need to promote economic recovery in low-income countries and reverse the gloomy outlook for the global economy. from that perspective, chad reiterates its commitment to the various needs and initiatives to cancel or restructure the debt of developing countries. i also want to call for the swift implementation of the facilities granted to my country, chad, within the framework of the initiatives that various multilateral bodies have taken in order to enable us to respond to the pressing needs of our people, who already face the accumulating challenges of economy, humanitarian emergencies, insecurity caused by terrorist threats, the negative effects of climate change, the food crisis and others. regarding the political situation in my country, as the general assembly knows, we have been undergoing a period of political transition since 20 april 2021. i can tell everyone now that the transitional process is progressing satisfactorily. the transitional military council, headed by general mahamat idriss deby itno, and the transitional government, are committed to ending that process and achieving lasting peace leading to rebuilding the chadian state awaited by the chadian people. our inclusive and sovereign national dialogue, which is now under way, should lead to the holding of democratic, free and transparent elections. the dialogue brings together all the nations active forces and ensures the participation of political and military movements, made possible thanks to the doha agreement signed on 8 august. i take this opportunity to express from this rostrum the deep gratitude of the government and the people of chad to the government of the state of qatar, headed by his highness sheikh tamim bin hamad a1 thani, amir of the state of qatar, who kindly hosted and facilitated the pre-dialogue between the government of chad and the political and military groups. the inclusive and sovereign national dialogue, in which all segments of the chadian society participate including political parties, civil society, politicians, military staff, professional organizations, women, youth, people with special needs, expatriates, civil and religious leaders, defence and security forces and others is a historic opportunity for chadians to decide, in full sovereignty, how to rebuild their country. participants in the dialogue have discussed all issues related to the future of chad in complete honesty, freedom and sovereignty. the outcome of the dialogue will be implemented and binding on all. chad is counting on its partners to support and finance the implementation of the dialogues ensuing decisions and recommendations. of course, some have opted not to take part in that historic dialogue. endeavours are being undertaken to persuading those brothers and sisters to reconsider their choice and join the dialogue. in terms of security and development, the situation in the sahel and the lake chad region has become extremely worrisome and continues to deteriorate due to many factors, including institutional changes in many countries of the region, the dismantling of military counter-terrorism units, the effects of climate change leading to increased food insecurity due to the lack of an appropriate response, uncontrolled illegal migration and unchecked growth in illicit trafficking. with regard to the security situation, we note the resurgence of terrorist activities in the sahel, which has been relentless in its spread to neighbouring regions in west africa, especially togo, burkina faso and benin, where terrorist attacks have taken place. in the light of the continued deterioration of the situation, chad has continuously called for a new approach to the situation in the sahel so as to better adapt our responses. in that regard, chad welcomes the initiative of the united nations and the african union, in partnership with the economic community of west african states (ecowas) and the group of five for the sahel (g-5 sahel) to conduct a joint strategic assessment of the situation in the sahel and the appointment of the former president of the niger, his excellency mr. mahamadou issoufou, to head the independent high-level panel on security and development in the sahel, responsible for conducting the assessment. we have no doubt that president issoufou and his team will carry out an in-depth analysis of the problems plaguing the subregion and propose solutions to help us readapt the response to a multidimensional crisis that, despite the solutions already implemented, continues to deteriorate year after year. it is true that the sahel does not lack strategies or plans to address the crisis. the states of the sahel and their bilateral and multilateral partners have implemented measures that have been in place for almost 20 years, with results that have fallen short of our expectations. the strategic assessment will therefore enable us to understand the causes, although we already know that the terrorism which is spilling blood in the sahel cannot be defeated without the restoration of peace and state authority in libya. the many initiatives adopted by member states at the national and subregional levels continue to suffer greatly from the lack of adequate resources for their implementation. the g-5 sahel joint force, for example, is struggling to find sustainable and predictable resources to carry out its activities adequately. that is why chad once again calls on its partners to support the g-5 sahel in order to prevent the region from plunging deeper into violence and chaos. i reiterate the call of the g-5 sahel heads of state for sustainable and predictable funding from united nations assessed contributions for the joint force. with regard to the internal situation of the g-5 sahel, it has seen the withdrawal of the sisterly republic of mali. we regret that withdrawal, as mali was a founding member of the organization. its place will be preserved. we will not be able to defeat terrorism or achieve stability and development in the sahel unless we all join the struggle and pool our capabilities. we hope that our malian brothers will reconsider their decision and rejoin our joint organization. the door of the g-5 sahel remains wide open to them. with regard to the situation in libya, chad is concerned about the persistence of the political impasse related to the clashes that took place in tripoli on 26 and 27 august. chad once again urges the libyan political actors to prioritize dialogue in order to end the ongoing crisis and continue implementing the agreed elections agenda. chad encourages the international community, in particular the united nations and the african union, to pursue efforts to bring the positions of the various parties to the conflict closer together and foster political dialogue, as the libyan crisis will be resolved only through peaceful means and a libyan-led inclusive political dialogue. the persistence of the conflict in libya poses a permanent threat to neighbouring countries and the entire sahel region, for which chad has paid and continues to pay a heavy price. in that regard, chad once again reiterates its call on the security council and the secretary-general to implement the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process, which represents a lasting solution to the issue of its nationals engaged with the various libyan military factions. with regard to cuba, chad calls for the lifting of the economic and trade embargo imposed by the united states government on that country, which continues to weigh heavily on the lives of its people. concerning the reform of the security councilthe organ responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security chad once again urges member states to move from talk to action on implementing that reform and lifting the historical injustice against the african continent, which excludes it from full and fair participation in that organ. in that regard, chad will continue to fully support the common african position, as set forth in the sirte declaration and other relevant conventions. in conclusion, i wish the general assembly every success in carrying out its tasks.",Chad,Africa,27.2800006866455,2.601611889706404,2266.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.323918799646955
AGO,77,2022,"it is a great honour to take the floor in this majestic hall of multilateral diplomacy on behalf of his excellency mr. joao manuel gongalves lourengo, president of the republic of angola, who wished to be here in person to address the assembly but was unable to do so, owing to the general elections of 24 august and to his swearing-in ceremony. however, his excellency the president has entrusted me to greet all those present, especially his excellency mr. csaba korosi, and to congratulate him on his election as president of the general assembly at its seventy-seventh session and assure him of the support of the republic of angola during his presidency. this session, held under the theme a watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges, is taking place at a unique and sensitive international moment in our modern history, where we face complex challenges that call for joint solutions. the world faces persistent and cyclical challenges, which have been exacerbated in recent years by the international health situation brought about by the coronavirus disease pandemic, the emergence of growing threats to the economy, peace and global security, and the impacts of climate change. the republic of angola has championed at international forums the importance of multilateralism and international cooperation, which are mutually advantageous and beneficial to relations between states, be they large or small, developed or developing, because in our understanding that is how we can effectively contribute to the search for consensus solutions in resolving political, economic, social and cultural crises. world peace, which we all aim to achieve, will come about only through peacebuilding efforts in every country. in that regard, the republic of angola continues to make important efforts to contribute to peace and stability on the african continent and in its subregion in particular. in its role presiding over the international conference on the great lakes region (icglr), the republic of angola has spared no effort to contribute to peace and stability in the region, especially with respect to the conflict in the central african republic, but also with regard to the border dispute between rwanda and the democratic republic of the congo, as well as between uganda and rwanda, where we have modestly tried to do our best, since, as we know, the solution always and above all depends on the political will of the parties directly involved, as his excellency the president of the republic of angola, mr. joao manuel gongalves lourengo, recently reminded us. angolas peacebuilding efforts on the african continent have earned it the special recognition of the african union, which designated the president of the republic of angola, mr. joao manuel gongalves lourengo, an african union champion for peace and reconciliation at the extraordinary session of the african union assembly on terrorism and unconstitutional changes of governments in africa, which demonstrates our countrys commitment to mediation and consensus in resolving political crises in africa and around the world. those efforts have been galvanized by the support we have received from secretary-general antonio guterres. angola will continue to work closely with the united nations and the african union in peacebuilding and consensus-building efforts in order to resolve conflicts, with a view to achieving a culture of peace, security and stability, in the southern african development community, the economic community of central african states and the international conference on the great lakes region, as well as in the gulf of guinea commission and other regional organizations. the republic of angola continues to uphold the inalienable rights of all states to strengthen their own defence capabilities against external threats, equipping their armed forces with personnel, weapons and equipment that meet national needs. in that regard, we reiterate here our call for the lifting of the arms embargo imposed on the central african republic. history has taught us that we must discourage the use of force to resolve conflicts between sovereign nations, as the consequences for humankind are immeasurable. based on the principle of non-alignment enshrined in the constitution of the republic of angola, our country advocates for conflict resolution through dialogue and respect for international law. the political-military conflicts and the existing and persistent disparities in the economic and technological development spheres among world regions and geographic blocs represent a permanent threat and, at the same time, an opportunity for all humankind to join forces for their peaceful resolution. angola once again urges the end of the economic embargo against cuba and the removal of unilateral measures and sanctions against the cuban people, which impede their countrys harmonious economic, social and technical-scientific development. in general, angola favours the lifting of all unilateral sanctions or coercive measures imposed against the peoples of zimbabwe and venezuela, among others, without a mandate from the security council. such politically motivated measures have proven to be counterproductive to efforts to eradicate poverty and to implement the sustainable development goals, and violate the principles of the charter of the united nations and of international public and humanitarian law. negotiations for reforming the security council still have not produced the results that the overwhelming majority of member states expects. the republic of angola joins other voices in championing such reform towards an equitable representation that reflects the current configuration of the united nations. the ezulwini consensus and the sirte declaration represent a viable option for restoring the rights and legitimate aspirations of the african continent and correcting the historical injustices that the region is experiencing with its absence from the decision-making centre of one of the main statutory bodies in matters of international peace and security created by the charter of the united nations. angola held its fifth general elections on 24 august characterized by an environment of peace, harmony and transparency, thereby consolidating the construction of a democratic state and the rule of law with a view towards the countrys socioeconomic development. the newly elected government intends to continue to work on ongoing reforms as one of the priorities of its mandate. the republic of angola is aligned with the international consensus on sustainable development, including the african unions agenda 2063 on the environment. it has approved a national strategy on climate change and environmental education and plans to achieve the target of 70 per cent energy from non-polluting sources by 2025, favouring clean hydroelectric and solar energy. to that end, many substantial investments have been made in economic and social infrastructure in order to mitigate the effects of the prolonged drought that has affected the southern region of angola, with special emphasis on the inauguration in 2022 of an aqueduct in the province of cunene, which will provide access to water for 350,000 citizens over a span of 160 kilometres, ensuring a water supply for people, cattle and irrigation. in conclusion, i would like to announce that the republic of angola will host the tenth summit of the organization of african, caribbean and pacific states (oacps) in luanda from 6 to 10 december 2022, at a time when the challenges that the international community faces are increasingly complex and require the engagement and solidarity of everyone in order to overcome them. our purpose in convening the summit is to spare no effort to ensure that the oacps, which is now a full-fledged international organization, can play its role in the concert of nations. therefore, we hope we can count on the attendance and participation of all oacps member states.",Angola,Africa,72.4000015258789,2.385358984166333,1231.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.437043054427295
SEN,77,2022,"on behalf of the african union, i would like to express my thanks to your predecessor, mr. president, and to wish you every success in presiding over this session. i reiterate our support to secretary-general antonio guterres in carrying out his delicate mission in the service of member states. since the previous session, the world has become more dangerous and uncertain, under the combined grip of global warming, security and health perils and the war in ukraine. the theme of this session reflects the urgent need to act together to ease tensions, heal our planet, reduce persistent north-south inequalities and reinstate the importance of multilateralism. the security council is called upon, first and foremost, to address all threats to international peace and security, including in africa, in the same way. terrorism, which is gaining ground on the continent, is not just an african matter. it is a global threat that falls under the primary responsibility of the council, as guarantor of the collective security mechanism under the charter of the united nations. we therefore urge the council to engage more with us in the fight against terrorism in africa, with more appropriate mandates and more substantial resources. furthermore, the african union once again calls for the lifting of foreign sanctions against zimbabwe. those harsh measures continue to fuel a sense of injustice against an entire people and to aggravate their suffering in these times of deep crisis. in the middle east, we reiterate the right of the palestinian people to a viable state, living side by side in peace with the state of israel, each within secure and internationally recognized borders. we call for de-escalation and a cessation of hostilities in ukraine with a view to achieving a negotiated solution in order to avoid the catastrophic risk of a potentially global conflict. negotiation and discussion are our most effective weapons in the promotion of peace. i call for a high-level mediation mission, to which the african union stands ready to contribute. nearly 80 years after the birth of the united nations system and the bretton woods institutions, it is time for a fairer, and more inclusive global governance that is better adapted to the realities of our time. it is time to overcome reluctance and deconstruct the narratives that persist in confining africa to the margins of decision-making circles. it is time to do justice to africas just and legitimate demand for security council reform, as reflected in the ezulwini consensus. in the same vein, i recall our request for the african union to be granted a seat in the group of 20 (g-20) so that africa can finally be represented where decisions that affect 1.4 billion africans are being taken. i would like to extend my sincerest thanks to the partners who have already expressed their support and invite others to give favourable consideration to our candidacy. with respect to economic and financial governance, i draw the attention of the general assembly to the financing for sustainable development report 2022, produced by some 60 multilateral institutions, including the international monetary fund (imf), the world bank, the basel committee on banking supervision, the international association of insurance supervisors and the financial stability board. the report highlights shortcomings in the assessment processes of credit rating agencies and underlines the importance of transparent methodologies so as not to undermine confidence in ratings. we are concerned that the perception of risk in africa continues to be higher than the actual risk, which increases the cost of insurance premiums and undermines the competitiveness of our economies. that is why africa is renewing its proposal to the global crisis response group on food, energy and finance to engage, in conjunction with the g-20, the imf and the world bank, in a constructive dialogue with the rating agencies on improving their working and assessment methods. in the same spirit, in view of the unprecedented scale of the global economic crisis, the african union reiterates its call for the partial reallocation of special drawing rights, which are critical for developing countries, and the implementation of the g-20 debt service suspension initiative. this unprecedented shock further destabilizes the weakest economies and makes their need for liquidity even more pressing in order to mitigate the effects of widespread inflation and to support the most vulnerable households and social strata, especially young people and women. in addition, there is the need to address new and old health emergencies, including cancer, a silent killer that continues to claim millions of lives across the world. i call for general mobilization for the rays of hope campaign of the international atomic energy agency in order to strengthen the capacities of member states, particularly in africa, in the fight against cancer using nuclear technologies, such as medical imaging, nuclear medicine and radiotherapy. with the twenty-seventh conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change in sharm el-sheikh only a few weeks away, africa reiterates its commitment to the paris agreement on climate change. at the same time, we hope to reach a consensus for a fair and equitable energy transition, as called for at the african union-european union summit in february at the expanded session of the group of seven summit in june and, recently, at the africa adaptation finance forum, in rotterdam. it is legitimate, fair and equitable that africa, the continent that is the furthest behind in the industrialization process and is the least polluting, should exploit its available resources to provide basic energy, improve the competitiveness of its economy and achieve universal access to electricity. i recall that today more than 600 million africans still live without electricity. let us also work towards the goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year to support developing countries adaptation efforts and to finance the african adaptation acceleration programme under the auspices of the african development bank and the global center on adaptation. moreover, we see adaptation funding not as aid but as a contribution by industrialized countries to a global partnership of solidarity in return for efforts by developing countries to avoid the polluting patterns that have plunged the planet into the current climate emergency. beyond the current emergencies, i have come to convey the message of a continent that is committed to working with all its partners in a spirit of trusting dialogue and mutual respect. i have come to say that africa has suffered enough from the burden of history and that it does not want to be the breeding ground for a new cold war, but rather a centre of stability and opportunity open to all its partners on a mutually beneficial basis. i have come to say that we are not blind to an africa faced with challenges where it is necessary to bring about peace and stability. but i have also come to say that we also see africa as a provider of solutions, with its 30 million square kilometres, its human resources, more than 60 per cent of the worlds arable land and its mineral, forest, water and energy wealth. we have an africa of solutions, with governments daily on the job, a dynamic youth who innovate, take the initiative and succeed and millions of men and women who work hard to feed, educate and care for their families and who invest, create wealth and generate jobs. this africa of solutions wants to engage with all its partners in a reinvented relationship that transcends the prejudice that whoever is not with me is against me. we want a multilateralism that is open and respectful of our differences, because the united nations system, born out of the ashes of war, can win the support of all only on the basis of shared ideals, not home-grown values established as universal norms. it is by working together, while respecting our differences, that we will restore strength and vitality to the raison detre of the united nations, namely, to save present and future generations from the scourge of war, to advance the peaceful coexistence of peoples and to foster progress by creating better living conditions for all. i wish the seventy-seventh session of the general assembly every success.",Senegal,Africa,57.6699981689453,5.987539768218994,1360.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,2.2058823529411766
GAB,77,2022,"i warmly congratulate the president of the general assembly on his election and wish him every success. i also pay tribute to and congratulate his predecessor, mr. abdullah shahid, for his commitment during the seventy-sixth session. i reiterate my countrys full support to secretary-general antonio guterres as he serves our organization. i am delighted once again to speak in earnest, for the situation demands just that. indeed, the international system is at a critical juncture as the world struggles to recover from a pandemic and remains in the clutches of a multidimensional crisis. the emergence of new centres of influence results in entrenched positions and demands that we prioritize ongoing dialogue, instead of power struggles, to reach global consensus in addressing controversial issues within the multilateral system. in the light of the rivalry among powers and the multifaceted challenges that affect us all, it would be dangerously naive to continue focusing on power struggles or unilateral positions. the interconnected nature of global issues and national economies compels us to engage in dialogue in order to respond appropriately and above all collectively to the most serious threats to international peace and security. we are in the last quarter of a year of increasingly difficult global challenges that have thwarted common and individual efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals by 2030. with fewer than eight years left until the deadline for reaching those goals, it is crucial that we assess our progress in the light of the ongoing threat posed by the coronavirus disease pandemic to our economies. a threat just as insidious now looms over our economies: inflation. around the world, it is reaching tragic record levels. no one is spared neither businesses nor households, neither the north nor the south. its effects are devastating. as such, we must take action. of course, we must take individual action, which is precisely what gabon is doing by subsidizing certain commodities and controlling the price of others. nonetheless, it that regard too, we will be successful in overcoming that problem only if we take collective action in a coordinated manner and in solidarity with each other. it is yet another challenge the world must face. we must all meet that challenge together. this year marks many new beginnings for gabon, as we arise from the tragedy and forced inertia of the coronavirus disease pandemic and reopen to the world. we are the newest member of the commonwealth of nations, which is home to 2.5 billion people one third of the worlds population with shared values of respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law. my country is broadening the horizons of its citizens and seizing the chance for our young people to benefit by studying, travelling and building business relationships far beyond our own borders. at the same time, gabon takes its place on the world stage not alone but as a proud african nation. however, the problems that our world faces today are global, as are the solutions. we must all be outward-facing, not inward-looking, as we confront the difficulties of a world in which resources are finite and populations are growing. this month, our commonwealth family lost its leader her majesty queen elizabeth ii. through the union that she loved so deeply, the queen offered respect, friendship and wise counsel to many independent nations around the world, small or large. she promoted peace, liberty and shared values and fostered a spirit of cooperation. as the new head of the commonwealth, his majesty king charles iii can be assured of my full support and that of the gabonese people. as a dear friend of gabon for many years, king charles iii shares my enthusiasm for protecting our natural environment and biodiversity and my concerns about global climate and sustainability. fifty years after the stockholm conference, humankind faces an unprecedented triple environmental crisis climate change, the biodiversity extinction crisis and pollution, notably by plastics. first, with regard to climate change, thanks to its 88 per cent forest cover and a rate of deforestation well below 0.1 per cent, gabon is an exemplary high- forest, low-deforestation country. since the fifteenth conference of the parties (cop) to the united nations framework convention on climate change, which was held in copenhagen in 2009, gabon has net absorbed more than 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide. we absorb more than 100 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. in other words, we have already achieved and indeed have exceeded the paris agreement on climate change objective of carbon neutrality. we are counting on the creation of a net carbon sequestration market to enable us to maintain that performance through 2050 and beyond. secondly, i find the biodiversity crisis extremely alarming. the fifteenth cop to the united nations convention on biological diversity, to be held in montreal, will be a decisive moment for humankind, and it is critical that we adopt an ambitious global biodiversity framework. the time has come to transition from billions to trillions by mobilizing 1 per cent of global gross domestic product to benefit the natural environment. thirdly, pollution has become a chronic problem for our cities, rivers and oceans. we must waste no time in adopting a binding international agreement on plastic pollution, as well as a treaty of the high seas. to achieve the sustainable development goals, our international agreements and national policies must address the interdependence of those crises. threats to international peace and security continue to increase exponentially. faced with the proliferation of armed groups, restricting their access to arms will be at the heart of my countrys priorities during its presidency of the security council in october. in that regard, i would like to reiterate my countrys call for a robust partnership to ensure greater security in the gulf of guinea. many countries face humanitarian crises that are exacerbated by armed conflict. that is the case in ukraine, where the war has led to a worsening of the situation in countries and regions that were already experiencing food shortages. that is why my country has clearly expressed its opposition not only to that bloody war but to any form of war. gabon, which has never experienced armed conflict, will continue to advocate and favour dialogue and negotiation over confrontation. access to education for children should be considered sacred. therefore, i would like to express my countrys resolute support for the sanctuarization of schools and places of education, particularly during armed conflicts. to compromise education is to place a mortgage on future generations. it is in that vein that i have made the promotion of women and young people a key priority. in 2015, i launched the decade of the gabonese woman, which aims to reserve a place of choice for women and children in all aspects of governance in gabon. internationalism is at a turning point. we need to reform the united nations to ensure better consideration of the aspirations of africa. that is particularly applicable to the security council, where africas role needs to be consolidated. africa has waited long enough, and we will not wait any longer. in the light of the strong interdependence of nations, it is crucial that we put an end to the use of sanctions, while working instead to build bridges of prosperity. as such, i call once again for the total lifting of the embargo that has affected the government and the people of cuba for several decades. inevitably, the principal victims of any embargo are the weak and the vulnerable. in the middle east, gabon has always believed that the two-state solution is the only way to achieve peace and security. it is the responsibility of our generation to resolve that problem. in conclusion, i would like to reiterate gabons commitment to the principles and values of solidarity at the heart of the charter of the united nations. to that end, i reiterate my countrys solemn appeal to all members of the international community to live up to their shared commitments in order to ensure peace, security and dignity for the peoples of the world.",Gabon,Africa,85.6900024414062,2.207736503579309,1350.0,10.0,0.0,10.0,7.407407407407407
BEN,77,2022,"i have the privilege and signal honour, on behalf of mr. patrice talon, president of the republic of benin, who is unable to be here today, to deliver this statement, as follows: at the beginning of my remarks, i would like to extend to mr. csaba korosi my warm congratulations on his outstanding election as president of the general assembly at its seventy-seventh session. i would also like to extend my congratulations to his predecessor, his excellency mr. abdulla shahid, and his team for their remarkable work, carried out with competence and dedication, during their mandate, which deserves to be commended. finally, i pay a warm tribute to secretary-general antonio guterres, with all my appreciation for the commendable efforts that he continues to deploy, alongside the members, for the achievement of the noble objectives of our common organization. the theme around which we gather this year, a watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges, is a pressing call to action. indeed, this session is being held in a difficult international context, marked by the combined consequences of the coronavirus disease pandemic and the war in ukraine, with their economic, political and social impacts on the whole world. in terms of peace and security, the first pillar of united nations action and at the global level, action on our part, in the opinion of my delegation and in accordance with the position clearly expressed by the african union, calls for imperative respect for international law and the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of ukraine. we therefore urge the parties to the conflict to establish an immediate ceasefire and to open political negotiations without delay in order to save the world from the consequences of a planetary conflict. at the regional level, in this case in the area of west africa to which benin belongs, peace and security are threatened by the combined effects of the terrorist threat, on the one hand, and of maritime piracy, on the other, which constitute major obstacles to the free movement of persons and goods, as well as to the development of the nations concerned. those obstacles, far from being purely regional issues, constitute a global threat and call for an immediate, coherent and integrated response from the community of nations. in terms of development, the second pillar of united nations action, the time for diagnosis is long past, since we have already adopted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, whose articulations offer us a real plan of action for humankind and the planet in the immediate future and for posterity, in a more forward-looking approach. aware of its own responsibilities, africa, through the formulation and launch of a transformative vision for the continent, the africa we want, embodied by the african union agenda 2063, is resolutely committed to its economic integration and the acceleration of its industrialization, with added value and increased integration into global value chains. this means that the issue of africas development, as one of the eight major priorities of the united nations, must continue to be the subject of fruitful reflection, as was the case in july at the high-level dialogue on africa, organized jointly by the general assembly and the economic and social council. however, in this decade of action, it is urgent that concrete and bold actions accompany the reflections so that solutions can be found to the concerns of the african continent. benin, for its part, is resolutely committed to ensuring a common social minimum for all by tirelessly investing in the satisfaction of the vital needs of all its citizens, which are to dress decently, to eat properly, to be housed with dignity, to enjoy proper health care and to be educated in an appropriate way. to that end, and in addition to courageous reforms in terms of good governance and optimal mobilization of internal financial resources, the government of benin is investing in finding innovative sources for mobilizing the funds necessary for its development, through the successful issuance of special sustainable development goals euro bonds, for example. it is urgent that robust and appropriate support be provided to our countries, in support of their efforts, in order to consolidate and sustain the gains made, on the one hand, and to effectively meet the pending challenges, on the other. development, if it is to be sustainable, requires, in addition to its economic and social components, an environmental component without which it cannot exist. that is why it is more than ever time to pursue our joint efforts to deal appropriately with the problem of climate change, which poses a real existential threat for benin, due to the combined effects of desertification in the north, coastal erosion and the ongoing salinization of fresh water in the south, and the increasingly accentuated disruption of the cycle of the seasons throughout the national territory. in that context, benin has great hopes for the twenty-seventh conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, which will take place in november in sharm el-sheikh, egypt, and calls on the entire community of nations to hold fruitful discussions and achieve results that are commensurate with the stakes before and the restoration of hope. with regard to the promotion and protection of human rights, benin, at the international level and thanks to the start this year of its mandate as a member of the human rights council, contributes and will continue to contribute to actively promote and facilitate all initiatives contributing to the achievement of the sustainable development goals, which is the most concrete way to guarantee respect for the rights of the human person. at the national level, benin, among other actions, is investing in the mobilization, through various strategies, of resources to give the most vulnerable populations access to an adequate food system, high-quality education, health care that protects everyone, including the poorest, drinking water, electricity and clean energy. faced with the multiple challenges that challenge us, the time is more than ever ripe for the need to preserve and even strengthen multilateralism and make it truly inclusive and based on rules that are fair and valid for all, as a crucible for reflection and action to provide viable and comprehensive solutions. in this context, benin fully supports ongoing diplomatic initiatives within the united nations to find peaceful, lasting and equitable solutions to the question of the creation of a viable palestinian state endowed with the attributes of full international sovereignty and living in peaceful coexistence with the state of israel; to efforts to find a definitive solution to the question of western sahara, capitalizing on the achievements of the political process, under the auspices of the secretary-general, which is aimed at reaching a compromise solution, in the framework of the implementation of relevant security council resolutions; and to the question of the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed on cuba, concerning which benin associates itself with the declarations of the relevant summits of the community of latin american and caribbean states, on the one hand, and with the resolution adopted at the thirty-fifth ordinary session of the african union, held in february in addis ababa, on the other, to appeal to the need to end the said blockade in the name of the promotion of peace and development. better still, we call for the normalization of relations between cuba and the united states of america, which are two partners dear to benin. as the secretary-general underlines in his report entitled our common agenda (a/75/982), the history of humankind, ancient and recent, demonstrates that it is capable of great things when it acts united and that we are now more than ever called upon to make a fateful choice between remaining passive and promoting the continuation of the ongoing disintegration, or acting resolutely to build a better, greener and safer future. i remain convinced that we will hear the voice of reason in favour of action for a better world. the theme of this session is fully relevant at a time rightly described as decisive, it invites us to find transformative solutions, in the face of interlocking challenges. that will be possible only through the engagement of multidimensional partnerships involving governments, multilateral organizations, the private sector and civil society, with the common goal, in a spirit of shared responsibility, of taking bold action for the diligent implementation of existing agreements, in particular the effective achievement of the sustainable development goals. it is therefore with this call to responsible action, and with faith in our ability to work together to meet the challenges before us, that i wish full success to the work of the seventy-seventh session of general assembly, pledging the readiness of my delegation to spare no effort to follow up, jointly with other members, on the commitments made in the context of achieving the sustainable development goals by 2030. long live more solid, more inclusive and more coherent multilateral cooperation in the service of sustainable development!",Benin,Africa,47.0999984741211,3.377859204004521,1490.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.6711409395973154
MAR,77,2022,"on behalf of the delegation of the kingdom of morocco, it is my pleasure to congratulate the president on his election to preside over the general assembly at its seventy-seventh session. i wish him every success in his tasks. we also commend the distinctive work done by his predecessor, mr. abdulla shahid, and we highly appreciate the outcome of his presidency. we reiterate our support for the efforts of the secretary-general, mr. antonio guterres, to reform our organization. we express to him our support and backing for his initiatives and proposals contained in his report entitled our common agenda (a/75/982). the seventy-seventh session of the general assembly is taking place at a time when our world is witnessing multidimensional crises with global intertwined repercussions. three years after the onset of the coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic, our world faces a series of deep challenges and successive crises. what prevents us from managing those crises in an efficient and effective manner is not the fact that we are not aware of their manifestations and interactions, but rather the absence of genuine political will. the multilateral system is currently going through a systemic crisis that manifests itself at three interrelated levels. the first level relates to the crisis in values, in which the principle of cooperation and solidarity, on which the united nations was founded, is being undermined due to the prioritization of narrow national interests over universal human values. the second level is related to the divisions within international institutions, which have become an arena for competition in a way that negatively affects international multilateral action. the third level relates to the fragmentation of multilateral work in the context of narrow, circumstantial alliances, which are not commensurate with the current complex crises. the current international situation requires courage and objectivity to answer the following questions. do we want our organization to be capable of leading strategic changes and facing the major challenges of our time, or do we want it to be limited to only crisis management? does our organization still have the ability to reach an international consensus and find innovative solutions to deal with the current and future challenges of the world? we would like to say that those who believe that their own capabilities are sufficient alone to contain such challenges are not being realistic. multilateral work has never been a luxury, and the comprehensive crises that we are experiencing today confirm that and prove that the security and well-being of some depend on the stability and prosperity of others. the kingdom of morocco reiterates its conviction that multilateral action should be based primarily on collective interaction, consensual and renewed approaches, as emphasized by his majesty king mohammed vi in his address before the general assembly at its fifty-ninth session, when he said: morocco reaffirms its commitment to support the emergence of a new multilateral system built on international legality, justice and equity and cooperation in social and economic relations, and based on an efficient and dynamic united nations system. (a/59/pv4. p.23) the african continent is the most affected by the repercussions of the difficult economic situation as a result of the global geopolitical crisis, as it bears the brunt of the increase in food and energy prices, which undermines the continents gains in the area of sustainable development. despite that, africa has all the components to turn challenges into opportunities and emerge from this crisis stronger. the african continent has significant human and natural resources in addition to the gains and future benefits that it can achieve by implementing the african continental free trade area. that was affirmed by his majesty the king in his address at the 28th ordinary summit of the african union when he said: we, the peoples of africa, have the means and the genius, and, together, we can fulfil the aspirations of our peoples. in that context, the kingdom of morocco calls for promoting international cooperation to serve the interests of african countries by reducing the debt burden and launching integrated development initiatives that will enhance their resilience and resist the shocks of current and future economic crises. the repeated visits of his majesty king mohammed vi to several african countries attest to that conviction. his majesty has launched several cooperation and partnership projects to promote human development, guarantee food security and bolster economic growth in order to achieve african integration. under the auspices of his majesty, the kingdom of morocco hosted the fourteenth united states-africa business summit to encourage investment in priority sectors in african countries. several countries continue to suffer from the repercussions of covid-19. the challenge lies in providing a consistent and adequate supply of vaccines and distributing them equitably among all the countries of the world. as part of his commitment to the african affiliation, his majesty launched a new factory to manufacture covid-19 and other vaccines, a structural project that will promote the achievement of vaccine sovereignty in the kingdom of morocco and throughout the african continent, in line with achieving his majestys vision. the pandemic has demonstrated that good health and prosperity are not only a main goal of sustainable development but also fundamental conditions and pillars of sustainable development. the moroccan government, upon instructions from his majesty, is implementing and expanding health coverage, benefiting 70 per cent of our people. we hope to cover 100 per cent of the population by the end of the year. climate change requires immediate and urgent solutions. beyond well-intentioned statements, we need to contain this crisis, which is jeopardizing development in many parts of the world and could lead to famine, homelessness and environmental displacement. in that context and in line with his majestys vision, the kingdom of morocco has warned of the consequences of the climate crisis on the african continent, which has suffered its greatest impact. it is therefore incumbent upon the developed countries to garner the needed technological and financial resources to support the african states in addressing the consequences of that global challenge. the kingdom has decided to increase its nationally determined contribution and reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by 45.5 per cent by 2030, in the context of moroccos integrated strategy to achieve low- carbon development by 2050. the strategy is aimed at creating a green economy in line with the principles of sustainability, the pillars on which we have built the new development model within the kingdom. that ambition underpins the kingdom of moroccos intention to uphold the commitments it undertook at the 2016 african summit in marrakech, which was held on the sidelines of the twenty-second conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, under the presidency of his majesty king mohammed vi, especially with regard to developing capacities in the agricultural sector, adapting to climate change and increasing the use of sustainable energy. global tensions will continue to adversely impact the efforts being deployed to achieve food security unless countries develop their domestic capacities to take the new reality into account. in that context, morocco has been investing in the agricultural sector so that it can adapt to climate change. we have been strengthening south-south cooperation with the african continent, on which nearly half of the worlds unused arable land is located. at the national level, morocco is implementing the generation green 2020-2030 plan under the directives of his majesty in order achieve food security. the global security crises are directly affecting human migration throughout the world. in line with his majestys vision, the kingdom of morocco is committed to the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which was signed in marrakech in december 2018. in that regard, the kingdom will continue to demonstrate its solidarity in implementing its national strategy for migration and asylum, which was launched by his majesty in 2013. in the same vein, morocco continues to combat human trafficking networks, which represent a serious threat to the sovereignty and stability of states and the security and safety of individuals. peacekeeping is one of the most important achievements of the organization, and we must therefore pool our efforts and capabilities to develop it and guarantee peacekeepers safety. in demonstrating his permanent commitment to peacekeeping on the occasion of the sixty-sixth anniversary of the founding of the royal moroccan armed forces, his majesty gave instructions to create a moroccan multidisciplinary peacekeeping centre to provide training and support national and foreign capacities, especially on the african continent, in partnership with the united nations and several friendly countries, in order to promote the principles of international peace and security. gender equality and the promotion of the rights of women and their full participation in decision-making are preconditions to overcoming current and future global challenges. in line with that and with his majestys vision, morocco is working to promote gender equality as the foundation for a fair and democratic society. his majesty has given new momentum to gender equality through the full implementation of the provisions of the moroccan family code. the kingdom has also launched the first national plan of action for women, peace and security, as an integrated political framework for the implementation of security council resolution 1325 (2000), based on our belief in the importance of the full participation of women in preventing and settling conflicts. the kingdom of morocco reiterates its commitment to finding a definitive political solution to the contrived regional conflict over the moroccan sahara, which should be based on the moroccan autonomy initiative as the only solution to this conflict, while respecting the territorial integrity and the national sovereignty of the kingdom. since we introduced that serious and realistic initiative in 2007, it has been supported by the security council and more than 90 states. in the southern regions, the kingdom is implementing a new development model launched by his majesty in 2015. all those living in the region are participating fully in every stage of its implementation through their democratically elected representatives in the local councils of the moroccan sahara. the active participation of the inhabitants of the moroccan sahara in its political, social and economic aspects of life attests to their attachment to the territorial integrity of the kingdom of morocco and the moroccan sahara. in adhering to the statement made by his majesty king mohammed vi on the forty-sixth anniversary of the green march, the kingdom of morocco reaffirms its full support for the efforts of the secretary-general and his personal envoy for western sahara to relaunch a series of round tables, in the same format and with the same participants, to reach a realistic and lasting political solution based on consensus and in accordance with the relevant security council resolutions, especially, most recently, resolution 2602 (2021). the serious and well-intentioned participation of algeria in those round tables and the acknowledgement of its responsibility in creating and pursuing the contrived conflict will be the first prerequisite to reaching a final political settlement of the issue. the kingdom of morocco expresses once again its deep concern about the catastrophic humanitarian situation and the absence of the rule of law in the tindouf camps. in blatant violation of international humanitarian law, algeria has ceded its responsibilities over that part of its territory to armed separatist militias that have documented links to dangerous terrorist networks in the sahel region. we again call on the international community to urge algeria to respond to the calls made by the security council since 2011 and allow the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees to organize a census and register the inhabitants of the tindouf camps. in a letter that he sent on 20 december 2020 to his excellency mr. mahmoud abbas, president of the state of palestine, his majesty king mohammed vi reiterated the steadfast position of morocco in support of the palestinian question, called for the implementation of two-state solution, for which there is international consensus, and reiterated moroccos commitment to the negotiations between the palestinian and israeli parties as the only way to reach a final, lasting and comprehensive solution to the conflict. in his capacity as chair of the jerusalem committee of the organization of the islamic conference, his majesty reaffirmed that morocco would spare no effort to preserve the historical identity of jerusalem as a locus of coexistence and peace, continue to safeguard its special status, uphold respect for freedom of religion for the followers of the three monotheistic religions and defend the sanctity of the al-aqsa mosque. based on our commitment to improving the living conditions of the palestinians, his majesty led mediation efforts that culminated in the agreement to maintain the allenby bridge, also known as the king hussein bridge, linking the west bank and jordan, continuously open. that will have a positive impact on the daily lives of palestinians and facilitate the movement of people and goods. given its shared destiny with the state of libya and in order to build on the positive momentum created by the skhirat agreement and bouznika talks, the kingdom of morocco will pursue efforts to reach a peaceful settlement to the conflict in that brotherly country, in line with his majestys vision. we are committed to finding a libyan-led solution to the crisis, without any foreign interference or agenda. the kingdom of morocco welcomes the appointment of mr. abdullah bathily as special representative of the secretary-general for libya and head of the united nations support mission in libya, and reaffirms its full commitment to working with him and effectively contributing to efforts enabling the libyan stakeholders to reach the necessary agreements and organize parliamentary and presidential elections as the sole means to overcoming the current situation. the scope of todays challenges will require us to make one of two choices. either we disregard the current crises facing the world, or we intensify our efforts to address them constructively and effectively. our collective decisions will have a decisive impact on the lives of present and future generations. the kingdom of morocco, in line with his majestys vision and our actions since we joined the united nations upon gaining independence, the kingdom of morocco will continue to uphold its commitments.",Morocco,Africa,77.3499984741211,5.912246740612769,2351.0,7.0,0.0,7.0,2.9774564015312635
NER,77,2022,"at the outset, i wish to extend my warm congratulations and wishes for success to mr. csaba korosi on his outstanding election to the presidency of the general assembly at its seventy-seventh session. i welcome the leadership and commitment of secretary-general antonio guterres to peace and development, climate action, the coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic response, as well as his sustained efforts to find solutions to the various sources of tension throughout the world. in this decade of action to deliver the sustainable development goals, the climate emergency is creating humanitarian needs and exacerbating existing development challenges. alarming evidence from the intergovernmental panel on climate change shows that we may have already reached or gone beyond major tipping points and irreversible setbacks. climate change exposes the african continent to worsening food insecurity, population displacement, recurrent droughts and pressure on water resources. faced with the urgency of this situation, i welcome the fact that, during the special high-level dialogue on the theme the africa we want, organized on 20 july 2022 under the auspices of the united nations, the international community recognized that the twenty- seventh conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change (cop), to be held in november in egypt, is a unique opportunity to adjust this imbalance. in that regard, i would like to express the nigers commitment to the proposal of the african negotiators for a new objective of $1.3 trillion in financing by 2025 to better address climate challenges. in the sahel, a geographical area to which my country, the niger, belongs, climate change, which negatively influences agricultural and pastoral activities and water resources, is also the cause of extreme droughts, torrential rains and temperature increases above the world average. that is why the niger is paying special attention to the african great green wall initiative, which is part of the african union agenda 2063. in terms of security, the situation in the sahel and in my country has deteriorated considerably in recent years due to a particularly negative subregional environment. it all started, let us recall, with the fall in 2011 of the regime in libya, which to this day has been unable to restore a stable power that could exercise real authority over the whole country. consequently, the vast territory of southern libya has become a platform for transnational organized crime where the trafficking of arms, drugs, fuel and migrants prosper, perpetuating structural insecurity in all neighbouring sahelian countries. mali, which in 2011 succumbed to the violence that originated in libya, has never really recovered. it has in turn become an incubation centre for a form of terrorism that is characteristic of a sahel that is deeply affected by the effects of climate change preventing the practice of pastoral farming. that ecosystem of violence has had a deadweight effect on the young shepherds of the communities most affected by climate change, among whom a number of terrorist vocations have arisen. this scourge has spread from northern mali to the niger and burkina faso and is now attempting to spread to the countries of the gulf of guinea. the violence has such potential to destabilize state institutions that it resulted in the downfall of the democratically elected regimes of mali and burkina faso in 2020 and 2022, respectively. the niger, my country, in addition to the terrorist hotbed known as the three-borders region mali, the niger and burkina faso is also facing another terrorist hotbed in the lake chad basin, where the various groups that claim to be part of the shadowy boko haram operate. despite the strong pressures related to the circumstances i have just described, my country is showing great resilience centred on very wise governance, the promotion of a culture of tolerance and community cohesion, as well as the rules of democracy and the rule of law. it was that resolute choice of rights and freedoms that made it possible to organize transparent elections that sanctioned the first change of head of the state by virtue of which a democratically elected president passed the baton to another democratically elected president in april 2021. need it be said that our experience proves that the surest way to ward off the effects of terrorist violence is to strengthen the democratic regime and nothing else? the war against terrorism now requires us to devote significant resources to increasing the numbers of our forces, acquiring adequate equipment and building the capacities of our soldiers. allow me to take this opportunity to thank the various partners engaged with us in the fight against terrorism. i would particularly like to thank france, whose action through operation barkhane is a major asset in the struggle against our enemies. i also thank the united states of america, the federal republic of germany and all the other countries committed alongside us in various ways, all equally valuable. that being said, i find it crucial to point out that the international communitys commitment to the fight against terrorism in the sahel has shortcomings that need to be identified and addressed. indeed, this terrorism derives a large part of its financial resources from trans-saharan drug trafficking towards europe and asia, via libya. most of the weapons flooding the sahel terrorist violence market also come from libya. i believe that we are faced with a problem that is not particularly complicated. why then has it not yet been possible to set up an adequate system with the necessary means to combat this phenomenon properly? it is indeed time for collective reflection. it is time for the great powers present in that region and the international community as a whole to join the countries of our region in a far more relevant reflection to define an effective course of action in the fight against drug and arms trafficking in the sahel. despite the major challenges we face, as described earlier, the niger intends to remain a solid and stable state, backed by democratic institutions, and resolutely committed to the fight against poverty and for development. our deep conviction in that regard is that the most effective means of combating poverty consists in promoting education. the development challenges for the niger are summarized by the following simple statistics: an annual population growth rate of 3.9 per cent; an average synthetic fertility index of seven children per woman; a first birth for nearly 50 per cent of girls before the age of 15; and 50 per cent of the population aged 15 on average. those statistics say much about the state of the education system in our country, and that is why we are committed to act with determination to improve things in this area. as such, the agenda based on which the people of the niger elected us aims to take action on two fronts: improving access to and the quality of education. with regard to quality, we have decided to place particular emphasis on the quality of teacher training and the professionalization of teaching. with regard to improving access, our policy emphasizes the building of school infrastructure. the other particularly important aspect of our educational programme that i wish to emphasize is aimed at achieving gender equity and building residential facilities for girls in rural schools. indeed, because of the precarious living conditions of children in rural schools, far from their parents, the latter tend to prevent their daughters from continuing their studies. these adolescents are given in marriage as soon as they are out of the education system, which explains some of the previously mentioned statistics. in offering girls the tranquility and security desired by their parents, residential facilities also offer girls conditions in which to continue their studies with the possibility of staying in school and acquiring the necessary academic and professional skills. the large-scale expansion of residential facilities for girls in rural schools contributes to improved education-system performance and a reduction in the rate of population growth. my reason for highlighting our ambitions in the field of education for a country like the niger, after having spoken about climate change, terrorism and insecurity in the sahel, is that we are aware that these three issues demography, climate change and insecurity are closely related. indeed, the terrorism currently at work in the sahel is connected to the living conditions of certain communities whose environment has been considerably disrupted by climate change. the sahel is also an area that has experienced particularly high population growth in recent decades. the combination of these two phenomena demography and climate degradation has created, as a result of the regional disorder following the fall of colonel al-qaddafis regime in 2011, the situation of chaos that the countries of the sahel are experiencing today. that is why it is not enough for the united nations and the international community to be moved by or to discuss terrorist violence at length. we must act by investing the necessary resources in education to combat the violence of today and prevent the violence of tomorrow.",Niger,Africa,38.0999984741211,3.71231832079626,1497.0,13.0,0.0,13.0,8.684034736138946
BDI,77,2022,"praise be to god the almighty and merciful, who has allowed us to meet in the magnificent city of new york to participate in our organizations current session under the best conditions. at the outset of my remarks, allow me to express my sincere thanks to the government and the people of the united states of america, and more particularly to the people of new york, for the exemplary welcome and hospitality extended to me and my delegation. i would also like to express my warm and heartfelt congratulations to mr. csaba korosi, for his auspicious election as president of the general assembly of the united nations at its seventy-seventh session. burundi, through me, assures the president of its full support and cooperation throughout his mandate in the service of humankind. i would also like to express my deep gratitude to his predecessor, mr. abdulla shahid, for the remarkable work he has done under extremely difficult conditions marked by the ongoing crisis resulting from the coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic and by security crises in several regions of the world. in that context, i pay a well-deserved tribute to the secretary- general of the organization, mr. antonio guterres, who has spared no effort in accomplishing his mission well despite a difficult situation involving various crises and paradoxes. as the burundian adage states: in a climate of peace, a pruning knife can serve as a lawnmower in other words, where there is peace, anything is possible. the world today should take inspiration from this. unfortunately, the world has become an immense tower from which we witness, with tears in our eyes, gruesome acts in some nations due to war, horrible massacres, refugee flows, food insecurity and the destabilization of world economic systems. the countries of the world are experiencing the knock-on effects of the situation in ukraine. in africa, terrorism and violent extremism continue to strike in the sahel region, the horn of africa and in central africa, with a tendency to spread to the southern region of africa. the same is true in other parts of the world as has been noted, terrorism has no borders and climate change, which causes famine, has no limits. however, together, with political will, i am confident that we can overcome these scourges. i am confident because my country, burundi, has seen all too much, with repeated political crises that have destroyed not only human lives, but also the environment. today we have recovered, and the country is well on the way to socioeconomic development. burundi is striving to make progress in this direction, using the dividends of peace, security, stability and the social cohesion that has re-emerged thanks to burundians themselves and to the contribution of the international community. we therefore hope that everyone will embrace the spirit of peace, fraternity and justice so that all the peoples of the world may fully enjoy their right to live well and in dignity. on the humanitarian level, burundi has welcomed on its soil, with warmth and dignity, thousands of refugees of all ethnicities from the democratic republic of the congo. peace is a topic that is close to our hearts; its absence weighs heavily on the lives of our peoples. it is in this spirit that we will never allow ourselves to shy away from implementing security decisions taken by this important, dignified international organization, the united nations. with this in mind, burundi continues to fight tooth and nail to contribute to the return of peace in countries in which it has been disrupted, in the framework of the united nations, the african union or the region. our interventions in somalia and the central african republic are testimony to this. similarly, burundi is committed to contributing to the return of peace in the democratic republic of the congo in the framework of the east african community initiative. i take this opportunity to ask the international community to support the nairobi process to help the congolese people in distress. with further regard to peace and security, by participating in this meeting, i am led to humbly request the involvement of the united nations in tracking down the terrorist groups that are beginning to infiltrate our subregion, not to mention those already active in other parts of the world. the east african community, of which burundi holds the presidency, has just welcomed a new member, the democratic republic of the congo, and, together with the other heads of state of the member countries, we have set ourselves the goal of stabilizing the entire community, so that our countries populations can finally focus on socioeconomic development projects. that is why the government of burundi is developing transport infrastructure, including road, rail, air and water transport, in order to achieve the interconnected, multimodal approach at the national and subregional levels that is imperative for my country. burundi is working closely with the democratic republic of the congo and the united republic of tanzania to achieve the ambitious uvinza-musongati- gitega-bujumbura-uvira-kindu railroad project that will link the three countries, as well as the atlantic and indian oceans. this megaproject will not only boost the economies of the three countries, but will also facilitate the movement of goods and people in the subregion. we would like the states members of the united nations to stand as one to protect and promote all the rights that humankind must enjoy without distinction. while we appreciate what is already being done, work remains to be done in order for people to fully exercise all the rights to which they are entitled as human beings. i would therefore like to take this opportunity to warmly thank the international community for its efforts to restore peace and stability in my country. in that regard, i should like to inform this august assembly that equitable justice for all is today a reality, and that human rights, including freedom of expression and freedom of the press, are respected throughout burundi. unfortunately, however, some officials, under the banner of some of the organizations entities, are discouraging this positive development by politicizing democracy and the fight against impunity. in some countries, including my own, when democracy, as defined, takes root, some united nations officials distort that democracy, calling it untrustworthy and non-inclusive to perpetuate unnecessary tensions. whereas we fight on a daily basis against impunity, some of these officials still seek to disqualify our actions. it is therefore high time that the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights align itself with our countries to enable a common understanding of the direction of our countries policies, instead of trying to control their actions at a distance through committees and offices of special rapporteurs. the time has come for the united nations to recognize the progress made by my country over the past 17 years and to understand that the status of fragile country no longer applies to burundi. people are at the heart of the economy, from the family to the global level. we must therefore contribute to the development of human capital by providing our peoples with appropriate tools, experience and knowledge adapted to the demands of contemporary life. we must find solutions to counter the threats to our economy, health, education system and peaceful coexistence in short, threats to our way of life within our countries and among the countries of the world. we know that the united nations seeks to improve the living conditions of the worlds population through access to sufficient household income to ensure a decent standard of living. education is a key element in achieving that. in terms of education, i could not be more explicit than nelson mandela when he said: education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. so many years after this famous line was spoken, this idea for effecting positive change in our communities remains relevant. education creates aspirations and ambitions for the future in young people and is an effective tool in the fight against violence and terrorism. that is why, in my country, we are initiating reforms that rethink policy regarding the education system in order to turn our youth into members of, rather than tributaries to, the public service. we are pleased to note that, in my country, making education free has significantly increased enthusiasm towards school among girls and boys alike and that the dropout rate in elementary grades, which is often linked to food insufficiency, distance from schools and inability to afford school fees, has decreased significantly. in order to turn youth into agents of peace and inclusive development in burundi, we have put in place an ambitious programme of youth economic empowerment and employment with the aim of reducing unemployment by creating jobs for young people through entrepreneurship. alongside this programme, we have set up a youth investment bank and an accelerator, guarantee and support fund to facilitate access to credit. the same is true for women, who account for a high percentage of burundian youth. we have established a womens investment bank and are pursuing reforms to improve womens health and education. the office of the first lady of burundi has opened a hospital to treat obstetric fistulas and, together with burundis development partners, continues to innovate to greatly improve the lives of burundian women. meanwhile, managing the devastating effects of the covid-19 pandemic is an urgent task. to that end, i would like to make a strong appeal to all development partners of the african continent to take courageous measures to support the economies of african states, which have been hard hit by the various current crises. as no country in the world was created with the idea of forever receiving assistance, this support should be done through mutually beneficial strategic partnerships focused on, among others, investment, trade promotion and technology transfers. in order to develop human capital and to make the population dynamic and productive, my government is providing each commune with at least one hospital and health centres to prevent and treat diseases, including from epidemics and pandemics. while we are proud of having been able to effectively combat the covid-19 pandemic, the fight continues. furthermore, free health care has been provided for children under five years of age and pregnant women who give birth in public hospitals and health centres, which has significantly reduced infant mortality. the efforts aimed at my countrys economic development must primarily focus on developing the agricultural sector. to that end, my government has declared 2022 as year of agriculture in burundi under the general theme agriculture, source of the national economy. our agricultural development programme is all about changing mindsets and practices. we are encouraging the population to aim higher by producing not only for local consumption but also, and especially, for export, to join forces to work together in agricultural cooperatives and to progressively replace hoes with modern tools and agricultural technologies. concerning the environment, burundi has not remained idle, especially since we have experienced drought in some regions, the flooding of rivers and lakes and landslides that sometimes carry away human lives, houses and crops, thus leading to food insufficiency. in the light of this, burundi has joined the global consensus by carrying out environmental protection, conservation and management works through various activities throughout the country. furthermore, burundi is learning about climate change resilience, not only through the practice of hill irrigation but also through soil protection efforts, such as the drawing of contour lines and generalized reforestation, under the government project entitled ewe burundi urambaye, or covering burundi. every thursday is dedicated to this purpose throughout the country. we must also ensure that we progressively develop the infrastructure, in particular energy and transport, to support production and better ensure the growth of other sectors that drive growth and employment. the government of burundi is working on a huge project to develop the energy sector by mobilizing resources through co-financing and private-sector investment. the aim is to develop the potential of hydroelectricity, solar energy, peat, geothermal resources and municipal waste. the two sectors i have just highlighted also provide crucial support for the exploitation of mining potential. we want to forge a mutually advantageous and balanced technical and financial partnership in the exploration, exploitation and processing of mining and geological products, as surveys have revealed a subsoil that is very rich and as yet untouched. for peace and development to become reality, we have to prioritize good governance and the sound management of public finances, which not only helps to relieve the peoples frustrations, which are at the root of social conflicts, but also enables us to plan the national economy properly. i want to point out that we have strong national mechanisms for combating corruption and related activities. acts of corruption are dealt with effectively and our citizens are satisfied with our performance in this area. in terms of economic activity, burundi is on the right track, leveraging mining resources as well as road, sea and, soon, rail transport routes for economic actors. investors should know that the lake tanganyika shoreline is being developed for tourism and new tourist sites are being created in the interior of the country. before concluding my remarks, i would like to once again reaffirm my countrys determination to maintain good diplomatic relations and mutually beneficial, win-win cooperation with all states and international organizations in order to confront the fundamental challenges that are a threat to us all. we welcome our resumption of good political, diplomatic and economic relations that had previously been frozen with various states and international organizations. our ardent wish is to maintain strong relations with states and international organizations towards a bright future for burundi and every country in the world.",Burundi,Africa,75.5400009155273,4.437947705044285,2287.0,23.0,0.0,23.0,10.056843025797988
COM,77,2022,"at the outset, i would like to warmly congratulate his excellency mr. abdulla shahid on his effective leadership of the work of the seventy-sixth session of our assembly. i also wish to congratulate his excellency mr. csaba korosi, his successor, on his brilliant election and to assure him of the solidarity of the comoros as he carries out his mission. i also thank secretary-general antonio guterres for his sustained investment, as well as that of all his teams, in the service of peace and development. the seventy-seventh session of the general assembly is being held at a particularly delicate moment in the life of the international community. the face of the world is changing profoundly from one year to the next. indeed, three years ago our countries entered the worst health crisis in their history, marked by the coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic. the pandemic, as the assembly knows, has brought all the countries of the world to their knees and demonstrated that, big or small, we are all equal in the face of the epidemiological threat that today is one of the worst situations facing our global village. in that regard, the union of the comoros wishes once again to express its thanks and appreciation to all those who have worked tirelessly to provide, in just a few months, effective solutions that make it possible to restore hope in the world and to gradually emerge from this crisis that has seriously shaken the worlds economies. as if all that were not enough, another crisis, caused by the invasion of ukraine, has revealed once again, and in a dramatic way, the fragility of the multilateral system that brings us together today. with each passing day we are seeing the price of wheat and other food products increase to unprecedented levels, which jeopardizes food security by increasing the threats of shortage and famine. that is why my country condemns in the strongest terms this anachronistic invasion and urges the international community to convince russia and ukraine to resume as soon as possible the path of dialogue and mutual respect, the only things capable of opening the way to the cessation of hostilities. i would also like to welcome last julys black sea grain initiative, carried out under the auspices of president erdogan of tiirkiye and secretary-general antonio guterres and aimed at allowing the export of millions of tons of grain blocked in ukrainian ports. those agreements, which ought to be consolidated, are proof that dialogue can and must always prevail to prevent the world from plunging into chaos and misery. in addition to concerns related to the ongoing conflicts and health and food crises, the community of nations must continue its quest for appropriate solutions to political and territorial problems related to the sovereignty of states and the dignity of nations. in that respect, i reiterate here, on behalf of my delegation, the imperative need to find a rapid, just and equitable solution to the flagrant injustice that palestine is suffering. we must indeed find a solution that enshrines the right of the palestinian people to a sovereign state, with east jerusalem as its capital, living in perfect security and harmony with the state of israel because, as the comorian adage says, we choose our friends, but we do not choose our neighbours. with regard to the question of the moroccan sahara, i reiterate the unfailing support of the union of the comoros for the principle of moroccan rule over the sahara. the moroccan autonomy initiative, within the framework of the sovereignty of the cherifian kingdom, is, in our eyes, the best basis for reaching a timely, pragmatic and lasting solution to that regional conflict, which has gone on for far too long. my government therefore strongly encourages dialogue between our two brotherly countries, morocco and algeria, and welcomes all initiatives likely to contribute to ensuring peace in that region, in particular the relaunch of the political process, based on security council resolutions. in the same vein, with respect to the sovereignty of states, the union of the comoros reiterates its position on the need for the peoples republic of china to recover its integrity with respect to the chinese province of taiwan. in that context and given the threats that weigh on world peace today, which everyone recognizes and understands, my government invites all parties involved in the various conflicts to show restraint and a spirit of responsibility. with regard to the highly worrisome situation in the sahel, we know from experience how dangerous it is to allow hotbeds of tension to arise and become fertile ground for the expansion of international terrorism. my government is all the more attentive to this issue as we have seen the rise in power in southern africa of the barbaric al-shabaab phenomenon, which constitutes a threat on land and at sea for the entire continent. i reaffirm, as i did last year before the assembly (see a/76/pv.10), that these groups threatening peace in the world are not muslims. they are quite simply terrorists who have nothing to do with islam, which is a religion of peace, tolerance and coexistence. however, we are aware that behind these contemporary terrorist phenomena, which we must fight vigorously, there is also a great deal of frustration among young people who have no points of reference and are in search of a future. in that regard, i appeal to the great powers of this world and recall that while their support is an essential contribution to the economic and social development of the states under the greatest threat, said support should be designed in such a way as to also meet the aspirations of the peoples that benefit from it. i am convinced that nothing beats prevention when it comes to building peace, security and stability in the world. the only way is to manage the complex issues that threaten world peace at their earliest stages, through dialogue and diplomacy. i cannot talk about conflicts without mentioning the territorial dispute between my country and france concerning the comorian island of mayotte. my government, like all those that have preceded it, solemnly recalls before the assembly, and in accordance with international law, comorian sovereignty over this island, which was removed from comorian rule during the decolonization process of our country. the management of this painful dossier, which has lasted for more than 40 years, is very fortunately seeing new perspectives open up with the spirit of dialogue that has been created between the comorian and french parties. the principles and values of the united nations are now gathered around the sustainable development goals, which each country has made a priority. it should be recalled that climate change is one of the important elements of the sustainable development goals. however, entire regions are simply destined to disappear, while others are daily subject to the intensification of climate phenomena, such as floods, intense droughts, fires, coastal erosion or the acidification of the oceans. while these disasters spare no country or region, it should be emphasized that the case of island developing states like the comoros is even more worrisome and deserves greater attention from us leaders. i also take this opportunity to renew our condolences, support and sympathy to the authorities and the people of pakistan, and through them, to the bereaved families and the victims of the heavy floods that have affected this brotherly country. our states are also confronting other dangerous phenomena, such as piracy, pollution, illegal fishing, the plunder of resources at sea, human trafficking and drug trafficking, which require our utmost attention. my government joins all regional and global initiatives in waging a merciless fight against these barbaric acts, which are one of the major threats to the security of property and people. that is why i have always attached great importance to the security dimension in our geostrategic action, particularly in the mozambique channel area and the south-west indian ocean region. my country, the union of the comoros, has just celebrated 47 years of independence. although the first two decades following that regained freedom were marred by political unrest, turmoil and instability, the country has enjoyed peace and stability for more than 20 years now. it is therefore necessary to do everything possible to consolidate and perpetuate this newfound political stability because it constitutes a real guarantee of socioeconomic development. our salvation lies, in fact, in a peaceful, united society that is increasingly inclusive of all the structures that make it up. thus, with a view to better national cohesion and mid-mandate, last february we held a national political dialogue aimed at bringing together more comorian men and women around essential objectives, including peace, security and national unity, with a view to sustainable socioeconomic development. the assembly will understand why i wish to thank all the partners who were kind enough to lend their support to that dialogue. i remain convinced that all the vital forces of the nation that took part in that important meeting will work towards the consolidation of the achievements of the past 20 years, in terms of human rights and the democratic transfer of power, and thereby advance the development of the country. with regard to human rights, allow me to emphasize that my country works closely with the relevant regional and international bodies and has successfully passed the four-year universal periodic review mechanism of the human rights council in 2019. the constitutional and legislative reforms carried out confirm my countrys desire to make human rights a national priority. with respect to social outcomes and all other areas, covid-19 has been a concern and forced countries to prioritize its management. the union of the comoros experienced two waves, the second of which proved to be more virulent, claiming many victims. nevertheless, the situation in the country has been brought under control thanks to forethought and the provisions taken by the authorities in that respect, and with the support of our bilateral and multilateral partners, the communities and civil society. we thank them once again. it must be said that even if the union of the comoros is, thankfully, currently classified in the green category, we must remain vigilant, especially being an island country, in order to avoid a new outbreak of the disease. consequently, the comorian government is making considerable efforts to support the population on a daily basis, particularly in this time of global food crisis resulting from covid-19 and aggravated by the russian-ukrainian crisis. i welcome the action of all the development partners of the comoros and reiterate my thanks to them here. alongside the united nations system, the newly signed framework plan for sustainable development for the next five years perfectly integrates the priorities held by the emerging comoros plan, the reference framework par excellence for the development of our country. the combined efforts of the government and bilateral and multilateral partners must converge towards a major objective, that of the emergence of our country by 2030. in that light, in early december we intend to organize in the country a follow-up seminar to the conference of development partners that was held in france in 2019 in order to mobilize the promises made to support this challenge of emergence by 2030. i would like therefore to launch from this rostrum a friendly and fraternal appeal to all our partners to find together the ways and means of evolving towards the concretization of the commitments we made in paris to finance the various projects targeted in the programme. at the regional level, i attach particular importance to the close cooperation that exists between the comoros and the countries with which we share a common destiny in the indian ocean area. the union of the comoros also participates in regional efforts aimed at ensuring security in eastern africa and, in that context, supports the sisterly republic of mozambique in its fight against terrorism, a scourge that spares no country. regional and international solidarity must therefore prevail if we are to wage a merciless fight against this scourge and ensure the safety of all. our presence every year here at the united nations is irrefutable proof of the interest we place in multilateralism and of our conviction of the major role of the organization in further humanizing the world. this year, it reflects an even stronger and unshakable common resolve to act for the good of our respective peoples. in conclusion, i would like to stress the need for continued unity and solidarity within the international community. it is together and within an organized framework that we will find the appropriate solutions to the great challenges of our time, for greater peace and progress, and for the betterment of all of us and generations to come.",Comoros,Africa,61.7099990844727,2.431644241109244,2124.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.9416195856873822
BFA,77,2022,"i would like to begin by expressing my warmest and most heartfelt congratulations to you, sir, on your election as president of the united nations general assembly at its seventy-seventh session. i am confident that your vast experience, deep knowledge of the united nations system and well-known commitment to multilateral diplomacy will ensure the success of your mandate. i also want to assure you of the full support of the delegation of burkina faso in your exercise of your burdensome duty and in the success of our work. my congratulations also go to your predecessor, mr. abdulla shahid, for his admirable stewardship of the work of the general assembly at its seventy-sixth session. and i solemnly reaffirm burkina fasos gratitude to secretary-general antonio guterres for his constant, resolute and renewed commitment to peace and security and development. i would like to take the opportunity today in this hall to welcome the holding of the transforming education summit, which has enabled a broad mobilization of actors in the education arena. i dare to hope that the global commitment to the implementation of the summits conclusions will contribute significantly to accelerating progress towards achieving quality education for all, particularly in the countries of the south. the theme of the general assembly at this session, a watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges, aptly highlights the urgency and the historic responsibility borne by the political, economic and social actors of our time in the face of the multiple crises facing our planet. while the world is gradually recovering from the coronavirus disease pandemic, other scourges such as terrorism, intra- and inter-state conflicts and the humanitarian and food security crises they engender, along with climate change and its perverse effects continue to blight daily life across the world. they serve as a reminder that we are fragile, individually and collectively, that countries and peoples are interdependent, and that international solidarity is urgently needed. if we want to save humankind from collective and inescapable peril, we must not ignore that reminder. the end of the cold war gave us an opportunity to dream and to aspire to a world based on consensus, with a focus on the core values of peace, justice, freedom, democracy and solidarity. but that dream was an illusion, because for some time now we have unfortunately been seeing nationalism and inward-looking attitudes resurgent in certain parts of the planet, while freedom and democracy are shrinking in others. we have seen the readiness of certain countries to impose their world view on others. and we are seeing games of rivalry and confrontation play out between powers as they vie for the political, military or economic control of certain parts of the world. simply put, actors in the international community have been brazenly spreading a unipolar and monochromatic world view that reflects their own ideology and interests. we urgently need to regroup and develop the inner strength to refrain from succumbing to those temptations. let us instead emphasize a spirit of solidarity that is aimed at preserving our worlds diversity and realizing the principle of the interdependence of peoples, a world in which everyone can contribute to managing its affairs. burkina faso firmly believes that humankinds chance of survival lies in accepting our differences and diversity and using them resourcefully. far from being a source of antagonism or hostility, our differences and diversity represent an excellent opportunity to find complementarity and solidarity a way of encouraging peaceful coexistence and sustainable development that costs us nothing. the key challenges facing our world today are well known to everyone. they include primarily peace and security, democracy and sustainable development, climate change and environment and health and education. i want to emphasize that the only way we can meet those challenges is by working together. that is why we must try to extend our concerns beyond our individual and private interests, which are often factors in crises, in order to maintain peaceful relations with one another. i therefore call earnestly on all the actors of the international community, whether they are from the north or the south and regardless of the political, economic or military power they have, to take that approach. certain issues have recurred on the general assemblys plenary agenda for several years now, including palestine, the western sahara, debt, climate change, the embargo on cuba, the war in ukraine and security council reform. in order to resolve each of those issues, on behalf of burkina faso i strongly recommend that we respected the rule of law, champion justice and equity and let common sense lead the way. i would now like to say a few words about the situation in my country and the aim of the political transition currently under way, in connection with the general assemblys very relevant theme this session and the goals of the charter of the united nations. on 24 january, a group of young patriots felt compelled to take responsibility for the public management of the nations affairs in a natural response to a drift in political governance, growing insecurity in our country and the gradual and continuing disintegration of the state, and they did so by putting an end to a regime that while democratically elected was also mired in chaos. but we have no intention of justifying or promoting destabilizing practices or violating the constitutional order. while the 24 january movement was technically illegal and perhaps contrary to principles dear to the united nations and the international community as a whole, when we consider how things were being handled we believe it was necessary, indeed vital, to disrupt the constitutional order. it was a matter of our nations survival above all. that is why the movement, which is focused on safeguarding the territory and implementing reforms, enjoys genuine popular legitimacy among public opinion in our country, and that enthusiasm and popular support have continued for the transitional authorities, which i have been leading for eight months now. the security situation in burkina faso began to deteriorate in 2015, before reaching a low point in 2020 and 2021. the recent events that disrupted my countrys march towards democracy have resulted from a failure to respond appropriately to the security crisis, as well as terrible political governance, which among other things led to the largest number of internally displaced persons in the political history of our country and subregion 1,520,012 people as of 31 august. we are also facing a humanitarian and food crisis unprecedented in the countrys history, as well as the closure of several thousand schools, with half a million students deprived of education, and economic stagnation induced by the slowdown, if not total halt, in economic activity in a number of industries such as mining, tourism and hotels, as well as agriculture and livestock farming and transportation. those difficulties, which i have touched on briefly, are part of a wider subregional security context of attacks perpetrated by various terrorist groups operating in the sahel, particularly in its centre, which includes burkina faso, mali and the niger. nevertheless, in order to deal with this, the transitional government, relying largely on new internal initiatives, has shouldered its responsibilities by developing an action plan based on four strategic objectives combating terrorism and restoring territorial integrity, responding to the humanitarian crisis, rebuilding the state and improving governance and ensuring national reconciliation and social cohesion. in order to achieve those objectives, we have launched some major initiatives. the first is to restructure our national security apparatus and to take firm and vigorous action on the ground to combat terrorism and armed groups. the second is to combat radicalization, hate speech and the stigmatization of communities. the third is to implement a policy of de-radicalization and social and professional reintegration for reformed combatants from armed groups. the fourth is to support the resettlement and socioeconomic integration of internally displaced persons and those affected by terrorism. lastly, we aim to combat corruption and promote justice, equity and education for peace and for our citizens. however, burkina fasos will and determination alone in combating terrorism will not be enough to make a long-lasting impact. the support of the international community is both crucial and expected, and it is particularly urgent for burkina faso, whose geographic position makes it a buffer zone for curbing the spread of terrorism to countries on the coast such as benin, cote divoire, ghana and togo. ensuring stability, security and peace in the sahel is not just a matter of concern for the countries of our region because the current situation in the sahel countries, needless to say, is the result of terrorisms migration from north africa towards the south. the current situation in the sahel, a result of that cross-border impact, is a problem that is jeopardizing international peace and security. it is therefore important for the international community to understand it better and be more involved. the efforts that have been made so far are certainly welcome, but they fall short of what is needed, given the reality on the ground. in that context, i welcome the initiative that the chairperson of the african union and the secretary-general of the united nations have taken to mandate the former president of the niger mahamadou issoufou to lead the joint african union-united nations independent high-level panel on security and development in the sahel, which should produce recommendations on how to strengthen the international response to the security crisis in the sahel with a view to finding a comprehensive and lasting solution. i appeal to our bilateral and multilateral technical and financial partners to support the transition action plan we adopted on 6 may. burkina faso is hoping for their support in order to close a gap of approximately $4.5 billion out of a total budget of about $18 billion. the government has also begun developing an emergency transition programme, which will be devoted to priority projects, as well as innovative projects and others expected to significantly benefit peoples living conditions. we are therefore counting on our friends and partners to mobilize support to that end. the transition authorities in burkina faso are aware of their responsibilities to our people and their duty to the international community, and i want to make it clear that we will not abandon those responsibilities. in that regard, on 3 july we agreed to a dynamic compromise with the economic community of west african states on the duration of the transition, which was set at 24 months from 1 july, and on the need to set up a transitional monitoring and evaluation mechanism based on indicators relating to security, the restoration of government services to the occupied areas and the return of displaced persons. i firmly believe that achieving significant progress in those three areas will help create the conditions for holding credible and transparent elections with a view to a return to a normal constitutional order. such progress can be achieved only with the substantial support of the international community, for which i urge wholeheartedly from this rostrum today. i would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our bilateral, multilateral and private technical and financial partners who are supporting us or have promised to do so. i would also like to invite those that have not yet done so to join us and support us as we strive to rebuild and strengthen the economic, social and security fabric of the country. the peoples of our planet, rich or poor, powerful or weak, need a secure and peaceful world in which all can live in peace and fully exercise their rights. the sahel is currently riddled with armed groups that are causing devastation all over the globe. they threaten the security both of the region and the rest of the world. if nothing is decisively and urgently done to help our countries, we may see terrorism flare up in the countries of the gulf of guinea and then the rest of the world starting with europe, the continent closest to africa. nor will any precautionary or preventive measure be able to prevent terrorism from spreading to the other side of the atlantic if the sahel is left to its fate. and as long as the young people of the sahel and neighbouring countries no longer have hope in their own lands, nothing will be able to prevent them from attempting the perilous migration to europe via the sahara and the mediterranean. against the backdrop of terrorism-inflicted misery in the region, the sahel has become a stage for futile rivalries and shameful greed, which make the situation even worse. the countries of the sahel deserve better than this and need solidarity and help but not just any help. we need help that enables us to no longer ask for help the kind that will make our need for help obsolete. and we need it to be consistent with our beliefs and to respect our dignity. i would like to conclude my remarks by urging all the actors of the international community to show greater solidarity with one another, because that is the best way to address the challenges of our time and preserve the interests of all. raoul follereau said that no one has the right to be happy all by themselves. let us therefore make sure that there are no more malnourished children without education or instruction; that there are no more young people without training or jobs; that there are no more peasants without land to live in dignity; that there are no more workers whose rights are trampled; that the abundance of some is not the cause of the destitution of others; that force does not prevail over truth and justice; and finally, that the reasons of our selfishness never prevail over the demands of the dignity of humankind and peoples. i vow that burkina faso will spare no effort to make its contribution to the building of a better, peaceful, united and prosperous world.",Burkina Faso,Africa,34.4900016784668,5.294567533042409,2328.0,14.0,0.0,14.0,6.013745704467354
MDG,77,2022,"at the outset, allow me to address mr. korosi, director of environmental sustainability at the office of the president of hungary. his election as president of the general assembly at its seventy-seventh session sends a clear message about the road mapped out for us by this annual meeting of the united nations. i offer him my sincere congratulations. i would also like to warmly commend the secretary-general for his ongoing commitment and dedication at the helm of the united nations. on behalf of the people of madagascar, i would also like to take the opportunity provided by this forum to reiterate our deepest condolences to the british people. queen elizabeth ii inspired several generations in her country and all over the world. i also want to congratulate his majesty king charles iii and wish him good health and a blessed reign. the annual meeting of the general assembly is always an opportunity to highlight the aspiration that unites us, that is, universal peace. now that we have learned to live with the coronavirus disease (covid-19), which we have discussed at length over the past two years, we are still facing the consequences of the crisis, despite everything. it has shown us that it is at the most difficult times that we realize the importance of solidarity among nations. the theme of this session, a watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges, is very apt. it gives us new hope, reassures us and gives us new hope that we can advance together along the path of development. when we had to tackle the health crisis, we chose to put our trust in our scientists and in the wealth of earths natural resources. the establishment of the pharmalagasy pharmaceutical plant, at the height of the health crisis, demonstrated that we could turn difficulties into opportunities in order to exploit our biodiversity and thereby protect our population. while we predicted the apocalypse for africa, madagascars infection and death rates are among the lowest in the world. we have been classified as a green zone, meaning a country with low risks of infection. at the moment no pcr tests or health certificates are required to enter madagascar. we beat the statistics and emerged from the crisis stronger, and above all, more committed to ensuring our countrys development. the world was just beginning to recover from the pandemic when new crises emerged. no country was spared the effects of covid-19, and the conflict in ukraine has worsened instability and heightened inequalities. that is yet another major obstacle to our efforts to achieve resilience and post-covid recovery. like every other country in the world, we are experiencing the full inflationary effects of this crisis. we firmly believe that all wars end around the table. dialogue is the only way to bring about peace. madagascar therefore reiterates its call for dialogue to resolve the conflict, because its effects are global and becoming more burdensome by the day. developing nations such as ours are feeling and paying the price. the crucial role of the united nations must be to encourage multilateralism in order to find equitable solutions that take into account the strengths and weaknesses of every country and its people. how can we accept the fact that in this time of crisis, countries with gross domestic product (gdp) per capita of more than $100,000 and others with per capita gdp of less than $600 are buying barrels of oil in the same market and at the same price? our organization should take measures to support low-income countries so that they can benefit from and supply themselves with oil at equitable prices, given that the current global situation is a source of major upheaval in a number of countries. some states are now affected by instability. the social fabric is unravelling, and economies are increasingly fragile. some states have been forced to raise fuel prices by 50 per cent, which has resulted in riots and socioeconomic disturbances. recovery is a concern that we all share. our solidarity is the only way we can heal our societies, revive our economies, support growth and establish peace. every country has now had to review its development strategies, and that has emphasized how essential it is for each of us to accelerate industrialization and become self-sufficient. we continue to believe that we should produce and process everything that our populations need domestically. there are weapons more powerful than bombs, tanks and missiles, which are our lands, our raw materials, our natural resources and our people. local industrialization, agricultural innovation and leadership are our ammunition in the work of strengthening ourselves and our armour in order to protect our peoples. in madagascar, we have developed a detailed strategy to make up for the delays our development has suffered. we developed our 2019-2023 madagascar emergency plan and began to implement it when i took office as president in 2019. our vision is clear and reflected in our political will, which we have demonstrated through all of our actions. we have prioritized a sector- and project-based approach in order to raise madagascars classification to that of a newly emerging country. we have launched an ambitious set of reforms to modernize our administration, develop our human capital and foster strong, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, with energy as the driving force of its development. madagascar is a country that is blessed with water resources for hydroelectric dams, a high number of sunshine hours for solar power plants and wind power for wind farms. many countries are facing energy problems today, and we must therefore accelerate our renewable energy production so that we can achieve self-sufficiency in the next five years. we intend to double or even triple our energy production capacity. it is 2022. regrettably, africa is still a continent where most families live in darkness and obscurity. more than 600 million africans, including 85 per cent of malagasy households, still use candles and oil lamps to light their homes. that is why we are launching a major operation to equip most malagasy homes with solar kits by the end of next year, with some of them, of course, subsidized by the state. in achieving that, madagascar intends to be the first or one of the first countries on the african continent to have brought light to all its people. climate change is one of the major challenges of our time and one that we all have to tackle. it is important and urgent that we mobilize our joint efforts to protect our planet. i would like to raise the alarm here about commitments that were made at the twenty- first conference of the parties (cop) to the united nations framework convention on climate change and reaffirmed at cop26, regarding the creation of the green climate fund, which was supposed to be funded annually in the amount of $100 billion. madagascar was the fifth african country to complete its national adaptation plan, and my country therefore should have been a beneficiary of the fund. however, the access to funding is slow and so far none of the commitments have been upheld. it is unfair that the least-polluting nations should pay the highest price for the impact of climate change. madagascar is an island and therefore vulnerable to climate hazards. this year alone, five cyclones struck the island in the space of just two months. some 178,000 hectares of arable land were flooded and destroyed. our island is the first country to have endured a climate-induced famine. water resources are drying up in the south of the country and the people in that area are the most vulnerable on the island. the effects of climate change are worsening. the global situation is calling us to action. how many high-level meetings, summits and international conferences have we already had? how many statements and commitments have we made? now we have to transform our words into actions. today i am relaying the cries and the voices of the african continent in general and madagascar in particular. africas young people and indeed the entire continent are waiting for polluting countries to comply with the agreements they have made. keeping those promises will protect our planet. our populations demand that those promises be kept, and future generations will hold us accountable later. environmental protection issues are particularly dear to my heart. we all know that forests are the lungs of the earth, and yet the use of charcoal and firewood remains standard practice across the african continent, including by 92 per cent of the population of my country. a family using charcoal or firewood for cooking destroys approximately one hectare of forest every year, which is devastating. we must change the practice and the mindset. that is why madagascar will equip 250,000 families with bioethanol stoves with the aim of preserving 250,000 hectares of our forest every year. we have started major public works projects to transform the country because everything needs to be built or rebuilt. everything is urgent, and everything is a priority. for the past almost four years, we have been constantly building and repairing roads. we have built schools, health centres, hospitals, dams, courts, prisons in line with international standards, sporting and cultural facilities and much more. and madagascar is continually evolving, despite the successive global crises. ours is a large country and considerable work has been done to ensure that all areas are accessible. however, the road is still a long and winding one. but we have faith, and we will continue to move forward with determination. the madagascar emergency plan is literally paving the way for the future. from north to south and east to west, all of madagascar is under construction. only last week we opened our state highway 5a in the north of the country, which until now had for decades been a dirt road that took a week to traverse in the rainy season. now it takes only two hours. it has led to an immediate reduction in the costs of the transportation and movement of goods and people, considerably improving the lives of the local communities and contributing to socioeconomic development in my countrys northern regions. in the south of the country, we are starting work on state highway 13 and will soon do the same for highways 10 and 44 in the east, thereby facilitating access to madagascars main granary. in the north-west, state highway 31, which is currently under reconstruction, will be entirely restored, which will mean that we will have access to our second largest agricultural area. in a few weeks we will be starting work on the countrys first major highway, which will link the capital to our largest port. once the work is completed, the journey will be shortened from 10 hours to only two and a half. the demographic dividend is a variable that we have to include in our equation. we must change the structure of our population. our current demographic growth is not commensurate with our economic growth. in some areas, girls under the age of 18 are already mothers of families who on average have to care for between five and eight children. it is therefore harder for them to feed and properly raise, care for and educate those children. our family planning programme, which has already been launched, is therefore a crucial part of our strategy for controlling our birth rate and transforming the current population from one that is dependent to one that is employed and economically productive. our demography in madagascar will be an asset to our development and no longer an obstacle to it. with regard to education, we have made great strides. my government has built more than 1,000 classrooms and has made huge investments in teaching tools and material. we have set up school canteens. we have published books and textbooks and distributed tablets so as to considerably improve the quality of education received by our children and young people. access to basic education has increased by 146 per cent and the school dropout rate has significantly decreased. we have made education a national priority, and we reiterate our commitment to transforming and revitalizing schools and universities. last year, i had the opportunity to speak (a/76/ pv.6, p.7) about my countrys wish to finally see the implementation of resolutions adopted by the general assembly in 1979 (resolution 34/91) and 1980 (resolution 35/123), concerning the return and administration of the indian ocean lies eparses or nosy malagasy to madagascar. we welcome the upcoming second meeting of the joint french-malagasy commission on the subject, and based on those two resolutions, which confirm the legitimacy of our claim, we hope to have the support of the united nations in finally reaching a fair, settled and peaceful solution. during the pandemic, the sick needed oxygen to survive. many countries are currently still struggling to breathe, thanks to the effects of successive crises. they need the oxygen they require to breathe in the form of support, aid and assistance, which will help them tackle the challenges of socioeconomic recovery and achieve the sustainable development goals. we must accelerate the pace of the implementation of new financing mechanisms, such as the resilience and sustainability trust, to ensure the disbursement of funding. i would like to take this opportunity to thank the international monetary fund, the world bank and the friendly countries that have always stood with us in the most difficult times. the africa of tomorrow must be autonomous, independent and prosperous. we have a duty to change the history of the continent and to write a new chapter so that each of us and each of our countries can change and be transformed. our organization needs to strengthen its solidarity to provide shared solutions to our common problems. may god bless each of our nations. the homeland is sacred.",Madagascar,Africa,77.4800033569336,3.067728230032039,2308.0,14.0,1.0,15.0,6.499133448873484
TUN,77,2022,"at the outset, i wish to congratulate mr. csaba korosi and his friendly country hungary on presiding over the seventy-seventh session of the general assembly, and offer him tunisias support for the guidelines he has outlined. solidarity, sustainability and science are indeed basic components of the solutions we are looking for. i also extend deep appreciation to mr. abdulla shahid for his capable management of the work of the previous session of the general assembly, against the backdrop of grave challenges whose repercussions are still being felt and unfortunately foretell further difficulties. thanks are due to mr. antonio guterres for his ongoing efforts to strengthen the role of our organization and to ensure an effective response to our challenges and to contain their impacts, especially through the implementation of our common agenda (a/75/982). that agenda, with all its contents, provides a ray of hope for the international community at a time of concerns about our capacity to overcome the consequences of the coronavirus disease (covid-19) pandemic at the health, economic and humanitarian levels. we have found in the agenda and in other united nations references that we have supported and engaged in such as the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction 2015-2030, the paris agreement on climate change and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development a path towards common solutions within a framework of solidarity and parity so that no one is left behind. unfortunately, however, many peoples today are threatened to be left behind as a result of international financial structural imbalances and limited international solidarity amid exacerbated risks and threats of disputes, conflicts, political crises and unprecedented natural disasters due to climate change, in addition to the terrible flows of irregular migration and the increase in the number of refugees, not to mention the millions of people threatened by famine, malnutrition and extreme poverty. at a time when we were trying to overcome the repercussions of covid-19 and its devastating effects, which will be felt for many years to come, the russian- ukrainian crisis has returned us to a state of uncertainty. indeed, the world today is facing a severe food and energy crisis as a result of the disruption of production and supply chains, shortages of basic materials, unprecedented high food prices, the deterioration of purchasing power, and high rates of inflation, debt and debt servicing. today we are indeed facing a defining moment in our history and common destiny that calls on all of us to find radical and transformative solutions that will allow our peoples to overcome the current circumstances, enhance our resilience and build the sustainability we hope for. our peoples are watching us at this session and wondering whether the international community is truly capable of implementing transformative solutions and whether we have the political will to address the global crises that are escalating and accumulating. at each session, new issues are added to the old ones, so are we simply postponing todays solutions until they become tomorrows problems? are we assuming our responsibility for the future of coming generations? todays solutions must protect us from tomorrows crises, and those solutions cannot be formulated within traditional policies and approaches. in this context, tunisia stresses once again that circumstantial solutions to certain issues do not fundamentally resolve them, but are merely palliatives. over the decades, such remedies have proven unable to provide radical and effective solutions to various crises. we need new policies based on solidarity and justice, such as those contained in the secretary-generals report our common agenda. the repercussions of the covid-19 pandemic and the consequences of the situation in ukraine have revealed the need to review those approaches so that we can save the 2030 sustainable development goals before it is too late, as indicated by the secretary-general. in that context, i would like to emphasize the following. first, solutions cannot be formulated outside the framework of multilateral action and human solidarity, and in cooperation and coordination with the united nations, while preserving the other frameworks and mechanisms as tributaries for that cooperation. they complement and complete such coordination, without competing with it or weakening its ability to provide solutions. that is what tunisia emphasized recently on the occasion of our countrys hosting, on 27 and 28 august, the eighth tokyo international symposium on development in africa, where we discussed many items on our agenda, including how to achieve sustainable development through approaches in which economic, security and humanitarian dimensions are integrated. secondly, we need to adopt an economic approach that focuses on the quality of economic growth and not its speed, especially by investing more in knowledge, science, innovation and modern technologies. in tunisia, we look forward to the francophonie summit, which will be hosted on the island of djerba on 19 and 20 november, under the theme connectivity in diversity: digital as a vector of development and solidarity in the francophonie space. the recommendations of the summit should promote ways to achieve our common goals in the digital, technological and development fields. thirdly, we must take a qualitative leap in debt management through new development approaches and in how the global financial system can provide financial support without unfair conditions or dicta that do not take into account the specificities and circumstances of developing and least developed countries, especially in the african region, where the global financial system has not offered the support they expected in their efforts to overcome the existing challenges and in their quest for recovery and the achievement of the sustainable development goals. that was confirmed by the secretary-general recently when he spoke of a disruptive global financial system that disappoints developing countries. in that context, tunisia calls for a restructuring of debt into investment projects to generate wealth. it also stresses the importance of enabling peoples to recover their looted funds that were smuggled abroad. fourthly, the international community must today renew its commitment to the african continent on the basis of solidarity, equality and equal partnership, while listening to its development and security concerns. fifthly, the challenges facing the world today cannot be addressed without consolidating the elements of international peace and security, based on the rule of international law and international legitimacy. in that context, it is necessary to work on settling conflicts peacefully without selectivity, putting an end to absurd conflicts, refraining from fabricating crises and finding solutions to just causes, foremost of which is the palestinian question, which requires an end of the occupation and the establishment of an independent palestinian state, with jerusalem as its capital. sixthly, we must realize that every country, without exception, has its own challenges, problems and peculiarities. there is no one-size-fits-all mode or model. let us agree that there are principles, values and common denominators that unite us and that we are all obligated to respect, but the details of choices and directions remain within the sovereign purviews of states. there is no democracy, but there are democracies. democracy in tunisia represents an unshakable national option, which we are working to strengthen and preserve through a corrective path whose phases will be completed by the legislative elections of 17 december. tunisias democratic choice arises from the will of the tunisian people, who are determined to make their democratic experience a success and complete their political path under the auspices of a state that preserves their constitutional rights, freedoms, security and dignity, in which the law is supreme and the people are sovereign. tunisia has demonstrated in various regional and international forums its adherence to human rights and freedoms with further support and development. it has contributed to enriching the united nations system in that regard with several initiatives and contributions that are recognized for their credibility and sustained, firm alignment with common universal principles. the stakes before us today can be addressed only with a true common resolve to go beyond the diagnosis stage to the action and response stage through the optimal utilization of our capabilities and capabilities and by activating multilateral action. our peoples are tired of unfulfilled promises, so let us all rise to that defining moment and rebuild trust in our national and international institutions so as to move towards achieving our common goals of building a better world for us and for future generations, a world that is worthy of human beings wherever they are, while preserving their security and dignity and realizing their well-being and sustainability.",Tunisia,Africa,83.5599975585938,6.804989607392803,1398.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,2.8612303290414878
