Mr President,  
Excellencies, Heads of State and Government,  
Mr Secretary-General of the United Nations,  
Distinguished Delegates,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

The history of the United Nations is one of trust in collective responses to the gravest crises. Yet we all recognise that today we stand at a crossroads:  
- On the one hand, our multilateral model and ageing institutions are no longer capable of responding to new challenges—challenges that are, let us agree, unprecedented in their complexity;  
- On the other hand, our multilateral discussions and commitments in recent years often remain mere words on paper.  

There are thus real grounds for concern when we look to the future:  
- Concern for the future of our planet, which is gripped by complex crises.  
- Concern for the future of our youth, given the burdens it inherits (especially environmental challenges).  
- Concern, finally, for the future of our institutions, which have failed to adapt to contemporary realities and no longer fulfil their promises.  

We have no choice: we cannot persist with systems that struggle to deliver on their promises and no longer reflect the realities of today’s world. We must commit to deep transformation. It is in this spirit that I appear before you today—with conviction and a clear vision for the future:  
- My conviction is that another path is possible: a path in which international cooperation is revitalised, becoming more inclusive and more respectful.  
- My vision is of an Africa that fully assumes its role as a strategic partner in shaping the new rules of global governance.  

**My first observation** is that my country, Togo, looks to the future with hope and determination.

In Togo, we are working towards a development that must be sustainable, but also equitable and inclusive. For this, we know we must build a strong, visionary, and protective state. We do so as a nation, because it is our responsibility to current and future generations.  
- This involves massive investment in our education and health systems.  
- It requires bridging the digital divide.  
- It also means committing to ecological transition and gender equality.  

**My second observation** is that to look to the future today is to look towards Africa.

Our continent is no longer merely a developing region; it is quite simply the next engine of global growth.  
- Because Africa is, and will long remain, home to the world’s youth. It holds the greatest potential for development in emerging markets tied to technological innovation and entrepreneurship.  
- Because in Africa, both the green and blue economies offer tremendous opportunities for sustainable development.  

Our continent is rich in natural resources. If properly managed, these resources can transform Africa into a global hub for clean and renewable energy.  
- Africa must also be the space where we pilot new models of partnership—particularly between the public and private sectors.  

**My third observation** is that addressing today’s challenges requires effective multilateral cooperation.

Food, security, and ecological challenges exceed the capacity of individual nations to manage alone. These are fundamentally asymmetric crises that quickly and severely impact regions that are not directly responsible for their causes. That is why I restate here my deep conviction:  
- First, in the face of these global threats, there is no better future for present and future generations than in collective and coordinated action by our states.  
- Second, this collective action must take place within renewed global political frameworks.  

This is especially true in our efforts to adapt to and build resilience against climate change.

Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, even though we contribute the least to greenhouse gas emissions.  
The harmful effects of climate change in Africa—in terms of food security and migratory consequences—can no longer be underestimated. If we do not act, environmental issues will trigger major waves of migration to the Global North, which clearly makes this a shared concern.  

The need for collective action also applies to the challenge of peace and security.

This challenge, too, can no longer be the burden of Africans alone.  

In West Africa, we face persistent terrorist threats. In my view, the response must involve a combination of inclusive dialogue, security reforms, and economic development initiatives to eradicate the root causes of violence.  

But we will not solve all these challenges alone. Multilateral cooperation is necessary to confront this collective threat.  

We all know that development, climate transition, and security must be addressed multilaterally. But to do so, we must first reinvent our model of international cooperation. And this leads me to my final observation:

**There will be no strengthened international cooperation without a new model of partnership—one that is more equitable and more respectful of African states.**

We urgently need to reinvent multilateralism to better balance efforts in international cooperation. In this context, our continent—Africa—deserves particular attention.  
- Above all, there must be greater respect and dignity for African states on the international stage.  

It is time to recognise that we are fully-fledged strategic actors, capable of making meaningful contributions to global efforts for peace, sustainable development, and human dignity.  

Respect for human dignity is not merely a principle that should guide our daily actions within our borders.  
The respect and dignity of our peoples must be recognised through their representation and—above all—the importance accorded to their voices, which must be expressed and respected in international fora.  

- Furthermore, we need a new model of international cooperation grounded in localisation.  
Externally imposed “universal” solutions may have some merit, but they have only partially proven effective.  

Despite recent efforts, international aid often remains disconnected from the needs and capacities of the people it is meant to benefit.  
Localisation must become a deep commitment to recognising local expertise, allowing states to play their role in setting priorities and implementing programmes.  

Togo is determined to be a leading actor in this transformation. I call upon all international partners to support a fairer and more respectful model of cooperation.  

**Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,**  
Africa is ready—ready to play the role it deserves on the international stage.  
But it also seeks to be respected, heard, and equitably supported in its efforts.  

Together, let us work to build a world in which every nation and every individual can live with dignity, in harmony with one another and with our planet.

Thank you.
