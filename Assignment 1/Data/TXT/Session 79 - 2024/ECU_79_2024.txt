**Mr President of the General Assembly,**  
**Distinguished Representatives,**

I begin by conveying greetings from the President of the Republic of Ecuador, **Daniel Noboa Azín**—a young leader who has had the resolve to break with the patterns that prevented the changes demanded by his generation and by my country.

Ecuador is a nation of 18 million people, with enormous potential. Its youth fight every day for a better future, seeking to transform the reality they inherited.

They believed in the transformative project proposed by President Noboa. Today, they see a country of opportunity and progress, grounded in respect for human rights and firmly committed to eradicating corruption and impunity.

**Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen,**

Even when it seems that global and multidimensional crises surpass us, **international law** and the **purposes and principles of the UN Charter** must remain our guiding compass.

Ecuador reaffirms its commitment to:
- **Multilateralism**  
- **Peace and sustainable development**  
- **The peaceful resolution of disputes**  
- **Respect for individual freedoms and human rights**

In short, Ecuador remains steadfast in upholding the ideals and principles that gave life to the United Nations.

We must implement the **Pact for the Future**, the **Global Digital Compact**, and the **Declaration for Future Generations**, all adopted last week.

This will help the UN cease to be a photograph taken 79 years ago and instead reflect the reality of the contemporary world.

Ecuador welcomes all initiatives that promote inclusive prosperity and democracy, recognising that their sustainability is intrinsically tied to the peace of nations, because there is an **inseparable link between peace and development**.

This is why Ecuador is committed to the **Sustainable Development Goals** and has demonstrated that the much-needed **Goal 16 – Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions**—generates synergies and is interconnected with 125 of the 169 targets of the 2030 Agenda.

Let us be clear: when we strengthen democracy and institutional frameworks, we combat violence in all its forms.  
By tackling corruption, we achieve greater justice and peace for our citizens.

We impact economic recovery and the creation of quality jobs. We reduce poverty, hunger, and malnutrition.

**Security / Transnational Organised Crime**

**Mr President,**

Building a future of greater prosperity and peace requires confronting **transnational organised crime** and **narcotrafficking**, which undermine institutions and corrode the social fabric of our democracies.

In December 2023, during Ecuador’s presidency of the **Security Council**, President Noboa warned members about a wave of transnational organised and narco-terrorist crime threatening the rule of law, state control, and border security.

Faced with this challenge, the national government has made responsible decisions and leads a relentless fight that past administrations avoided.

However, national actions alone are insufficient. Organised crime operates with resources far exceeding those dedicated to combatting it.

Only by deepening international cooperation and working in a **coordinated and effective** manner can we defeat it.

**Security Council**

As an **elected member** of the **Security Council**, Ecuador has demonstrated its commitment to international peace and security.

We have lived up to this historic responsibility with consciousness and resolve, even amid **geopolitical tensions between major powers** that restrict the Council’s collective ability to act in response to conflicts that threaten humanity.

On **Ukraine**, we have been co-penholders of the humanitarian file.  
On **Palestine**, we have voted in favour of all Council resolutions aiming to stop hostilities, release hostages, ensure the proper flow of humanitarian aid, and uphold **international humanitarian law**.

In our own region, we led the authorisation of the **Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) to Haiti**, through **Resolution 2699** (October 2023), just recently renewed through 2025.

The role of **CARICOM** has been instrumental in supporting **Kenya** as the lead nation for the MSS.

This is a first step towards enabling the sister Republic of Haiti to find its path to peace and sustainable development.

**Mr President, Excellencies, Colleagues,**

Until the end of our term, we will continue to honour the commitment we made to this Assembly—elected with 190 votes—to promote:

- The **strengthening and maintenance of peace**  
- Adherence to the **UN Charter**, prioritising **peaceful dispute settlement, diplomacy, and dialogue**  
- **Civilian protection** as the best way to honour the 75th anniversary of the **Geneva Conventions**  
- The fight against **transnational organised crime and terrorism**  
- **Non-proliferation** and the **combating of illicit arms trafficking**  
- The **Women, Peace and Security Agenda**, to eliminate barriers to women’s participation and leadership in the full peace cycle

Additionally, Ecuador has made a **permanent contribution to UN peacekeeping operations**, deploying military personnel to several missions, and supporting initiatives to strengthen them.

Notably, during our presidency of the Security Council, we helped adopt **Resolution 2719 (2023)**, paving the way for **sustainable funding** of **African Union Peace and Security Council-authorised missions**.

**Democracy and Venezuela**

This brings me to another major challenge in **Latin America**: preserving the **rule of law** and **respect for the will of the people**.

The escalating crisis in **Venezuela**—including systematic human rights violations, persecution of political leaders, and daily violent repression of citizens by a totalitarian regime—constitutes a direct threat to regional stability and potentially to international peace and security.

The critical humanitarian, economic, political, rights, and security situation has forced **7.7 million Venezuelans to flee** in search of better opportunities.

Many have found refuge across Latin America, including in **Ecuador**, which hosts the **largest per capita Venezuelan population** in the region.

In the face of this ongoing, grave and complex crisis, **Ecuador has taken a leadership role** and will not relent in its advocacy within international forums for a **peaceful and democratic transition** led by Venezuelans themselves.

The international community must respond clearly and decisively.

**Migration**

**Mr President,**

Migration is one of the most **complex and urgent** challenges facing the world today.

Behind **irregular migration** are networks of **human trafficking** and **migrant smuggling** that endanger millions—particularly **unaccompanied minors** and **women**, who are the most vulnerable.

This is intolerable. Combating it requires **joint and coordinated action** with a **comprehensive approach**.

Ecuador experiences **all dimensions of migration**: country of origin, destination, transit, return, and refuge.

We therefore advocate for **safe, orderly and regular migration** in all its forms. This requires **strong support from the international community**, which must understand that such goals are only achievable by **avoiding the criminalisation of migration**.

---

**Environment / Climate Change**

The international community must also unite to confront the **devastating effects of climate change**.

Ecuador is currently experiencing **its worst drought in decades**.

This highlights the importance of protecting ecosystems and investing in infrastructure to respond effectively.

As a **megadiverse country**, home to fragile ecosystems like the **Amazon**, the **Andes**, and the **Galápagos Islands**, we are committed to **biodiversity conservation**.

We are updating our **National Biodiversity Strategy** and implementing an **ecological transition policy** to preserve our natural heritage.

These efforts require **greater shared responsibility** from the international community, especially in terms of **finance**, **technology transfer**, **capacity-building**, and **scientific research**, which currently remain inadequate.

The **Paris Agreement** and the principle of **common but differentiated responsibilities** must not be undermined—they must be **strengthened**.

Ecuador also supports initiatives for **ocean protection, conservation and sustainable use**, including the **prompt entry into force** of the **Agreement on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction** and the success of the **Third UN Ocean Conference** in 2025.

Our commitment is also reflected in Ecuador’s leadership of the committee tasked with developing a **legally binding instrument to eliminate plastic pollution**.

We hope this agreement will be finalised soon, and that **Galápagos**, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, will serve as the **signing venue** for this instrument.

**Closing**

**Mr President,**

Security, transnational organised crime, and climate change are some of the **key challenges** facing humanity today. They demand expanded use of **global cooperation mechanisms** and **development financing**.

Ecuador believes in the urgent need to **transform global governance** and its institutions to restore their **legitimacy** and avoid their **irrelevance**.

This includes both the **Bretton Woods institutions** and the **United Nations** itself.

Improving the UN system’s organs is not an end in itself, but a means to achieve the greater goal: **peace and security in the world**.

To that end, a **stronger and more effective Security Council** must be matched by a **modern and effective General Assembly**.

We must reaffirm this Assembly’s central role while the **Security Council is reformed**.

Ecuador recognises that it is a **non-permanent member** whose term ends in December 2024, and also knows that **elected members**, when united, play a **fundamental role**.

We must continue down this path.

An essential component of transformation is the **participation of women in leadership positions**.

Ecuador reaffirms its support for a **female Secretary-General from Latin America and the Caribbean** to lead the UN.

In conclusion, let me underscore that **crises are overcome through political will, leadership, and the courage to make the right decisions.**

This will only be achieved by **strengthening multilateralism**, not weakening it.

In this way, we can realise our shared dream of a **more just, peaceful, and opportunity-filled world for all.**

**Thank you very much.**
