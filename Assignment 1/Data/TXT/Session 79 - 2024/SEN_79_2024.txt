Mr President of the General Assembly,  
Ladies and Gentlemen, Heads of State and Government,  
Mr Secretary-General,  
Distinguished Delegates,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

Allow me first to congratulate Mr Philémon Yang on his election as President of this 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly, and to commend his predecessor for his contribution to the implementation of our common agenda. Through you, I express my best wishes for success in guiding our work. I also warmly commend the unwavering commitment of Secretary-General António Guterres, whose efforts to promote peace, human dignity and multilateralism are more necessary than ever.  
Senegal renews its full support for his mission in these times of major global turbulence.

In addressing you today, I am animated by a deep conviction: unity in diversity is the key to securing peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for all, everywhere in the world. The theme of this session, which guides our deliberations, invites us to rethink our collective responsibilities and ensure that the founding principles of the United Nations, defined nearly eight decades ago, continue to carry the promise of a more just and equitable world.

Mr President,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  

We live in a troubled world, where the principles of the United Nations Charter—equality, justice, and respect for human rights—are under daily threat. Conflicts are spreading, inequalities are deepening, and climate crises are exacerbating the vulnerability of millions of people worldwide.  
Moreover, we are witnessing a troubling erosion of multilateralism, at a time when humanity needs it most.

The world must take a hard look at itself. The values we have sworn to uphold are being trampled in several regions of the globe. Whether one is in Gaza, Tel Aviv, Dakar or elsewhere, every human being bears the same inherent dignity—a dignity that transcends borders, cultures, and religious affiliations. It is our shared duty to ensure that this dignity is protected and respected for every person, without exception. That duty is the very essence of the United Nations.

And yet we see, day after day, that international law—the cornerstone of global peace—is often violated. Resolutions adopted by this very Assembly are ignored. By tolerating these repeated violations, we undermine the principles of the UN Charter and corrode the very foundation of this House of peace.

Never have the foundations of the United Nations been so shaken as they are today—by violence, fear and uncertainty. If we truly wish to ward off the spectre of war and build a better world, then it is time to change paradigms. It is time to place the human being back at the centre of the international agenda, as this session’s theme invites us to do.

Mr President,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

We can no longer turn a blind eye to the tragedy unfolding in the Sahel. Terrorist groups are spreading terror, looting, and killing innocent civilians. This region, once stable, is now plagued by daily violence, while the United Nations—and especially the Security Council—too often remain inert.  

Likewise, we cannot accept the Sahel becoming the theatre of foreign power rivalries, the clashes of which only worsen the region’s destabilisation.  

Let me remind this Assembly that the peace and security of Africa are inseparable from global peace. It is imperative that the Security Council fully exercise its role as guarantor of international stability.

I must again express Senegal’s concern at the tragic, ongoing situation in Palestine. Generations have grown up under the shadow of oppression, denied their fundamental right to a viable state.  

Senegal, as Chair of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, calls for an immediate and lasting ceasefire. We reiterate our support for a two-state solution, with East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine, in line with relevant United Nations resolutions.  

This war—targeting women, children, and vital infrastructure—is an open wound on the conscience of the international community. It is imperative that international humanitarian law be re-established in all conflict zones, and that the United Nations fully play its role as mediator and guarantor of peace.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Peace is not merely the absence of war. Peace is also the possibility for every human being to live with dignity—to eat, to have shelter, to be educated, and to access healthcare. Yet today, more than 750 million people go hungry, and millions more fall into extreme poverty each day.  

These figures take us further away from achieving the Sustainable Development Goals set for 2030. We can no longer accept that global governance mechanisms continue to reproduce such inequalities.  

It is time to break with the logic of every nation for itself and to build a new global social contract, based on solidarity and cooperation. This contract must include major reforms to address the political, economic, and environmental challenges of our time.

**Firstly**, it is imperative to safeguard and strengthen multilateralism as the sole framework for action on international peace and security. This requires urgent reform of global institutions—notably the Security Council, the IMF, and the World Bank—so that they become more inclusive and reflective of current geopolitical and economic realities. The African continent, in particular, must have a greater role in these decision-making bodies.

**Secondly**, we must correct the economic injustices that hinder the development of many countries in the Global South. Unfair trade practices, tax evasion, illicit financial flows, and abusive tax holidays devastate developing countries, particularly in Africa. These injustices must be addressed so that all countries can fully participate in global trade and share in economic growth.

**Thirdly**, we must act decisively to combat climate change, in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Industrialised countries—historical contributors to massive greenhouse gas emissions—must step up their efforts to finance a just and equitable energy transition, one that does not penalise developing countries. We must protect our planet without sacrificing the rights of the most vulnerable nations to pursue their development.

**Fourthly**, we must reject all attempts to impose unilateral civilisational norms. Since its independence, Senegal has always defended the equal dignity of cultures and civilisations. This diversity must remain the foundation for peaceful coexistence among peoples. No nation should impose its practices or values on others as universal norms. Respect for difference is the foundation of peace and stability in the world.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Senegal is firmly committed to this path. We have chosen to build a state resolutely oriented toward sustainable development, with ambitious initiatives in areas such as clean energy, food sovereignty, and transparent governance. But we know that, to succeed, we need collective action and international solidarity.

No country—no matter how powerful—can tackle alone the challenges threatening humanity. We must act together, united in our diversity, to build a future where human dignity is respected, justice prevails, and prosperity is shared. It is through cooperation and mutual respect that we will overcome the crises shaking our world.

I thank you for your kind attention.
