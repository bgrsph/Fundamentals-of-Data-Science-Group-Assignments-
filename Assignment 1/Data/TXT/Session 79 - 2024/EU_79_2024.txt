Mr President of the General Assembly,  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  

When one enters this building, the eye is drawn to a blue-hued light. It comes from the *Stained Glass Window for Peace*. It is dedicated to those who have served the United Nations. This window was created by Marc Chagall—a Russian Jew who spent most of his life in exile, having lived through two world wars.  
To guarantee the peace and global security reclaimed in 1945, the promises of liberty and solidarity were enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.  

This is the tenth consecutive speech I have had the honour of delivering from this podium.  
In my first, in 2015, I listed “the challenges of our generation (...): conflicts, poverty, climate change, migration...”.  
None of these challenges has disappeared. But at the time, we believed we had a framework—the multilateral order—that enabled us to work together on them. Ten years later, that framework is visibly crumbling.  
The use of force and unilateral actions are multiplying. And we are witnessing, with a sense of helplessness, three major conflicts forming an explosive cocktail.

**The Multilateral System in Danger**  

**1. War in Ukraine**  
In Ukraine, it is a permanent member of the Security Council that has launched an illegal and unprovoked war.  
It is an attempt to impose the law of force, rather than the force of law.  
This war is therefore a threat to each of us.  
The European Union will support Ukraine for as long as necessary.  
And, faithful to the promise of liberty and solidarity, we reaffirm our commitment to a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace, which must be based on the United Nations Charter.  

**2. Gaza / Middle East**  
Liberty and solidarity. It is by these same principles that we condemn the heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas. And we demand the release of all hostages.  
Israel has the right to defend itself—within the bounds of international law and the principle of proportionality.  
We call for an immediate ceasefire, in accordance with the order of the International Court of Justice. Every civilian life matters.  
We therefore condemn indiscriminate attacks that harm civilian populations.  
This is a tragedy inflicted upon the Palestinian people.  
The EU is working toward a lasting peace within the framework of a two-state solution, with both states living freely, side by side, and in security.  
This endless escalation must stop. Dragging Lebanon into this spiral is irresponsible.  
Our calls—including to the Israeli government—have so far gone unanswered.  
This cannot go on.  
We support the existence of a democratic, strong State of Israel living in peace alongside the Palestinian people, who must have a viable and stable state of their own.  
But seeking security while neglecting peace is an illusion. There will never be lasting security without peace.  
A world fuelled by vengeance is a less secure world. The Palestinian people have a right to their own state. Denying them this right will endlessly fuel threats to the security of Israelis, and of Jews elsewhere in the world.  
It feeds polarisation everywhere.  
And it undermines a multilateral system that cannot tolerate double standards.  
The policy pursued by Israel is a dead end, and dangerous for all. It must change.  

**3. The War in Sudan**  
The wars in the Middle East and Ukraine must not obscure another major conflict: the civil war in Sudan. A massive humanitarian catastrophe.  
20,000 dead to date, 25 million people in need of emergency assistance, including around 8 million displaced persons. And famine-related deaths projected to reach into the millions.  
External actors are involved in this war, notably through arms supplies. And the entire Horn of Africa is at risk of descending into chaos.  
The EU will continue its efforts to pressure the warring parties—and their supporters—to respect humanitarian and international law. And to end this conflict by implementing a process of reconciliation and peace.

**Ladies and Gentlemen,**  
The life of a child killed in a bombed school is precious—in Ukraine, in Gaza, or elsewhere…  
The violated dignity of a woman raped is sacred—in times of war as in peace, in Sudan, Ukraine, or elsewhere…  
Depriving an entire population of food by blocking humanitarian aid is a war crime—in Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan, or elsewhere…  
A crime is a crime—wherever it occurs, whoever commits it.  
And our indignation is only sincere if it is universal.  
The European Union defends international and humanitarian law with equal vigour—everywhere, and always.  
We condemn acts of destabilisation, regardless of who is responsible.  
I refer to Iran’s support for its proxies that are wreaking havoc and weakening the Middle East.  
And to Iran’s military support for Russia’s war in Ukraine.  
A clear conclusion emerges: Iran and Russia follow the same playbook—nuclear threats, imperialist ambitions, and support for lawless terrorist groups to destabilise their neighbourhoods and beyond.

**Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,**  
The creation of the United Nations and of a rules-based international system was a remarkable step forward.  
To go backwards is to return to war.  
A Third World War is possible. But it must be prevented.  
(Must this really need stating?)  
More than ever since 1945, the world is shaken by a volatile mix of shocks.  
Which accumulate and accelerate.  
We urgently need to come to our senses.  
This demands cooperation—and above all, courage.  
Our shared rules must be respected.  
For that, the United Nations Security Council must free itself from the paralysing straitjacket that the current form of the veto has become.  
The Security Council is not representative.  
And therefore lacks legitimacy.  
Above all, it is ineffective.  
The Security Council is like the living dead.

**Reform or perish!**  
In June 1945, at the adoption of the United Nations Charter, President Truman declared:  
“This Charter (…) will be expanded and improved over time. No one claims it is today a final or perfect instrument. (...) The evolution of global conditions will require adjustments.”  
Decades have passed. The world has changed.  
The adjustments have not taken place.  
The Security Council must be reformed.  
It must become more inclusive. Africa and Latin America must have permanent seats.  
And I propose, without delay, the establishment of practical mechanisms.  
Regional organisations must be better integrated into the United Nations’ decision-making processes.  
They are dynamic instruments for fostering stability and prosperity.  
They already play a key role in shaping and implementing many actions under the *Pact for the Future*—notably in the fields of peace and security, human rights, and sustainable development.  
Finally, regional organisations must participate more systematically in the Security Council.

**Climate, Health, Technological Revolution**  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
There is no freedom when extreme heat ravages our homes with fire.  
There is no freedom when floods devastate our crops.  
There is no freedom when our children are not vaccinated against epidemics.  
Climate change and pandemics have opened our eyes to the necessity of solidarity.  
This is not just a matter of dignity and generosity.  
It is in the interest of developed countries to support climate transition in developing countries.  
And to help them strengthen their health systems.  
It is in this spirit that, together with Dr Tedros in 2020, I launched the idea of an international treaty on pandemics.  
We succeeded in mobilising the international community to negotiate such an agreement. That negotiation is now well advanced. It is time to conclude it.  
The mpox outbreak is another wake-up call, raising again the question of solidarity.  
It is unacceptable that lobbying and selfishness block the essential sharing of vaccines and vaccine technologies.

**Artificial Intelligence and Beyond**  
Dear colleagues,  
There is no freedom in a world where each individual is reduced to their personal data...  
...to a marketing target or a subject of surveillance and manipulation.  
The digital revolution—and its flagship product, artificial intelligence—is an extraordinary engine of progress. A new fuel for prosperity.  
Provided it serves humanity and freedom.  
Let us not repeat the error we made with natural resources by abusing personal data.  
Data and artificial intelligence are instruments of power—potentially of enslavement, or of economic and political domination. And now also weapons of war.  
We must regulate these advances at the global level.  
And while technological competition is healthy—because it promotes progress—it must take place within a commonly agreed framework of fair rules.  
And a global dialogue.  
The European Union is a committed actor in this dialogue—through the G7, its many strategic partnerships, and its fruitful collaboration, right up to recent days, with the G77 countries to advance the *Pact for the Future*.  
We value this dialogue also with partners with whom we do not necessarily share all views.  
In particular with China.  
China is an essential partner in addressing the major global challenges I have mentioned.  
The EU seeks to rebalance its economic relations with China and diversify its supply chains, as excessive dependencies open the door to conflict.  
And we ask China not to support Russia—neither directly nor indirectly—in its illegal war against Ukraine, but to use its influence to uphold the United Nations Charter.

**Global Financial Injustice**  
Excellencies, dear colleagues,  
The international financial architecture must reduce inequalities—not exacerbate them.  
When Kenyan farmers cannot access affordable microcredits to develop their farms and adapt to climate change, this is not a sectoral issue—it is a global development challenge.  
Without sustainable and equitable development, there can be no global stability or security.  
Global development is underfunded.  
The gap between annual investment needs and actual financial resources is vast.  
The Bretton Woods system must undergo deep reform.  
The financial firepower of multilateral development banks must be significantly scaled up—to match the real needs of populations, to combat climate threats, and to advance prosperity.  
Creditor countries must also show greater courage in restructuring debts and reallocating Special Drawing Rights.  

Solidarity is not just about transfers of financial or technological means.  
It is also about governance efforts: improving the business environment, strengthening legal security, and combating corruption to mobilise domestic resources in developing countries.  
As Mo Ibrahim plainly said:  
“While economic aid and development efforts for Africa are wonderful and commendable acts of solidarity, we must change the way our countries are governed.”

**Conclusion**  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  

Allow me to conclude my tenth address from this podium with a few personal reflections.  

**First reflection**:  
Double standards are the contemporary poison of international relations.  
When we defend human dignity, territorial sovereignty, and free and fair elections, we must defend and protect them everywhere and always—[in Afghanistan, Haiti, Hong Kong, Iran, Israel, Myanmar, Palestine, Ukraine, Russia, the DRC, the Sahel, Sudan, Venezuela, Yemen…].  
Each of us must look in the mirror.  
We are all heirs to our histories, cultures, traditions—and our respective mistakes.  
Each must learn their lessons.  
Europe, though at times clumsy, acts sincerely and in good faith so that liberty and human rights are respected everywhere.  

**Second reflection**:  
We must avoid bipolar confrontation and work toward a multipolar world and a multilateral framework—  
—where each country or group of countries chooses its own path to prosper and achieve strategic autonomy,  
—and where all cooperate by following commonly agreed rules.  
Let us resist pressures to choose one camp over another in a bipolar confrontation that can only lead to disaster.  

**Third and final reflection**:  
I deeply believe in cooperation among regional organisations.  
Over the past five years, I have personally invested in the development of the European Union’s partnerships: with the African Union, CELAC, ASEAN, the Gulf Cooperation Council, and Central Asian countries…  
This network of cooperation is a stabilising force and a source of great progress.  
Our Union seeks to be stronger and more autonomous—precisely to enhance its capacity to engage and work with others for peace, liberty, and solidarity in the world.  
A world in which the EU is expected to speak with its own voice.  

**Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,**  
Because our continent bore witness to the greatest tragedy in history on its soil, we Europeans bear a particular responsibility in defending liberty and solidarity—principles which led us to build the European integration project.  
This project represents reconciliation between countries that fought wars for centuries.  
It is proof that reconciliation, then cooperation, then friendship, are always possible—even after the most horrific wars.  
The European Union is a project of hope and optimism.  
And that is why, even today—despite all the excesses, threats, and risks—we are convinced that it is possible to bring the world back toward greater peace, security, and prosperity.  
Peace is never a given. It is fragile.  
Difficult to repair once broken.  
But it is beautiful. Radiant.  
Like Marc Chagall’s stained glass window.  
Let us be the committed actors who strive to preserve this treasure.  

**I thank you.**
