Excellencies,  
Mr President of the General Assembly,  
Mr Secretary-General of the United Nations,  
Distinguished Heads of State and Government,  
Heads of Delegation,  
Honourable Delegates,  
Dear Compatriots,

It is with immense honour that I stand before you today, at a pivotal moment in its history, to represent the dignified and proud people of Haiti at the podium of the United Nations General Assembly. Despite facing storms of all kinds, Haiti—the world’s first Black republic—has always found the strength to rise again. Our nation carries within it the pride of a heroic struggle for liberty and human dignity. Today, we find ourselves at a decisive crossroads. It is with the weight of this history and the hope for a better future that I appeal to you, calling for meaningful solidarity from the international community.

First, allow me to extend my warmest congratulations to His Excellency Mr Philémon Yang, former Prime Minister of Cameroon, on his election as President of this 79th session of the General Assembly. Haiti stands firmly by your side and assures you of its full support throughout your mandate to ensure that this session is a success for the entire international community.

I also wish to pay tribute to the excellent work carried out during the 78th session by your predecessor, His Excellency Mr Dennis Francis of Trinidad and Tobago, who led proceedings with skill, wisdom, and leadership.

Moreover, I take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Haitian people, our heartfelt gratitude to you, Mr Secretary-General António Guterres, for your recent visit to Haiti. Your presence and unwavering support at the Security Council—particularly your efforts to strengthen the Haitian National Police—have been greatly appreciated and will remain etched in our collective memory.

### 2. Gratitude to the International Community

I express my deepest thanks to the international community for the support extended to my country in these times of crisis. Whether through security initiatives, humanitarian aid, or development assistance, this solidarity is highly valued. With continued and better-adapted cooperation, Haiti will emerge stronger and more resilient, confidently advancing towards development and progress.

I salute all Haitians across the world, who, while remaining attached to their homeland, are compelled to seek better opportunities elsewhere. Known for their hard work, I want them to know that the Presidential Transitional Council and the Government are thinking of them, awaiting the day when conditions allow for their return.

I also commend Amnesty International and other human rights organisations that closely monitor violations against Haitian migrants worldwide. I extend fraternal greetings to Haiti’s friends who have shown solidarity, particularly the residents of Springfield, Ohio, in the United States. The long-standing friendship between our two countries, dating back to the Battle of Savannah in 1779, affirms our belief that the American people reject any incitement to hatred against our community.

In this context, let me stress that the passions naturally stirred during an election campaign must never be used as pretexts for xenophobia or racism in a country like the United States—a nation built by immigrants from all backgrounds and a global model of democracy.

### 3. Relevance of the General Debate Theme

Mr President,  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

The theme of this 79th General Assembly—*“No one left behind: peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for present and future generations”*—powerfully resonates with the major challenges the world faces today. It is an urgent call for unity and international cooperation at a time when inequality, conflict, and climate crises increase the vulnerability of millions.

As many countries struggle to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is more necessary than ever to ensure that all voices—especially those of the most marginalised—are heard in global decision-making.

This theme holds profound relevance for Haiti’s current crisis. It captures the essence of our struggle to restore peace and stability while ensuring that every Haitian man and woman enjoys their fundamental rights. Working together, as the theme underscores, is essential for Haiti, for our recovery depends on international solidarity.

### 4. Global Challenges and UN Priorities

Mr President,  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

Our world today faces challenges of unprecedented scale, deeply concerning to the entire international community. The United Nations, in its historic mission to promote peace, security, and sustainable development, stands at the forefront of these crises that threaten not only individual nations but all humanity.

Climate change is undoubtedly one of the gravest threats of our time. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global temperatures have already risen by approximately 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels, resulting in intensified extreme weather events—hurricanes, droughts, and floods—that disproportionately affect vulnerable countries like Haiti.

In 2023, the UNDP estimated that over 100 million additional people could fall into poverty by 2030 due to climate impacts. Although Haiti contributes very little to global greenhouse gas emissions, it bears the brunt of these effects, exacerbating our struggle for food security, access to clean water, and economic stability.

Armed conflicts continue to devastate lives and societies. The UNHCR reports that 110 million people were forcibly displaced in 2023—the highest figure ever recorded. From Syria to Ukraine and the Sahel, prolonged conflicts deepen poverty, destroy vital infrastructure, and fuel mass displacement. The world cannot remain passive as millions flee violence in search of safety and dignity. A renewed international commitment to diplomatic solutions and peacebuilding is more vital than ever.

Economic inequality is another pressing concern. According to the UNDP's 2023 Human Development Report, 1.2 billion people still live in multidimensional poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic further deepened disparities, pushing millions into poverty. For nations like Haiti, the impact has been devastating. Yet these inequalities are not uniquely Haitian—they are global problems demanding global economic reforms.

Food insecurity has also worsened. The FAO reports that over 735 million people suffered from hunger in 2022. Conflicts, economic instability, and climate change drive this alarming trend. In Haiti, nearly half the population now experiences acute food insecurity. This is not only a humanitarian emergency but a threat to national stability. We must work together to strengthen agriculture, ensure equitable food access, and fight hunger in a sustainable way.

Technological progress offers new opportunities—but also new risks. The rapid rise of artificial intelligence, cyberattacks, and disinformation endanger democratic stability. The ITU notes that 2.7 billion people lacked internet access in 2023. Haiti, among the least connected countries, must receive support to bridge this digital divide and participate fully in the 21st-century global economy.

Haiti also reaffirms its commitment to protecting our shared natural heritage—the oceans. I am proud to announce that Haiti will sign the *Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction* (BBNJ), adopted on 19 June 2023. This agreement is vital to safeguarding marine biodiversity, ensuring the sustainable use of ocean resources, and bolstering the resilience of island states like ours against climate threats.

These global challenges demand renewed multilateralism, solidarity, and collective action. Haiti is ready to collaborate with the international community to overcome these crises and build a future rooted in peace, justice, and human dignity. But we cannot do it alone. It is together that we must act to ensure no one is left behind.

### 5. The President’s Journey and Experience

Mr President,  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

I speak to you today with the experience of many years devoted to serving my country. My political journey, deeply rooted in Haiti’s history, has brought me through many trials, always guided by the same objective: the advancement of my country, the restoration of pride and dignity, and the well-being of the Haitian people.

Having presided over the Haitian Senate from 1995 to 2000, and having witnessed critical moments in our nation’s political life, I have seen firsthand the challenges we face. My political commitment dates back to a time when the struggles for stability and democracy were ever-present.

Today, as President of the Presidential Transitional Council (PTC), I once again find myself at a turning point in Haiti’s history. My path has taught me that resilience and collective will are the only ways to guarantee a stable and prosperous future. It is with this vision, dedication, and the strength drawn from this rich political experience that I have committed myself to leading the Transition—resolutely guiding Haiti towards peace, security, and participatory democracy, through the holding of a National Conference and the renewal of our political leadership via free, credible, and transparent elections.

### 6. National Unity and Haitian Responsibility

Despite the unprecedented challenges—devastating violence, persistent political instability, near-universal precarity, and degrading poverty—the Haitian people refuse to give in to despair. In the midst of this storm, they have made a courageous decision: to come together, to unite in spite of deep divisions, in order to recover and move forward with confidence towards resolving the multidimensional crisis that has afflicted them for far too long.

The creation of the Presidential Transitional Council embodies this decision. It is a tangible expression of our will to reconcile with ourselves. This Council, bringing together civil society organisations and all political currents in the country, is the product of prolonged negotiations. It reflects the pluralism of Haitian society. Its roadmap is clear: restore public security, organise free and transparent elections by the end of 2025, and re-establish confidence in State institutions.

To achieve this, we—those holding the highest responsibilities of the State—know we will need the support of the international community. But first and foremost, we must rely on ourselves, on our resilience, and our ability to overcome internal differences and divisions.

---

### 7. Shared Responsibility of the International Community

It is important to emphasise that resolving Haiti’s problems rests primarily on the shoulders of the Haitian people. It is our duty, as a sovereign nation, to take our destiny in hand, to overcome our divisions, and to build together a future of peace and prosperity.

However, this responsibility is not ours alone. The international community, the United Nations, and foreign powers that have played decisive roles in Haiti’s history also bear an essential share in this process of restoring peace, economic recovery, institutional development, and the establishment of the rule of law.

In this sense, Haiti’s failure to recover is not the failure of one nation alone—it is a collective failure, a global inability to fully uphold the principles of solidarity, justice, and international cooperation. It is together, with shared responsibility and renewed commitment, that we can transform this crisis into opportunity and chart a sustainable path toward peace.

### 8. National Security Crisis and Crimes Against Humanity

Today, Haiti is facing a security crisis of unprecedented gravity. The rise of armed gangs, widespread violence, and political instability have placed the nation in a state of extreme vulnerability. Citizens live in fear, unable to move freely across the national territory, to go to work, or to send their children to school safely—especially in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area.

This situation affects every aspect of Haitian society. It weakens institutions, paralyses the economy, and undermines the hope of a better future.

The country's future is under threat. Shockingly, 50% of gang members in the capital region are children and adolescents—both boys and girls—often used as cannon fodder in confrontations with law enforcement. These minors are subjected to severe abuse, including sexual violence. Such acts must be recognised as crimes against humanity.

Restoring national security is an absolute priority for the Haitian authorities. We are fully committed to ending this spiral of violence and re-establishing order so that every citizen may enjoy their fundamental right to safety. Peace and stability are the indispensable foundations for Haiti’s recovery, the rebuilding of public trust, and the country’s socio-economic development.

In this light, the Security Council’s decision to authorise the deployment of the Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) through Resolution 2699 was a direct response to the Haitian people’s call. Although not a classic UN peacekeeping force, this mission embodies the international community’s commitment to supporting Haiti in its fight against insecurity.

On behalf of the Haitian people, I express profound gratitude to the contributing countries—particularly Kenya, which has agreed to lead the mission—and to all nations that have offered support. The national security forces, with the mission’s assistance, have already achieved tangible results, helping the population gradually regain a sense of normalcy. Much work remains.

Haiti has hosted several UN missions over the past three decades, including MINUSTAH. While some contributed to temporary stability, they also left a heavy legacy. Allegations of serious human rights violations—including sexual abuse—have shaken the Haitian people’s trust. The lack of accountability and reparations for victims has fostered a sense of impunity, undermining reconstruction efforts.

Yet it is never too late to act rightly and to learn from the past. By rethinking the approach, we have the opportunity to restore the reputation of international missions in Haiti and build a better future. It is in this spirit that we wish to initiate a discussion on transforming the Security Support Mission (MSS) into a UN-mandated Peacekeeping Operation (PKO). This transformation would secure more stable funding, expand the mission’s capacity, and strengthen Member States' commitment to security in Haiti. I am convinced that such a change—ensuring past errors are not repeated—will guarantee the mission’s full success in Haiti.

### 9. Historical Reparations and Justice

Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

I stand before this Assembly today as the voice of the Republic of Haiti—a nation whose history is inextricably linked to the ideals of freedom and justice that we all cherish here. Yet Haiti, the first Black independent nation in the world, has also been the victim of a historical injustice that not only delayed its development but continues to burden its people to this day.

In 1825, barely twenty-one years after securing its independence through a heroic struggle, Haiti was forced to pay an enormous indemnity to France—its former coloniser—in exchange for diplomatic recognition. This ransom, extorted under threat of force, siphoned the resources of a young nation and condemned it to a vicious cycle of impoverishment from which it still struggles to emerge. It was a penalty imposed for daring to cast off the chains of slavery and affirm the dignity of the Haitian people. It was a profoundly unjust punishment that stifled Haiti’s economic and social potential for generations.

In today’s context—where urgent efforts are underway to restore security and respond to Haiti’s vast humanitarian needs—I believe it is also crucial to draw the Assembly’s attention to the lingering scars of colonialism and the indemnities paid to certain powers that have severely constrained Haiti’s development. It is worth recalling that Haiti remains the only nation in history to have paid for its own independence—won not through treaties, but in the fire and blood of revolution. As we approach the bicentenary of this unprecedented historical event, is it not time to consider restitution?

In this regard, Haiti welcomes the proposals put forward by several governments and United Nations agencies advocating for concrete action to recognise, repair, and redress historical wrongs. Haiti has full confidence in the United Nations—whose foundations rest on equality among peoples and the maintenance of peace among nations—to play its part, particularly by helping establish appropriate mechanisms for dialogue between formerly colonised countries and former colonial powers.

At this 79th Session of the General Assembly, Haiti is not merely making a claim for reparations, but rather raising a matter of principle—of moral justice. My initiative is committed, structured, and well documented. The National Committee on Restitution and Reparations, in collaboration with the CARICOM Reparations Commission, has already undertaken comprehensive work on this matter. We call for recognition of a moral and historical debt, and the implementation of just and appropriate reparations that would help our people cast off the invisible chains of an unjust past.

### 10. Conclusion

Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

History teaches us that nations do not rise through isolation, but through the union of forces and a shared commitment to building a common future. Haiti—this land that gave the world an unyielding symbol of liberty, and which supported many other nations in their struggle against the brutal grip of colonialism—is not seeking charity. It seeks justice. It seeks respect for its dignity, and the right to a dignified and prosperous existence.

The challenges we face today are vast, but they are not insurmountable. They call for a shared vision, a deep sense of our common humanity, and the determination to turn crises into opportunities for renewal.

Every nation—whether large or small, wealthy or vulnerable—holds a part of our collective future in its hands. It is in this interdependence that the true strength of multilateralism resides. May this General Debate be the moment where we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to peace, to human dignity, and to sustainable development—for what we do today will echo through the centuries to come.

History will judge how we responded to the defining challenges of our time. Together, in a spirit of solidarity and cooperation, we can—and we must—build a future where no people and no nation is left behind.

**Long live Haiti!**  
**Long live international cooperation!**  
**Tomorrow, a different country! Tomorrow, a different world!**

**I thank you for your attention.**
