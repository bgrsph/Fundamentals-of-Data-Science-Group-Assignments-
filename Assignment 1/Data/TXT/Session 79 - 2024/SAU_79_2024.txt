Your Majesties, Excellencies, Highnesses,  
Mr. President of the United Nations General Assembly,  
Mr. Secretary-General of the United Nations,  
Distinguished delegates,  

**Peace be upon you all.**

At the outset, we would like to extend our congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Philemon Yang on his election as President of the 79th session of the General Assembly, and express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis for his efforts during his presidency of the previous session.

We also extend our sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. António Guterres, for his tireless efforts in upholding the principles and objectives of the United Nations Charter.

**Mr. President,**

Since its participation in the founding of this organisation, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has spared no effort in translating the UN Charter into tangible reality, through its firm commitment to respecting international law, preserving international peace and security, and supporting multilateral cooperation across all domains.

In this regard, the Kingdom actively participated in shaping the **Pact for the Future** adopted by world leaders this week. We consider both the Pact and the **Summit of the Future** to be important opportunities to reaffirm our shared principles, enhance cooperation in addressing global challenges, achieve peace and security, and support sustainable development for future generations.

The Kingdom is also committed to activating the role of international financial institutions to ensure continued economic recovery and risk reduction.

**Mr. President,**

Our world today is facing numerous crises exacerbated by the tendency to manage rather than resolve them. This stems from a lack of effective international efforts and the **selective application of international law and international humanitarian law**, resulting in widening conflict zones and erosion of international legitimacy.

This reality obliges us to reaffirm the principles and foundations enshrined in the UN Charter, and to engage seriously and jointly in long-term peaceful solutions that protect civilians, end wars, and ensure regional and international security and prosperity.

Amidst existing tensions, Saudi Arabia adopts a **non-alignment policy**, seeking to **promote dialogue, mutual understanding, and rapprochement between nations** to bolster global peace and stability.

In this context, the Kingdom **reiterates its categorical rejection and condemnation of all heinous Israeli crimes committed against the Palestinian people**. The recent atrocities against defenceless civilians in **Gaza** are but one chapter in the long history of suffering endured by the Palestinian people.

Israeli practices since last year alone have led to the deaths of **tens of thousands of civilians**, mostly women and children, through systematic bombardment, killing, destruction, and starvation amid a growing humanitarian catastrophe.

Driven by our unequivocal rejection of this tragic reality, and the urgent need to end it, the Kingdom **hosted the Extraordinary Joint Arab and Islamic Summit** in **Riyadh on 11 November 2023**, with the participation of heads of state and governments from the **Arab League** and **Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)**.

The Summit's resolutions reflected the will of the Arab and Islamic peoples and **called for an immediate end to the bloodshed**, unrestricted humanitarian access, and the fulfilment of the **legitimate rights of the Palestinian people**, including the establishment of an **independent state**.

---

The Kingdom chaired the **ministerial committee mandated by the Summit** to conduct visits to various countries and **urge the international community to shoulder its responsibility**, halt Israeli aggression, and protect civilians.

In this context, the Kingdom **welcomes the General Assembly resolution of 10 May 2024**, recognising that the **State of Palestine is qualified for full UN membership**. We also welcome the recent **recognitions of the State of Palestine** by Norway, Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and Armenia, and call upon other countries to follow suit.

In line with our **shared responsibility** to turn recognition into reality, the Kingdom, together with its partners in the **Joint Arab-Islamic Ministerial Committee**, **Norway**, and the **European Union**, announced the launch of an **International Coalition to implement the Two-State Solution**.

---

The Kingdom has provided over **$5 billion in aid to the Palestinian people**. Since the beginning of the current crisis in **Gaza**, through the **King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center**, it has delivered nearly **$185 million** in relief and humanitarian aid.

Agreements have also been signed with several **UN and international humanitarian organisations** for the implementation of projects worth over **$106 million**. The Kingdom continues to support **UNRWA**, enabling it to provide relief services, food, medicine, and other humanitarian needs to Palestinian refugees—**totaling over $1 billion in support** to date.

The Kingdom also welcomes the **advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice** on Israeli policies and practices in the occupied Palestinian territories, confirming the **illegality of Israel’s presence** in these territories since 1967.

We stress the need for **credible and practical steps** toward a just and comprehensive resolution of the Palestinian issue, based on **international legitimacy** and the **Arab Peace Initiative**, guaranteeing the Palestinian people's right to establish their **independent state** along the **1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital**.

---

The absence of accountability and punishment for Israeli violations of international and humanitarian law **emboldens further escalation**, as we now witness in **Lebanon**, where attacks and violations are mounting. This escalation **will not bring security to any party**, and only threatens to expand violence and conflict, jeopardising the region's security and stability.

The Kingdom emphasises the need to **preserve Lebanon’s stability and sovereignty**, in accordance with international law and relevant Security Council resolutions. We join **international efforts aimed at a sustainable ceasefire** and **urge all parties to exercise utmost restraint** to spare the region the horrors of war.

---

**Mr. President,**

The Kingdom has taken concrete steps toward **de-escalation and regional development**. An agreement was reached with the **Islamic Republic of Iran** to resume diplomatic relations based on mutual respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs, aligned with the **UN Charter** and the **OIC Charter**, contributing to regional security, stability, and prosperity.

We look forward to Iran’s cooperation with the international community on its **nuclear and ballistic missile programmes**.

The Kingdom has also resumed diplomatic relations with the **Syrian Arab Republic**, to strengthen cooperation on shared issues, based on our belief that resolving the Syrian crisis contributes to regional development and stability. We reaffirm the importance of maintaining Syria’s **unity, security, stability, and territorial integrity**, for the benefit of its people.

---

Saudi Arabia remains committed to **restoring peace in Yemen**, supporting all efforts to resolve the crisis, alleviate humanitarian suffering, and reach political solutions that bring peace and stability to Yemen and the region. We reaffirm our **initiative to end the war and achieve a comprehensive political solution**.

In light of tensions in the **Red Sea region** affecting maritime security and global trade, the Kingdom **reiterates its call for de-escalation**, and for **joint efforts to safeguard the Red Sea’s security**, which is of **global interest**.

On **Sudan**, the Kingdom affirms its **steadfast position** on preserving Sudan’s security, unity, and stability, and preventing state collapse. We hosted **Sudanese peace talks in Jeddah**, advocating for de-escalation, a ceasefire, and humanitarian access. Work is ongoing to resume **Jeddah 3 talks**.

---

The Kingdom is also committed to **Afghanistan’s security, stability, and unity**, and affirms that **Afghanistan cannot live in isolation** from its regional and international surroundings, especially given the threat posed by the continued presence of terrorist groups.

We stress the need to **prevent the deterioration of humanitarian, security, and economic conditions**, which provides fertile ground for extremist groups and militias. We believe that **economic and development stability requires a politically and socially stable environment**.

---

On the **Russia-Ukraine crisis**, the Kingdom **reiterates its call for an end to the conflict**, and for the reduction of its global repercussions. His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and Prime Minister has made **commendable efforts** to secure the release of **prisoners of war** of various nationalities.

Saudi Arabia also hosted a **meeting of National Security Advisers** in 2023 with over **40 countries and international organisations**, underscoring the need for **all efforts** toward resolving the crisis peacefully, respecting international law, and safeguarding the interests of all parties. The Kingdom **remains ready to continue mediating between the two sides**.

---

**Mr. President,**

Guided by **Vision 2030**, the Kingdom seeks to meet the aspirations of future generations, empower women and youth, foster creativity and innovation, and promote tolerance and global engagement. Our developmental approach aims for a **comprehensive and sustainable renaissance**, focused on human dignity, rights, and wellbeing.

In the energy sector, the Kingdom balances **energy security**, **affordability**, and **climate action**. It works to ensure **global oil market stability and sustainability**, reliable supply, and access to energy—supporting a prosperous global economy beneficial to producers and consumers alike.

We adopt a **comprehensive, pragmatic, and equitable approach to the energy transition**, aiming to achieve the goals of the **UNFCCC** and the **Paris Agreement**, using all technologies to address **greenhouse gas emissions**, including oil and gas, which will remain central to the **global energy mix** for decades.

---

The Kingdom possesses advanced technology that makes it one of the **lowest emitters of carbon and methane** in oil and gas operations, and continues to develop **low-emission energy products**.

We are building a **carbon capture, transport, and storage hub** in Jubail Industrial City with a capacity of **9 million tonnes annually by 2027**, and an ultimate capacity of **44 million tonnes annually by 2035**.

---

We support the **Sustainable Development Goals** and **international cooperation** to tackle climate change. At the **Saudi-African Summit in Riyadh**, we announced a **$50 billion fund** to support these efforts and launched major initiatives based on the **circular carbon economy**, such as the **Saudi Green Initiative** and the **Middle East Green Initiative**.

We are also investing in **renewables**, **clean hydrogen production**, and other initiatives to **reduce carbon intensity**, protect biodiversity, and preserve water and marine resources.

The Kingdom hosted the **World Environment Day 2024**, and will host the **16th Conference of the Parties (COP16) to the UNCCD** later this year, reaffirming our commitment to environmental protection and combating drought and desertification.

We will also host the **11th World Water Forum in 2027**, following the Crown Prince’s announcement last year to establish a **Global Water Organisation** to coordinate and integrate efforts to address water challenges globally.

---

**Mr. President,**

The Kingdom is dedicated to achieving a **nuclear weapons-free world** and a **stable Middle East**, and stresses the need for all countries to uphold the **non-proliferation regime**, while maintaining the **right to peaceful nuclear energy**.

We support **international efforts to combat terrorism**, and stress the importance of **cooperation, information-sharing**, and **cutting off terrorist financing**. We must also counter extremist propaganda campaigns.

---

The Kingdom has earned the trust of the international community and was selected to host **Expo 2030** under the theme *“The Era of Change: Together for a Foresighted Tomorrow”*, with a focus on sustainable development, innovation, and global solutions.

We thank the countries that supported our bid to host this global event, which will showcase our commitment to development, inclusion, and sustainability, particularly for the benefit of developing nations.

---

**In conclusion,**  
We hope that our efforts will help convey our values and principles to the world in a spirit of **respect and partnership**, as we work together to build a better future for all humanity.

**Peace be upon you all.**
