**• Mr António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations**  
**• Mr Philémon Yunji Yang, President of the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly**  
**• Distinguished Heads of State and Government**  
**• Ladies and Gentlemen, Delegates**  

I stand before you today, on behalf of His Excellency General of the Army Corps Mamadi Doumbouya, President of the Republic of Guinea, with the honour and responsibility of representing a nation engaged in a historic refoundation. We are here to affirm our determination to redefine our future—a future built on peace, justice, and dignity for all.  

Three dates, three events, three moments that embody the spirit of resilience and freedom of our people.  

- On 28 September 1958, the people of Guinea voted overwhelmingly “No” in the referendum proposed by General de Gaulle, thereby choosing immediate independence.  
- On 28 September 2009, that same people demanded, at great cost, their full enjoyment of freedom, democracy, and dignity.  
- Today, 28 September 2024, on this symbolic day, we stand before this Assembly to renew our commitment, freely, to these movements and to forge a future founded on peace, justice, and dignity for all.  

At this time of global turmoil, marked by conflicts, growing inequalities, and a climate crisis that threatens our very existence, it is imperative that we act boldly and unite in vision. It is with this conviction that I address this august Assembly.  

First, I would like to salute the United Nations—this unique space for dialogue and cooperation, where all nations, large and small, meet on an equal footing to build a better world.  

Our faith in this institution is deep, for it reflects our shared values of peace, sustainable development, and respect for human rights.  

We know the challenges we face today are immense. But we also know that the spirit of solidarity and cooperation that has guided this organisation since its creation is more necessary than ever.  

**Mr President,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,**  

Today, the Republic of Guinea is engaged in an ambitious process of profound state refoundation. Under the leadership of the National Committee of the Rally for Development (CNRD) and the President of the Republic, His Excellency General of the Army Corps Mamadi Doumbouya, we have chosen to turn the page on instability and write a new history—one of a resilient nation reinventing itself to offer its people a dignified, free, and prosperous life.  

This transition is guided by principles of transparency, accountability, and justice. It is led with courage and determination, mobilising all forces of the nation. We are committed to building a strong rule-of-law state, guaranteeing fundamental freedoms, and promoting social justice for all citizens.  

Guinea aspires to become a model of resilience and renewal in Africa, proving that even in the face of adversity, positive transformation is possible.  

The clearest example of our commitment to justice and the fight against impunity is the historic trial of the events of 28 September 2009. For the first time in our nation's history, those responsible for these atrocities were brought to justice before a national court—marking a decisive turning point in our fight against impunity.  

This trial, now a global reference, is an example for Africa. It embodies our determination to build a state governed by the rule of law, where human rights are protected and no crime goes unpunished, regardless of the perpetrator’s rank or influence.  

It reflects our will to rebuild our society on solid foundations of justice, truth, and reconciliation, while inspiring other nations to follow the same path of responsibility and transparency.  

In this spirit of national renewal, His Excellency President Mamadi Doumbouya has laid out a clear and ambitious vision to guide Guinea toward a prosperous future, structured around three fundamental pillars: social, economic, and political.  

- **Socially**, we put human dignity and inclusion at the heart of our actions, prioritising equal access to education, healthcare, and social protection for every Guinean.  
- **Economically**, we aim to build a resilient and inclusive economy, based on the valorisation of our natural resources, the diversification of our industrial base, and the development of modern infrastructure.  
- **Politically**, we tirelessly work to build a state governed by the rule of law, where justice, transparency, and citizen participation form the foundations of governance.  

Together, these three pillars converge to build a strong, resilient Guinea capable of meeting the legitimate aspirations of its people.  

Aligned with this national renewal, we ground our actions in five essential values that redefine governance in our country:  

1. **Institutional Rectification** – building robust and legitimate institutions that guarantee stability and transparency.  
2. **State Refoundation** – strengthening public integrity and restoring state authority in response to our people’s deep aspirations.  
3. **Unity** – bringing together all components of the nation, strengthening social cohesion around a shared future.  
4. **Recovery** – establishing transparent and responsible governance, bringing the state closer to its citizens.  
5. **Guinea’s Repositioning on the International Stage** – deepening our engagement with global partners and ensuring dynamic cooperation with international institutions.  

These values guide every step we take on the path to national transformation in a spirit of justice, solidarity, and dignity.  

At the heart of this national transformation is an emblematic project that embodies our vision for the future: the **Simandou Megaproject** and its ambitious “**Simandou 2040**” programme.  

More than just a mining project, Simandou 2040 is a model for Guinea’s comprehensive transformation. It aims to build a genuine social and environmental programme around the project—one in which people and nature coexist in harmony.  

By allocating 20% of the revenue to human capital development, we affirm our intention to ensure the economic benefits of Simandou directly reach our people.  

This project also exemplifies unprecedented international cooperation, where the interests of global powers—China and the United States, typically rivals—coexist in Guinea in a climate of constructive collaboration.  

Simandou proves that Guinea can not only harness its natural resources but manage them transparently and sustainably for the benefit of all.  

Unlike countries that have fallen victim to the so-called “resource curse,” we reject that path. Simandou is designed as an opportunity for inclusive development, where every citizen and community can benefit from our natural wealth—without it becoming a source of instability.  

We have learned from the past and are committed to making Simandou a lever for prosperity, stability, and sustainable growth—combining resource exploitation with environmental protection and the social wellbeing of our people.  

**Ladies and Gentlemen,**  

In this refoundation process, we draw inspiration from our nation’s rich and diverse history, one rooted in ancestral values of justice, solidarity, and respect for human dignity.  

From the **Kouroukanfouga Charter**, proclaimed in 1236—already forbidding slavery and promoting equality and freedom for all—to the theocratic organisation of **Fouta**, recognised as a land of asylum and protection for the oppressed, Guinea has long been a bastion of humanist values and fair governance.  

These traditions, visible in the communal structures of **Lower Guinea** and **Forest Guinea**, where collective resource management and peaceful conflict resolution were central, remind us that our national identity is rooted in a quest for justice, peace, and solidarity.  

As we shape our nation's future, we reaffirm these values in the **new Constitution** of the Republic of Guinea. This foundational text, currently in development, reflects the spirit of our culture and the traditions of tolerance and inclusion from our past.  

We aim to build a modern state that incorporates these timeless principles—a state where every citizen, regardless of origin, culture, or faith, finds their place in a harmonious and united society.  

This refoundation is more than institutional change—it is a return to our roots, a reconnection with the true foundations of our history, and a commitment to uphold these values in our pursuit of peace.  

**Ladies and Gentlemen,**  

This path of renewal cannot be walked alone. We call for sincere and strengthened international support—based on mutual respect, attentive partnership, and shared goals.  

Guinea does not seek compassion, but proposes partnership—an active and dynamic alliance to build a world where peace, justice, and dignity are universal rights.  

This is also a unique opportunity for Guinea to redefine its role on the international stage—as a committed and responsible actor contributing to regional stability and global peace.  

We are ready to work with our partners to meet shared challenges and make Guinea a model of resilience and integrity.  

**Mr President,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,**  

Peace and security are not merely aspirations—they are imperatives for our planet’s future.  

Guinea is firmly committed to playing its part in promoting peace, regionally and globally. We have actively contributed to peacekeeping under United Nations auspices and will continue to do so, convinced that peace is the foundation for development and justice.  

However, peace can only be achieved through enhanced cooperation and significant reform of multilateral institutions.  

We must also rethink our approach to resolving persistent conflicts in the Sahel region.  

It is time to go beyond purely military responses and adopt an integrated strategy combining economic development, institutional strengthening, and regional cooperation.  

To build lasting peace, we must first address the root causes of instability, encourage inclusive dialogue, and promote reconciliation among communities to rebuild trust and social cohesion.  

The fight against terrorism and armed conflict can only succeed with a holistic approach that places social justice, equitable development, and regional solidarity at the core of our efforts.  

It is therefore time for the United Nations Security Council to genuinely reflect the diversity and aspirations of today's world—including those of Africa.  

We strongly support the **Ezulwini Consensus** and call for more equitable and democratic representation within decision-making bodies.  

The Security Council must reflect the world as it is today—with all its diversity and ambitions. Africa, with its 54 member states—more than a quarter of the UN—can no longer be relegated to a secondary role in matters of global peace and security.  

We call for Africa to obtain permanent seats on the Security Council, with all associated rights, including the veto.  

Africa has demonstrated its ability to actively contribute to peace at regional and international levels. It is time for the voice of its billion-plus people to be heard fairly and justly in the highest global decision-making bodies.  

For truly inclusive and sustainable peace, Africa must have a legitimate place at the heart of the UN Security Council.  

**Mr President,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,**  

Faced with the multiple crises shaking our world, it is clear that our responses must be collective and humanitarian.  

Everywhere, people are suffering from the ravages of war—families torn apart, communities displaced, lives lost, vital infrastructure destroyed.  

Whether in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, the Middle East, between Israel and Palestine, in Africa, or elsewhere, the suffering of people knows no borders or nationalities.  

To these human tragedies we must add the devastating impacts of climate change, which worsen conflicts and increase the vulnerability of the poorest.  

We cannot ignore the urgency of environmental protection.  

The **Fouta Djallon massif**, the "water tower" of West Africa, is essential for the ecological stability of our region—affecting 15 states.  

By reaffirming our commitment to have it listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, we send a strong message in favour of ecosystem preservation while preventing potential conflicts over water resource management.  

Protecting our region’s ecological balance is also protecting peace for future generations.  

We call on the international community to strengthen commitments to the **Sustainable Development Goals**, particularly for the Least Developed Countries.  

It is urgent to ensure fair climate financing and adopt energy transition policies that leave no one behind.  

The future of our nations depends on investing in our **youth**, the greatest asset of our countries.  

By offering young people opportunities and means to reach their full potential, we can effectively combat the problems driving them toward irregular migration.  

Migration is not a solution—it is draining our countries of their most valuable human resources.  

We must create environments where youth see their future at home, in a prosperous and stable Africa.  

In addition, technological and digital advances must benefit all—not just a privileged few.  

Technology will only be truly beneficial if it serves all humanity, equitably.  

We therefore advocate for **universal access to technological innovation**, ensuring **ethics remain central** to its use.  

Information and communication technologies must help **bridge inequalities**, not widen them.  

**The Republic of Guinea calls for a new global solidarity**—one that transcends borders and differences, placing humanity at the centre of all concerns.  

In the face of global challenges, we share a duty to promote peace, protect human dignity, and seek just solutions together.  

We must act now to ensure peace is not just an aspiration, but a tangible reality for every child, woman, and man on this planet.  

**Mr President,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,**  

The Republic of Guinea stands today at a decisive crossroads in its history, determined to chart a new course—a path of deep and inclusive refoundation.  

This refoundation is not only a national aspiration—it is a call to collective action. It is a challenge to the entire international community to build a world where peace and justice are not mere words, but lived realities for every human being.  

We know the road to this ideal is strewn with obstacles, but we firmly believe that the greatest victories are forged in adversity.  

We reject indifference. We reject division. Our choice is clear: we choose action, solidarity, and the courage to build a better future—together.  

Today, we call on nations to unite around a common vision: a world that places the human being at the centre of all its priorities.  

Together, we can overcome the greatest challenges, extinguish the flames of conflict, and embrace a lasting peace based on justice, dignity, and inclusion.  

As a sovereign nation determined to forge its own destiny, Guinea stands proudly on the international stage with a clear and independent vision.  

Exactly one year ago, from this same United Nations podium, the Head of State, His Excellency General Mamadi Doumbouya, declared powerfully:  

> “We are neither pro- nor anti-American, nor pro- nor anti-Chinese, nor pro- nor anti-French, nor pro- nor anti-Russian, nor pro- nor anti-Turkish. We are simply pro-African.”  

This declaration remains our position today: a Guinea firmly rooted in African interests, yet open to fair and respectful cooperation with all nations of the world.  

We choose to uphold our values and priorities without submitting to external influences dictated by others.  

Guinea, strong in its history and values, is ready to walk alongside all those who believe in a shared future of prosperity and mutual respect.  

Our commitment is total. Our determination unshakeable. We will leave no one behind.  

Such is the wish of His Excellency General Mamadi Doumbouya, President of the Republic, and of the people of Guinea:  

**May our actions today shape a future of peace and hope for all.**  

**Long live peace! Together, for a better world!**  
**Thank you.**
