**Excellency, Mr President of the General Assembly,**  
**Majesties, Highnesses, Excellencies, Heads of Delegation, Ladies and Gentlemen,**

**Assalam Alaikum!**

I have the honour of conveying to you the warm greetings of His Excellency Mr Azali Assoumani, President of the Union of the Comoros, along with his wishes for full success in the conduct of these proceedings of global importance.

First, allow me to express, on behalf of the Comorian delegation, our sincere thanks to the American authorities for the warm welcome extended to us in New York for our participation in this seventy-ninth session of the UN General Assembly.

I would also like to extend my warm congratulations to His Excellency Mr Philémon Yang for his brilliant election as President of this 79th session. As Africans, we are honoured by his appointment.

I equally pay a deserved tribute to His Excellency Mr Dennis Francis for his wise leadership and commitment to peace and development during his presidency of the seventy-eighth session, which he conducted flawlessly.

Finally, on behalf of my country, I extend our deepest gratitude to His Excellency Mr António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his service in promoting peace and development.

**Mr President,**

This 79th session opens once again at a particularly delicate moment for the international community.  
Since 22 February 2022, the war in Ukraine has continued to ravage two major European nations, endangering the balance of the world.

On behalf of the Union of the Comoros, I implore the Russian and Ukrainian leaders to choose dialogue and negotiation. I appeal to them—for the sake of their peoples, for the legacy they will leave in history, but also because a ceasefire, followed by peace, is indispensable for economic, social, and food security globally, and especially for Africa, which suffers deeply from this conflict.

On the situation in Palestine: in light of the daily realities on the ground, there is no doubt that this is not a matter of self-defence. This war, marked by a disproportion of force and targeting mainly innocents, is nothing short of **a genocide perpetrated by Israeli forces in Gaza**. It must be condemned, and it must end urgently.

The suffering of the Palestinian people has already led to the deaths of over **forty thousand people**, including innocent women and children; over **one hundred thousand injured**; the **forcible displacement of thousands** in inhumane conditions; and the **systematic destruction of hospitals and social housing**.

The Union of the Comoros, while reaffirming its full solidarity and unwavering support for the brotherly people of Palestine, makes an urgent appeal to the international community to act for an immediate cessation of hostilities and the swift resumption of humanitarian aid.

We also call for a just and lasting solution based on international law and relevant United Nations resolutions.  
We especially urge the international community to act swiftly to achieve a **two-state solution**, with a **sovereign Palestinian state** with **East Jerusalem as its capital**, living side by side in full security with Israel.  
We welcome the admission of the State of Palestine as a full Member of the United Nations and its participation in UN proceedings from this session onwards.

Let me also remind you—because it is often forgotten—that the situation in the **West Bank** is equally grave. As Cardinal Pizzaballa, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, rightly stated, it is “a concrete and visible example of how hatred, resentment, and contempt have led to increasingly extreme forms of violence that are becoming harder to contain.”

The situation in **Sudan** also commands our full attention. We urge both parties to exercise restraint, to spare civilians from the horrors of a war that has dragged on too long between brothers.

On the **Western Sahara**, the Union of the Comoros believes that the **autonomy plan proposed by the Kingdom of Morocco** in 2007 represents the most credible path to a durable resolution of an outdated conflict, whose continuation runs counter to the interests of the local populations and regional development.  
My country therefore urges all stakeholders to support this plan and calls on the international community to lend its support.

I would also like to stress that **law and openness to dialogue** must guide the handling of political issues—especially regarding respect for **territorial integrity**.

On the **Comorian island of Mayotte**, I reaffirm that the unity of the Comoros is a reality rooted in ethno-geographic, linguistic, religious, and economic facts, despite the country's insular nature.  
This unity is also backed by our strong commitment to international law and the relevant UN resolutions, which recognise **Comorian sovereignty over Mayotte**.

Hence, I take this opportunity, at this United Nations platform—the ultimate symbol of multilateralism—to reaffirm the Government of the Comoros’ consistent position: we are committed to the rule of law and open to dialogue in this dispute with France, so as to reach a fair and lasting solution that preserves the shared interests of our two friendly nations.

**Mr President,**

The Union of the Comoros reaffirms its support for the **Declaration adopted at the Summit of the Future** held on 22 September during this Assembly.  
We advocate for genuine international cooperation to establish guidelines that will lead to **legal frameworks governing the fair development and use of artificial intelligence** in ways that boost growth, productivity, and knowledge worldwide.

This Declaration also offers promising prospects in addressing the specific challenges of **Small Island Developing States (SIDS)**. In this regard, the **SIDS4 Conference** held last May in Antigua and Barbuda marked an important step in raising global awareness.

Because we call for strict compliance with the **Paris Agreement** and expect substantial financial and technical support, we look forward to the upcoming **Development Financing Conference**, to be held in **Spain in 2025**.

That conference will offer Southern countries an opportunity to advocate for reforms to multilateral development banks and institutions—and to secure for our countries a forward-looking framework of sustainable, accessible, and predictable financial resources.

To ensure the success of that event, I urge the most concerned countries to meet without delay and work together to formulate joint proposals.

**Mr President,**

**Peace and political stability are the two essential pillars of development.**  
Following the presidential elections of 14 January 2024, which returned His Excellency Mr Azali Assoumani to office, he has continued the noble mission of accelerating the emergence of the Comoros by 2030.

The President’s commitment is being realised through flagship projects under the **Emerging Comoros Plan (Plan Comores Emergent)**, presented at the **Comoros Development Partners Conference**, held in Paris in December 2019.

The plan also includes strategic initiatives, notably the development of the **Blue Economy**—a promising sector and a key driver of the country’s economic and social transformation.

Recognising the unique circumstances of island states and the vital role of the blue economy, the Comoros—under its presidency of the African Union—organised a **Ministerial Conference on the Blue Economy and Climate Action** in **Moroni, June 2023**, supported by various partners.  
Themed *“Island States on the Front Lines,”* the conference brought together all island and coastal African states.

The **Moroni Declaration**, adopted at the close of the conference, outlines the roadmap to ensure that the international community fully acknowledges the **vulnerability and uniqueness** of such states.

The upcoming **Ocean Conference** will offer a platform to present the Moroni Declaration, whose commitments align with global sustainable development goals.

**Mr President,**

The Comorian Government gives special attention to **youth**. Several initiatives are under way to support youth entrepreneurship, increase employment opportunities across sectors, and enable young people to play a leading role in the socio-economic development of the country.

The passage of the **“One Youth – One Job” law** reflects this commitment.

The President’s dedication to the wellbeing of youth—and his trust in their ability to drive renewal—led him, only a few months ago, to appoint a **cabinet primarily composed of young professionals.**  
This bold step is a bet on the youth to shape the future and transformation of the country.

Beyond these key sectors, the President’s five-year agenda also prioritises **sports, culture, the arts, and heritage**, demonstrating his interest in the social pillars that shape and strengthen our national identity.

In sport, on behalf of the President and the Government of the Union of the Comoros, I pay heartfelt tribute to our **national football team, the Coelacanths**, for their increasingly impressive performance on the continental stage, to the great pride of the Comorian people.

**Mr President,**

The challenges facing the world today are many. They demand **collective action from us all**.

Each session of this Assembly is a moment of hope for peoples around the world—hope for change in the face of the anxieties and uncertainties that weigh upon them.

In the name of the noble values that unite us, let us work to transform those anxieties into calm, those fears into hope—and above all, into **realisation of our peoples’ aspirations**.

**I thank you for your kind attention.**
