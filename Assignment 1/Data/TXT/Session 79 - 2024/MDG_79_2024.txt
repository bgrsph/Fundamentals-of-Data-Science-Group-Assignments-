**Mr President, Excellencies, Heads of State and Government,  
Mr Secretary-General of the United Nations,  
Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,**

With a deep sense of honour and responsibility, I address you today, entrusted with the mandate of His Excellency Mr Andry RAJOELINA, President of the Republic of Madagascar, and on behalf of the Malagasy people.

I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr Philémon Yang on his election as President of this 79th session of the General Assembly. Your exemplary career and deep knowledge of international affairs are invaluable assets for guiding our work. Please be assured, Excellency, of Madagascar’s full support in carrying out your noble mission—especially as Madagascar is newly elected Vice-President of this General Assembly for the 2024–2025 term.

**Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen,**

The theme chosen for this session—*"No one left behind: acting together for peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations"*—resonates powerfully in these times of serious global uncertainty.

It strongly reminds us of the interconnectedness of global challenges and the urgent need for a collective, united, and determined response. Peace—ever a fragile foundation in a divided world—is today undermined by multiple crises with dangerous and deep geostrategic ramifications. Far from being a localised conflict, the war in Ukraine shakes the international order, exacerbates geopolitical tensions, worsens food and energy insecurity, and endangers global peace and security.

Terrorism and transnational crime continue to sow terror and despair, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable populations. The proliferation of weapons and drugs—especially in conflict zones—feeds a vicious cycle of violence and instability, hampering long-term development efforts and jeopardising the future of entire generations.

**The climate emergency** has become a tangible and devastating reality. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, the degradation of ecosystems, and the loss of biodiversity are all warning signs that demand immediate and decisive action.

Rising global inequalities are a fertile ground for social unrest, conflict, and instability. Far from being the “great leveller,” the COVID-19 pandemic has deepened existing fractures, exposing the weaknesses of many countries’ health and social protection systems and widening the gap between rich and developing nations.

**Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen,**

In the face of these threats, we must not give in to fear or fatalism. **Multilateralism**, as embodied by the United Nations, remains our best weapon and collective tool for building a safer and more peaceful world.

Yet, unfortunately, the current multilateral system—shaped in the post-war era—is struggling to respond effectively to the rapidly changing world. A **bold and ambitious reform** of the United Nations, particularly of the **Security Council**, is now more essential than ever. Africa, a continent experiencing rapid demographic and economic growth, cannot remain on the margins of global decision-making.

Effective implementation of the **Paris Agreement** and stronger commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions are **categorical imperatives** to safeguard our planet and ensure the well-being of future generations. On this point, President Andry RAJOELINA reaffirmed during his speech at **COP26 in Glasgow (September 2022)** the urgency of mobilising the **USD 100 billion** promised under the Paris Agreement to fund an energy transition in Africa.

Climate action cannot be dissociated from development. It is crucial to **support developing countries** in their transition to green and resilient economies by providing **adequate financial and technological resources**, and by recognising their **right to development**.

It is urgent to promote a **more inclusive and equitable model of global development**, one that **leaves no one behind**. Beyond words, the time has come for **concrete action**—especially for Africa—through massive investments in **education, healthcare, drinking water, social protection, infrastructure, innovation, and job creation**, especially for youth and women.

To ensure inclusive multilateralism, it is time to advocate for **fairer international trade**, **equitable access to knowledge and technology**, and **just financing and investment systems**. This is essential for **social justice** and **lasting peace** in the world.

**Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen,**

Madagascar, fully aware of these global challenges and the urgency of providing coordinated and lasting solutions, commits itself with determination alongside the United Nations and its Member States to building a **more just, united, and sustainable world**.

The concept of *“Fihavanana”*—the art of living together, deeply rooted in Malagasy culture—guides our action. It expresses our deep desire to live in harmony, with mutual respect and solidarity, ensuring that no one is left behind and that the most vulnerable are never forgotten. It is our path toward a fairer society.

Madagascar’s **General State Policy**, reflecting the vision of President Andry RAJOELINA, places **human capital** at the heart of development. Over the past five years, the country has made major investments in **education**, **health**, **family planning**, **security**, **innovative and inclusive social programmes**, **combating malnutrition**, and **infrastructure**—all aimed at breaking the cycle of poverty. We continue to invest heavily in these areas, which are the cornerstones of our human development agenda.

A country with a long-standing tradition of **peace and tolerance**, Madagascar has made **democracy, rule of law, and good governance** vital tools for preserving stability, strengthening peace and security, and advancing sustainable development. This is evidenced by the **2024 Global Peace Index**, which ranked Madagascar the **second most peaceful country in Sub-Saharan Africa**.

Though many challenges remain, the leadership of President RAJOELINA continues to rise to the expectations of our citizens, who granted him a new mandate in 2024 to implement **agricultural and industrial transformations**. These aim to generate **decent jobs and incomes for youth and rural populations**, create more **added value in the Malagasy economy**, and foster **peace and sustainable development**.

Today, Madagascar is the **third-largest rice producer in Africa**, but we aspire to become the **first**, through a new rural development policy. We aim to fully utilise all rice-growing basins in the country, adopt modern **agricultural inputs and irrigation technologies**, and boost **agricultural aggregation** to attract private investment in intensive rice and other crop production—such as potatoes and pulses.

To meet our development challenges, Madagascar is also intensifying efforts to **expand and improve its road network**, especially by constructing the **“Route du Soleil”**, which will connect all regions along the island’s eastern coast. This will boost public and private investment, streamline trade, enhance regional tourism, drive economic transformation, and promote national peace and security.

These infrastructure efforts are central to the Government’s **priority structural projects**. **Renewable energy** is also among our national priorities. We aim to realise our **industrialisation strategy** and improve rural living conditions by significantly reducing the government’s electricity subsidies, redirecting funds toward development. To this end, we are accelerating the rollout of the **solar park initiative across 47 districts**, as well as the construction of **multiple hydroelectric and solar power plants** in partnership with private investors and development partners—bringing an **additional 500 MW** of energy within the next 4–5 years.

Our goal is to **double both the agricultural and industrial share of GDP**, fostering a growth path that creates jobs and sustainable incomes—especially for youth and rural communities—thus transforming the economy and substantially reducing poverty, paving the way for a new era of development for Madagascar.

Although a **low emitter of greenhouse gases**, Madagascar is among the **most vulnerable countries** to climate change. We are already suffering the devastating consequences of **cyclones, droughts, coastal erosion, and biodiversity loss**, which threaten to erase the progress achieved through our agricultural and industrial transformation efforts.

As one of the few countries with a **negative carbon footprint**, thanks to our forests—some of the **green lungs of Africa**—Madagascar urges the **international community** to **intensify and accelerate climate adaptation financing**, particularly for **vulnerable island nations** like ours. Madagascar is committed to preserving this **natural heritage** for future generations.

**Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen,**

In conclusion, Madagascar calls more than ever for **stronger and fairer multilateralism**—a multilateralism grounded in **dialogue, cooperation, and solidarity**.

Madagascar will continue working tirelessly, alongside the United Nations and its Member States, to build a world of **peace, development, and dignity for all**.

**Thank you for your attention.**
