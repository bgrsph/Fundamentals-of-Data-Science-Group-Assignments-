When I first came to the United Nations General Assembly in 2019, I knew many people did not know, or had never heard of, El Salvador. And if they had, it was only by negative references—either as the most violent country in the world or as the country of the gangs. Others didn’t even know where it was.

But, thank God, that has changed—significantly and in a very short time.

Five years after that first speech, I stand before you today as the President of a country that now *does* have a voice in the world.

### PART I

In my previous addresses to this General Assembly, I spoke about our pursuit of *true* independence. For decades, we were shackled by the consequences of a foreign-fuelled civil war, and then by a false peace that left more dead than the war itself.

I also spoke of the importance of remembering that the **first duty of any government is to its own people**, and of the imperative to take our destiny into our own hands.

We were naive to think that other countries would save us, or that other nations would grant us freedom out of sheer kindness. We had to understand that truth, and then summon the courage to break our chains ourselves and reclaim our legitimate right to be free.

In the last five years, **El Salvador was reborn**. We gave the streets of our country back to our people. We established a thriving tourism industry, hosting international surf, sports, and entertainment events. We gave thousands of Salvadorans—who had fled from war and poverty—a country to return to.

We turned a nation that was once the **murder capital of the world** into the **safest place in the Western Hemisphere**.

This was the greatest challenge our nation has ever overcome. And though we still have a long road ahead and much to achieve, we are now within reach of **true independence** and on the path to full freedom.

El Salvador’s transformation is unparalleled, and our success is undeniable. Anyone is welcome to come and see it for themselves.

Salvadorans—regardless of whom they voted for in the past, of the town or city they were born in, of how much or how little they had, of whether they live within or beyond our borders—have united to support every decision that helps El Salvador become a country where people live peacefully and joyfully. A country where spiritual aspirations rise above the material—and touch everyone.

### PART II

Today, the world looks to El Salvador and asks: *How can a nation rise so quickly?* But perhaps that’s not the question we should be asking.

Perhaps the real question is: *How is the world falling so quickly?*

They say that El Salvador swims against the current—becoming safer while the world grows more dangerous; becoming more optimistic while much of the modern world grows increasingly pessimistic.

And they are right.

The world has become divided, depressed, anxious, hostile, and hopeless—and it has done so at an unprecedented pace.

Today, the **free world is no longer free**. This is not an exaggeration. Tragically, we see undeniable proof of this decline every day. The threat of new wars looms ever closer.

The free world became free by upholding certain principles: freedom of expression, equality before the law, unity, and respect for private property.

But when a nation **abandons the principles that make it free**, it is only a matter of time before it loses its freedom entirely.

We are witnessing the consequences in real time. In some cities of the so-called First World, shops must lock up basic goods behind glass doors to prevent theft—and I am not talking about expensive items, but things like chocolate bars or razors.

In other cities, the streets no longer belong to the people—they have fallen into the hands of homelessness, gangs, organised crime, and drug use.

You cannot claim the title of “the free world” if your citizens are not even free to walk their own streets without fear of harassment, robbery, or murder.

We are also witnessing, in real time, the **erosion of freedom of expression**. Just a decade ago, the West was the global bastion of free speech. Now, it is being lectured by the very regimes it once denounced.

The largest social media platforms have been forced to censor their users at the request of governments. Citizens in Western countries have been arrested for what they post online. Governing parties have tried to ban their political opposition.

These are not accusations or conspiracy theories. They are verifiable, documented facts.

You cannot earn the respect of the people **if you do not respect the people**.

This did not begin yesterday. But we are noticing it more because it has accelerated in recent years—and that acceleration means we are nearing a dark and dangerous tipping point.

We are entering a **new dark age of humanity**.

As Salvadorans, we know the symptoms of decline when we see them—because we have lived them all. We have passed through every stage of our nation’s fall.

And we are now seeing the same stages unfold again—this time, **on a global scale**.

### PART III

We cannot—and do not wish to—tell other countries what to do. Every nation must make its own decisions and do what is best for its people.

All we can offer is a word of caution—from a friend who has walked through darkness and fought for its life to emerge from it.

We cannot change the course of the world. El Salvador is just a small country—the smallest on the continent. This is bigger than us. In fact, it is bigger than any single nation.

We cannot prevent the dark times that lie ahead. But what we **can** do is become a **refuge in the coming storm**, and **preserve hope**.

In El Salvador, **we do not imprison our opposition**.  
We do not censor opinions.  
We do not confiscate property from those who think differently.  
We do not arrest people for expressing their views.  

In El Salvador, **your freedom of expression and your private property will always be protected**.

In El Salvador, we **prioritise the safety of innocent citizens over the comfort of criminals**.

Some say we have imprisoned thousands. But the reality is that we have **liberated millions**.

Now, **the good people live free and without fear**, with their human rights and freedoms respected.

We want our people to **prosper**. That is why we foster **innovation** and **encourage new ideas**.

We understand that for new visions to grow, a free and safe space is required—one where ideas can be tested, studied, and experimented with. A space where they are not strangled by outdated regulations or the fear of change.

In El Salvador, you will find a place to pursue your ambitions—whether in **technology, finance, medicine, energy, the arts, culture, music, or architecture**.

### CLOSING

Just a few years ago, El Salvador was **one of the darkest places on Earth**. But in a short time, our nation was **reborn**—because we reminded ourselves that **freedom is not given or gifted—it is taken**, and like all things worth having, it must be cared for and maintained.

Today, **El Salvador is a safe place for progress and innovation**—but also for **families** and for the **pursuit of meaning**.

In the new El Salvador, **everyone has a place**. We offer this safe space to our people and to all who wish to join and contribute to our vision.

It will not be easy. In fact, the next step is even harder.

We have **liberated our country**, but we must now **preserve that freedom**—and we must do so in a world that is growing ever less free.

El Salvador has left its past behind—a past to which we have sworn never to return.

It may be too late to avoid the dark times our world now faces.

But it is not too late to **build an ark**—and weather the storm.

**May God bless humanity.**

**Thank you very much.**
