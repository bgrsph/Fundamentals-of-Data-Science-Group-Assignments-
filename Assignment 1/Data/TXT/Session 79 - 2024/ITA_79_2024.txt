**Mr President, Mr Secretary-General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen,**

We are living in a very complex era, and the shared nature of the challenges of our time requires us to think in a completely new way.

The wound inflicted on the international rules-based system by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine is having destabilising effects far beyond the borders where it is being waged. Like a domino, it is reigniting or detonating other crises around the world.

Democratic political systems are facing unprecedented threats. Geo-economic fragmentation is increasing, with consequences that we all must contend with—but especially the most vulnerable nations.

The path toward reducing environmental emissions is at a crossroads, squeezed between ideological approaches and a lack of solidarity, particularly from the world’s top greenhouse gas emitters.

The scarcity of water and energy is having a deepening impact on development, food security, social stability, and entire communities.

The instrumental use of religious faith is becoming a source of tension—or worse, a cause for persecution. Millions of people around the world suffer because of their religious beliefs, and Christians are the primary victims.

We are witnessing the disruptive rise of **generative artificial intelligence**, a revolution that raises entirely new questions. Although I’m not sure we should even call it "intelligence"—for intelligence belongs to those who ask the questions, not to those who generate answers by processing data.

In any case, this is a technology that—unlike others we have seen in history—designs a world where progress no longer enhances human capabilities, but can replace them, with consequences that risk being dramatic, especially in the job market, by concentrating wealth even more.

It is no coincidence that Italy has placed this issue at the centre of its **G7 presidency**, because we want to do our part in defining a global governance model for AI—one that reconciles innovation, rights, labour, intellectual property, freedom of expression, and democracy.

This complexity, animated by deeply interconnected challenges, teaches us a fundamental truth: the problems of the so-called **Global South** are also the problems of the **Global North**, and vice versa. There are no longer homogeneous blocs, and the interdependence of our fates is a fact. That is why we are called to think beyond the frameworks we have known in the past.

The challenge is a **decisive paradigm shift** in relations among nations and in the functioning of multilateral institutions. The goal must be to build a **completely new model of cooperation**.

Personally, I am convinced that this new model **can and must** be built on a few principles—unfortunately, not to be taken for granted: **mutual respect, pragmatism, and sharing**. It means engaging with others as equals, and reclaiming the ability to listen, in order to understand one another. This is the foundation of mutual trust.

And precisely because we believe in this approach, **Italy organised all G7 presidency events in an open format**, with extensive outreach involving **all continents**, the **G20**, the **African Union**, **international financial institutions**, and **multilateral development banks**. We showed that the G7 is not a fortress closed off in defence, but rather a platform of values **open to the world**.

I think of the **turning point Italy has made in its relations with the African continent**. At the bilateral level, we have made our **investment plan for Africa**, the **Mattei Plan**, operational, with **pilot projects in nine countries** across the continent, establishing **strategic partnerships** with each of them.

We have structured **operational synergies** with the **EU’s Global Gateway** and the **G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment**.

We have developed **new financial instruments** in cooperation with the **African Development Bank** and the **World Bank**, enabling the mobilisation of both public and private resources.

We have conceived **innovative solutions**, such as the **Apulia Food Security Initiative**, to enhance agricultural production and food security; and **Energy for Growth in Africa**, to support the production and distribution of clean energy. We have decided to back **strategic projects** for Africa, such as the **Lobito Corridor**.

We have done all this while **never ceasing to engage with our African partners**, listening and collaborating. Our goal is not to impose—but to **share**. Together, we choose priorities, sectors, and fields of action. Where we could offer added value, we did—bringing our perspective and our collaboration, through **concrete projects** that are already yielding results.

- In **Algeria**, we will reclaim **36,000 hectares of desert land** for cultivation and build a **local supply chain** for processing and production.
- In **Kenya**, we are developing a **biofuel supply chain** that will, by the end of 2025, support up to **200,000 small farming enterprises**.
- In **Ethiopia**, we are undertaking **major environmental restoration work** around **Lake Boye** in the west of the country.

Because—and I want to repeat this clearly—our goal, in the face of **tens of thousands of people undertaking desperate journeys to enter Europe illegally**, is first and foremost to guarantee their **right not to be forced to emigrate**, not to be uprooted simply because they have no alternative.

Their desperation is being exploited by increasingly powerful, far-reaching **criminal organisations**.  
A year ago, from this very podium, I proposed declaring a **global war on human traffickers**. I am pleased that my appeal did not fall on deaf ears, and that, starting with the G7, we reached an agreement to launch **international coordination** to dismantle these criminal networks.

But more must be done. **The United Nations must do more**, because these criminal networks are **reviving, in new forms, the practice of slavery**—the commodification of human beings—which this Assembly once played a fundamental role in eradicating.  
**We must not go backward.**

Defeating the **slave-traders of the third millennium is possible**, but only if we **join forces**, enhance cooperation, and develop **joint initiatives** among our police forces, intelligence agencies, and judicial authorities, using the approach known as **"follow the money."**

This is a principle developed by two great Italian judges, **Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino**, which has become a **global model for combating organised crime**.

It is a method that Italy intends to use to **strengthen cooperation with Latin American nations** as well.

Because there is a **common thread** connecting the human traffickers in Africa with the **drug cartels in Latin America**, and with those who commit the horrific crime of **kidnapping children for sexual slavery**, robbing them of their present and their future.

Latin America, where—just as in other parts of the world—**legitimate aspirations for freedom and democracy** remain unfulfilled for tens of millions of people.  
I am thinking in particular of the **Venezuelan people**, to whom we extend our full **solidarity and support**.

The international community **cannot stand idly by** while, nearly two months after the elections on **28 July**, the results have yet to be recognised; while we witness **brutal repression**, the killing of demonstrators, **mass arrests of opposition figures**, and the **indictment and exile of the democratic opposition’s presidential candidate**.  
It is our **duty** to speak out.

**Dear friends**,  

In **2025**, we will celebrate the **80th anniversary of the United Nations Charter**—a Charter that enshrines principles and values which, in our time, have been **openly challenged**, even by a **permanent member of the Security Council**. But Italy has **no intention of retreating** in its defence of these principles and values—because they exist to **protect everyone**, especially those **nations with fewer means of self-defence**.

As always, **the law must apply equally to all**, because that is the only way to truly defend the most vulnerable.

That is why **we cannot look the other way** when it comes to **Ukraine’s right to defend its borders, its sovereignty, and its freedom**.  
Just as we affirm **Israel’s right to defend itself** from external attacks—such as the **horrific assault on 7 October**—we also call on **Israel** to **respect international law**, and to **protect civilians**, who are themselves, in large part, **victims of Hamas and its destructive choices**.

And following the same reasoning, **we support the Palestinian people’s right to their own state**.  
But for this to become a reality, the Palestinian people must entrust their cause to a **leadership committed to dialogue**, to **Middle East stability**, and to **governance that seeks peace**.

The **Abraham Accords** have shown that peaceful **coexistence and cooperation** based on **mutual recognition** is possible.  
If that is the vision we must all work toward—and it is—then the **immediate priority** is to **achieve a ceasefire in Gaza without delay**, and to ensure the **immediate release of the Israeli hostages**.  
We can no longer stand by as tragedies unfold like those in **southern and eastern Lebanon**, where **innocent civilians, including many children**, have been caught in the crossfire.

That said, the upcoming **80th anniversary** must be a **historic opportunity** for all of us:  
To finally acknowledge that, **like it or not**, the problems of today affect and involve **every one of us**.

We must be willing to **question ourselves**, with **humility and awareness**.  
And that requires **serious reflection on multilateralism**—on the **capacity of international organisations** to be equal to this era and to the challenges it presents.

I am speaking, of course, of the United Nations—of its capacity to reform itself based not on what is easiest, but on what is **useful and necessary**.

Italy believes that any reform of the UN’s functional architecture—**starting with the Security Council**—must be based on the principles of **equality, democracy, and representativeness**.

It would be a mistake to create **new hierarchies** through **new permanent seats**.  
We are open to discussing reform with **no preconditions**, but we want a reform that leads to **better representation for all**, not better representation for some.

**Colleagues, delegates, ladies and gentlemen,**

We have been called to lead our nations in **challenging times**.  
Everything around us seems to be changing.  
Everything is being questioned.  
Even the few certainties we thought we had, we no longer hold.

Fate is testing us—but perhaps, it is doing so **to challenge our courage and resolve**.

In the midst of the storm, we have the chance to **prove ourselves equal to the task history has placed before us**.  
To prove it to the **citizens we govern**.  
To **our children**.  
And, perhaps most of all, **to ourselves**.

As a great Italian patriot of our Risorgimento, **Carlo Pisacane**, once said:

> **"I shall find every reward in the depths of my own conscience."**

To **face problems rather than postpone them**.  
To **move forward rather than retreat**.  
To **prefer what is right over what is easy**—  
This is our task. **Difficult, yes—but necessary.**

**Italy, as always, stands ready to do its part.**

**Thank you.**
