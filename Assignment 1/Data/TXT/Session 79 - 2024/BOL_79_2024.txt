Thank you very much, Mr President.

1. I begin this statement by greeting the President of the General Assembly, Mr Philemon Yang, the Secretary-General, Mr António Guterres, and all the delegations present.  
Mr President, distinguished colleagues,  

2. Today we meet at a challenging time for humanity. We face not one, but multiple crises that threaten both our present and the future of upcoming generations—from climate change to inequality, pandemics, geopolitical conflicts, and democratic crises. These crises feed off each other, deepening vulnerabilities and presenting challenges that require urgent, coordinated, and collective responses.

3. The current global economy is exacerbating inequalities. The model of capital accumulation—based on the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few—has increased poverty, marginalisation, and social instability in many parts of the world. While financial markets continue to generate enormous profits for the global elite, the wealthiest 1%, millions of people struggle to access the most basic resources. This is not only an economic crisis—it is also an ethical and social one. It exposes the deep structural failures of a capitalist system that prioritises profit over life, well-being, and Mother Earth.

4. Wars, weapons production, massive military spending, and the proliferation of arms not only divert vast resources that could be directed towards sustainable development but also fuel conflicts that intensify human suffering. Billions of dollars are spent on weapons, while millions lack access to essential services like education, health, food, and water. Rather than solving our common problems, this fosters global instability and hinders progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

5. The environmental crisis is one of the greatest threats we face—and our actions are still insufficient. Global warming, deforestation, pollution, and biodiversity loss are devastating our ecosystems. These phenomena also directly impact millions of lives through increasingly intense extreme weather events—droughts, floods, and hurricanes—that affect local communities and Indigenous peoples.

Mr President,  

6. The unprecedented technological transformation, including the development of new technologies and artificial intelligence (AI), is reshaping the way we interact, work, and navigate our daily lives. However, this technological revolution also raises profound questions about global governance in a world where technological power is concentrated in the hands of a few corporations and countries. Global governance must adapt to ensure that these technologies are used equitably, ethically, and in service of humanity's well-being—rather than exacerbating inequality or introducing new forms of exclusion and control.

Brothers and sisters of the world,  

7. In the face of these crises, we must act decisively to collectively confront global challenges. It is time to rethink our development models, strengthen multilateral institutions, protect the planet for future generations, and ensure that justice, equity, and solidarity are the guiding principles of our actions—always upholding international law and the United Nations Charter.

8. The system that has governed the world order since the end of World War II has proven insufficient to address today’s challenges, such as climate change, inequality, regional conflicts, pandemics, and new forms of economic interdependence. Therefore, a new world order—based on effective multilateral cooperation, respect for the sovereignty of all countries, and equity in global decision-making—is imperative.

9. To this end, a profound restructuring of international institutions such as the UN Security Council is necessary—so that they are more democratic and representative. We must move toward a system where global decisions are made inclusively, respecting diverse perspectives and the needs of developing countries.

10. In the same spirit, we must deeply reform the international financial architecture. This should be centred on economic justice, sustainability, and inclusion—creating fairer mechanisms for sovereign debt restructuring, increasing the participation of developing countries in financial institutions, and promoting financial flows that support sustainable development and climate action. It is also essential to redesign international tax cooperation mechanisms so that vulnerable economies have access to the resources needed to confront multiple crises. Restructuring the international financial system is not just a technical issue—it is an ethical and political necessity to build a more equitable, resilient, and solidaristic global economy.

11. The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) remain valid and are a crucial roadmap for addressing today’s urgent global challenges. They provide us with a clear framework for international action and cooperation. Despite the delays in implementation, we must redouble our efforts and strengthen our collective commitment to ensure that this ambitious plan becomes a tangible reality that transforms the lives of our peoples.

12. The *Pact for the Future* must become a historic opportunity to rethink our path as humanity. It compels us to pursue an agenda that not only addresses immediate problems but also drives sustainable, inclusive, and equitable solutions for future generations. The Pact for the Future must not end with diplomatic meetings—it is now our task to bring these decisions to life, to energise the SDGs, and to make real changes in our communities and cities.

13. Sustainable development and climate change are two sides of the same challenge that will define the future of our planet and future generations. Action does not only mean reducing emissions—it means transforming our models of production and consumption, protecting biodiversity, and ensuring that economic progress leaves no one behind.

Mr President, distinguished colleagues,  

14. Bolivia sees the international community as a space of solidarity and cooperation under the principles of international law and the UN Charter. In this context, we reject unilateral coercive measures that violate fundamental human rights and hinder the development of many nations. We express our solidarity with Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and all other countries unjustly subjected to such sanctions.

15. Likewise, we strongly condemn the economic, financial, and commercial blockade imposed by the United States against our brother nation, Cuba. Sixty years of injustice have not been enough to punish a people that have courageously resisted imperial power’s attempts at domination. We are confident that, sooner rather than later, justice and truth will prevail. This injustice is further compounded by the unilateral inclusion of Cuba on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. Cuba should instead top the list of the most supportive nations in the world, as its solidarity has reached every corner of the planet.

Mr President,  

16. For decades, Palestine has suffered a prolonged conflict that has undermined regional stability and shattered dreams of a just and lasting peace. Occupation, forced displacement, and genocide have brought the Palestinian people to a state of devastation—turning their land into an open-air prison for thousands, especially children and women.

17. Peace and security in Palestine will not be achieved without a genuine commitment to human rights and an end to genocide. Bolivia reiterates its full support for the exercise of Palestinian self-determination and independence, within the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital. We hope to see Palestine soon become a full member of the United Nations.

Mr President, brothers and sisters of the world,  

18. In this Assembly, I reaffirm Bolivia’s commitment to the fundamental principles of the UN Charter and international law. We recognise the UN as the leading multilateral body created by humanity for development, peace, and security—not only within our borders, but globally.

19. Accordingly, Bolivia reaffirms its firm intention to comply with all decisions and rulings issued by international judicial bodies. Along these lines, Bolivia approached the International Court of Justice in The Hague regarding sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. The Court urged Bolivia and Chile to continue dialogue and exchanges, in a spirit of good neighbourliness, to address matters concerning sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean—a solution that both parties have recognised as a matter of mutual interest. The Court called on both countries to resolve the issue through dialogue in a way that benefits both peoples, with the goal of restoring Bolivia’s sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean, from which it enjoyed access at the time of its declaration of independence, as the Court acknowledged in its ruling. My country is willing to engage in dialogue when our counterpart so decides. We believe the sea is a right of peoples.

Mr President,  

20. Bolivia calls on the international community to protect and support Indigenous peoples, who have long been guardians of biodiversity and ancestral knowledge. They now face compounded vulnerabilities from overlapping crises. It is important to acknowledge their contributions to climate action—their knowledge and practices offer us a new development model to live well (*Vivir Bien*) in harmony with Mother Earth.

21. In this context, I wish to share our concern over the negative classification of the coca leaf, which for our Indigenous and peasant communities is a fundamental part of our identity and culture.

22. Furthermore, we propose continuing to advance and deepen gender and social policy, incorporating the lenses of decolonisation and depatriarchalisation—tools that will help transform power structures and social relations that have perpetuated gender inequality and the oppression of women.

23. Today, on behalf of the Bolivian people and our constitutional President, Luis Arce Catacora, we reaffirm our democratic conviction and commitment to the well-being of the Bolivian people, to achieve the 2030 Agenda and *Vivir Bien* in harmony with Mother Earth as soon as possible.

24. We regret that internal and external interests are currently creating conflict in our country and attempting to destabilise a democratic government. But we are confident that with your support and solidarity, we will preserve and strengthen our democracy and institutions.

25. Bolivia is a people that has shown throughout its history that its democratic spirit is unbreakable. Strengthening our institutions and ensuring a future of peace, stability, and progress for all is our sole objective.

**Jallalla the peoples of the world!**  
**Thank you very much.**
