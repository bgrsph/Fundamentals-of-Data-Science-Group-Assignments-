**Mr Philémon Yang, President of the UN General Assembly,  
Mr António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations,  
Distinguished delegates,  
Mr President,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,**

At the outset, it gives me great pleasure to extend my heartfelt congratulations on your election as President of the 79th Session of the UN General Assembly, wishing you and your team success in your important mission. I also express sincere thanks and appreciation to Mr Dennis Francis for his distinguished leadership during the previous session, and to Secretary-General António Guterres for his continued efforts to promote international peace and stability, his good offices in pursuit of the United Nations' noble goals, and his role in advancing human rights.

**Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen,**

Libya has, for more than a decade, experienced successive transitional phases marked by conflicts and unjustified wars between brothers, fuelled by foreign interventions aimed at weakening the state, deepening internal divisions, and controlling its natural resources and political and economic decision-making. This compels us to take a serious stand to restore control. The challenges before us remain considerable and complex, and we are still striving to create consensual solutions, unify ranks, bring the parties together at one table, and work toward a national solution.

However, the **institutional division**, resulting from the deliberate obstruction of the political process by certain parties—followed by disputes over powers and mandates—has exacerbated the political and institutional crisis and further complicated the political landscape. This includes the creation of parallel entities, the freezing or cancellation of political agreements and relevant Security Council resolutions, and the use of state resources as a means of political pressure—most recently, attempts to undermine Libya’s judiciary. This obliges us to bear the responsibility entrusted to us and intervene when the **citizen’s security and livelihood** are at stake.

**Mr President,**

A comprehensive political solution—encompassing financial, economic, and security tracks, in addition to the national reconciliation process—is the only path to unifying institutions and ensuring stability, culminating in elections and the renewal of legitimacy across all institutions. We value the national and international efforts supporting dialogue between Libyan parties and firmly believe that the **Libyan people alone** have the right to determine their destiny and choose their leadership and governance. They must be given the opportunity to determine their future through renewed legitimacy and the restoration of their authority—something certain parties are seeking to exclude. **Libyans are best placed to decide their future**, and the people are the ultimate arbiter in choosing their representatives. The path back to them through **fair referenda and comprehensive elections** is the best way to end any political deadlock.

**Ladies and Gentlemen,**

The **national reconciliation project**, sponsored by the Presidential Council, has progressed slowly due to recent developments in the country and the deliberate obstruction by some political actors. We reaffirm the importance of accelerating this process to foster and consolidate trust. In this regard, we commend the efforts of the **African Union** and call for the launch of a **Libyan-led dialogue** to produce a **national charter and a comprehensive reconciliation conference**. We emphasise the need for **constructive participation from all parties**, in order to reach a peaceful settlement based on a Libyan-Libyan solution, free from foreign interference or imposition. Lasting solutions cannot be achieved without **frank and serious dialogue among Libyans themselves**, in a way that guarantees **the country’s unity, societal cohesion, and sovereignty**.

**Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen,**

This month marks the **first anniversary of the devastation** that struck parts of the city of **Derna and its surrounding areas** as a result of **Storm Daniel**—an unforgettable and painful event that caused widespread destruction and heavy human and material losses. Despite the grief and sorrow, we also remember the solidarity and unity shown by Libyans, which offered a vivid lesson in the **Libyan people’s ability to overcome hardship and crises**—when they choose to solve their problems internally and without external interference. We reiterate our support for the **sincere efforts undertaken for recovery and reconstruction** across the country.

**Ladies and Gentlemen,**

The crimes of **genocide and ethnic cleansing** being committed by the **Israeli occupation** against the **Palestinian and Lebanese peoples** represent a flagrant violation of international law. We remain committed to the principles of **accountability** and **non-impunity**. In this regard, we draw attention to Libya’s decision to join **South Africa** in the case brought before the **International Criminal Court** concerning Israel’s gross violations of international laws, resolutions, and treaties. This step aims to strengthen accountability for the **violations and genocide** suffered by the Palestinian people.

We also stress that the **only way to avert a wider regional war** is to address the situation in **Gaza**, halting the grave violations and assaults occurring in **Palestine**. We affirm the **Palestinian people’s right to self-determination** and the establishment of an **independent Palestinian state**, with **Jerusalem as its capital**.

**Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen,**

On the regional and international levels, we emphasise the need for **concerted efforts to combat irregular migration and terrorism**. This issue poses a major challenge not only to Libya, but to many countries—particularly African nations and others in the region. As a **transit country**, Libya bears a **heavy burden** in this regard.

We believe that resolving this issue requires **joint efforts**, while also taking into account **national legislation**, **humanitarian dimensions**, and the **protection of migrants' rights**.

As for **terrorism**, Libya has suffered greatly from this scourge and has successfully eliminated **ISIS** thanks to the sacrifices of its people, the efforts of its military institutions, and the support of the international community. We continue working to **enhance internal security and protect our borders**, in cooperation with international partners, by establishing **security coordination centres** among national security forces and neighbouring countries.

The fight against terrorism is not merely a military one—it is a **multifaceted phenomenon** requiring both local and international cooperation, and a **comprehensive approach** that addresses its various dimensions. While we value the efforts of the United Nations in this field, we stress the importance of developing **a national mechanism** to confront these challenges—**free from negative foreign interference**.

**Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen,**

To the **honourable Libyan people**, I say:  
The time has come for us to **unite our ranks**, to **build bridges of unity**, and to make our **solidarity the cornerstone of our homeland**—a generous nation, home to a noble people who love life.

Let me say this clearly:  
We **cannot enjoy the blessings of our resources, our wealth, and our homeland** so long as the seeds of division and discord continue to grow among us.

**Our unity is the key to our stability.**  
It is the **hope** that will carry our children toward a better future.

I urge you to **cling to our national unity** and to reject external interventions that seek to **undermine our efforts**.  
History bears witness to the greatness of this people—a people who have inspired nations and civilisations through the ages, and who, despite all the challenges they have endured, **always return stronger, more determined, and more resilient**.

The Libyan people **do not forget those who stood by them** in times of hardship. And we shall remain faithful to our commitment to build **a bright future** worthy of our people’s aspirations and the hopes of our nation.  
**We will spare no sacrifice in pursuit of that goal.**

**Peace be upon you.**
