Mr. President,
•     As a country that was one of the fifty-one founding members of the United Nations, Ethiopia is a strong proponent of effective  multilateralism centered on the United Nations. Ethiopia views with  grave concern the challenges the United Nations faces in discharging its role in peace and security, and socio-economic development.
•     Nevertheless, ensuring readiness and capability of the United Nations to resolve global challenges has been a generational quest. Five years into the establishment of the United Nations, in the year 1950, Ethiopia in its policy statement stated to this august Assembly, "we are filled with anxiety concerning the surprises which the future may hold in store, fears that the United Nations may be called upon to face events even more serious than those of the present time and that such problems may greatly exceed its powers and capacity."
•     That future is now! We are faced with persisting peace and security challenges across the globe. There is a devastating existential threat emanating from arms race, extreme poverty, inequality, and climate change. At the same time, global commitment to the Sustainable  Development Goals is receding and the debt crisis in developing countries is worsening. Furthermore, our constrained ability to manage the emerging multi-polar world carries the risk of undermining multilateralism.
•     As envisaged, the United Nations is called upon to face challenges that are proving to exceed its powers and capacities. It is our view that collective security will be realized if states are able to exercise their  authority and carry out their responsibilities to safeguard their national security. The conventional dictates, including peacekeeping missions, can deliver the desired results when we prioritize support for national efforts and capabilities. We must therefore, at all times preserve the sovereignty and political independence of states as the foundation for effective collective security. We also call for greater economic and security cooperation among member states, which is pivotal to empowering national institutions.
•     The shortcomings of the United Nations reflect the reluctance on the part of the international community to promote the effective realization of the principles and purposes of the Charter. The United Nations should be at the center of efforts to resolve global peace and security challenges. Without a substantial role of the United Nations  guided by the principles of the Charter, we risk making the General Assembly a non-consequential platform with no guarantee for a positive contribution to global peace and security. On its part, the United Nations should play its role by demonstrating impartiality, independence, competence, and credibility among all its members.
•     Furthermore, we underscore the urgency to reform the United Nations  Security Council and its working methods. The reform of the Security Council is not only about rectifying the injustice done to Africa but also about the credibility of the Council itself. The impacts of Africa's  exclusion and the Security Council's inability to discharge its cardinal  responsibilities manifest in its disproportionate focus on the internal affairs of African countries. In addition, the Council's lukewarm  attitude towards regional solutions; and the implementation of measures detached from reality on the ground are results of Africa's non representation. We, therefore, call on member states to commit to  prioritizing Africa's representation in both categories of membership of the UN Security Council with all the rights and prerogatives as articulated under Africa's common position. There is no shortcut or half solution to this longstanding quest for equality.
Mr. President,
•     The African Union has designed Agenda 2063 as a blue print for the continents' development. The agenda is being implemented in synchronization with the UN Agenda 2030. The fact that the SDGs are off-track mostly due to lack of financing is a source of concern for Africa. The compounding debt crisis also requires urgent and sustainable solution. Therefore, those member states with impact on global financial institutions should make the necessary financial resources available.
•     On its part, Ethiopia has been consistent in its efforts to achieve these development goals. In parallel with resolving a complex security challenge through an African Union-facilitated peace process, Ethiopia has redoubled its efforts to forge peace and development. We are making progress in poverty eradication and realizing people centred development. We introduced transformational shifts to our monetary and economic policies and to advance our digital infrastructure.
•     We are confident our development path will bring about great benefits to our people. We call on all actors in development finance to work with us with a sense of solidarity and cooperation to navigate the challenges of reform and attain sustainable economic growth and development.
Mr. Presdient,
•     I have the distinct pleasure to announce to this Assembly the milestone the Nile River Basin have achieved this year. The Cooperative Framework Agreement of the Nile River Basin (CFA) is poised to enter into force with the required number of ratifications. The entry into force of this first-ever Nile River Basin-wide treaty - the Cooperative Framework Agreement - will pave the way for sustained cooperation and shared growth across the entire river basin. Ethiopia along with its co-riparian sisterly countries will work towards the realization of the principles of the CFA and the full potential of the Nile River. This development, coupled with the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam that is generating electricty meetings the energy demands of Ethiopia and the Eastern Africa Region will bring us closer to this objective. It is our sincere hope that the remaining riparian countries will join the treaty and play a constructive role in ensuring equitable and reasonable utilization of the Nile River.
  I am also proud to announce to this august Assembly that the Ethiopian Green Legacy, the notable initiative of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed saw the planting of over forty billion seedlings within five years, increasing our forest coverage from 3 to 24 percent. This stands  as a substantial global contribution to the absorption of Green-house  gases and a tangible measure against the adverse impacts of climate change. Based on its Long-term Low Emissions Development Strategy, Ethiopia is also on the path to sustainable energy transformation by developing and transitioning to non-fossil fuel energy sources. Such efforts must be supported by the full activation of the global  commitments especially through the provision of adequate climate financing. 
Mr. President,
•     Maritime insecurity in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean is a source of  great concern for Ethiopia. With over 120 million population and  significant maritime trade, Ethiopia entirely depends on the safe and secure maritime activity in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. This region is threatened by conflicts, piracy, and other illicit activities. Over the years, Ethiopia has played an instrumental role in combating the causes of insecurity. We also continue our efforts to work with our neighbors to contribute on a durable basis to ensure peaceful navigation on the high seas. We see a great need to chart a new path for inclusive maritime security engagement with equal participation of countries with stakes on both sides of the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.
•     Furthermore, terrorism continues to be a grave threat to the peace and security of the Horn of Africa. The growing rise of violent extremist  groups like Al-Shabab and its international affiliates have continued their vicious attacks against civilians and security of the region.
•     The region has reached a milestone in degrading terrorism owing to the resilience of the people of Somalia and the sacrifices of the sons and daughters of Burundi, Djibouti, Kenya, Uganda, and my country Ethiopia. The authorization of the Security Council and the international finance for the African Union Peace Support operation have indeed played an instrumental role. 
•     The recent maneuvers of actors from outside the Horn of Africa region undermine these efforts. Nevertheless, Ethiopia will not be deterred  from its resolute commitment to combatting terrorism. We therefore call upon these actors to immediately stop their reckless actions. We  also call on the international community to recognize the imminent risk originating from these irresponsible acts and to take concrete  measures to prevent the loss of hard-won gains in combating terrorism in the Horn of Africa.
Mr. President,
•     In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Ethiopia's commitment to the maintenance of global peace and security and upholding multilateralism.
Thank you!
