Thank you, Mr President.  
We gather once again under the auspices of our United Nations organisation, while our world passes through a turning point of profound sensitivity, urgency, and danger:

A turning point marked by the accumulation of conflicts, crises, and wars;  
by a widening development gap between North and South;  
by the worsening severity of climate change and environmental threats in all their forms.

Amidst a tendency to resolve disputes through force, the excessive and selective use of unilateral punitive measures, failure to fulfil binding commitments, disregard for international legitimacy, and the worsening polarisation that has diminished the role of the Security Council and undermined multilateral international cooperation in its entirety.

And, last but not least, a turning point that puts to the test the entire system of international relations—its foundations, principles, and rules as codified in the Charter of the United Nations, and the mechanisms, institutions, and structures we have established to serve our collective aspirations and goals.

From this perspective, approaching the United Nations' eighth decade must be a chance to reaffirm our commitment to the system that unites us.



A global system based on the **rule of law, not the rule of force**;  
on the **power of law, not the law of power**;  
on the **strength of reason, not the reasoning of strength**.

Today, more than ever, we need to renew our adherence to the UN Charter and its rules—and to abide by them.

What is happening in Gaza—a continuing genocide now approaching one year in duration—and the spillover of this war into the West Bank and, most recently, into Lebanon; what is unfolding across the region in terms of escalating, multifaceted Israeli aggression—**none of this would have happened** had the international community taken a firm and timely stance to compel the Israeli occupation to accept the same punitive and deterrent measures imposed on others under Chapter VII of our organisation’s Charter.

It is incumbent upon the international community today to urgently act to end the **hell imposed on the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples**, and to restrain the Israeli occupier and its pursuit of dragging the Middle East into a perpetual vortex of crisis, conflict, and unending war.

This is a pivotal and historic moment—**a moment that cannot be undone**.

It is a moment that tolerates neither hesitation nor delay in supporting the national project and a moment that cannot bear procrastination or stalling in the push toward the establishment of an **independent, sovereign Palestinian state** as the just, lasting, and final solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

From this very podium, in the previous session, the President of the Republic, **Mr Abdelmadjid Tebboune**, called upon our United Nations to accelerate the granting of **full membership** to the State of Palestine. That was during a time of less turbulence, crisis, and tragedy in the occupied Palestinian territories and the broader region.

But today—at what is undeniably the darkest moment in the history of the Palestinian cause—this step has become an **urgent and inevitable necessity**.

Full membership for Palestine in this organisation is a **decisive step** toward preserving the two-state solution, confronting Israeli efforts to undermine or eliminate it, and safeguarding the fundamentals of resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict and the region’s security and stability.

As for developments in the regional neighbourhood, **Algeria remains convinced** that addressing the complex challenges faced by the nations and peoples of the region requires **international support and global solidarity** to confront the burdens weighing on our shared African space.

This applies particularly to the **Sahel-Sahara region**, which endures fragile conditions due to escalating political instability, growing terrorist threats, and the deepening of poverty and absence of sustainable development opportunities, along with the worsening of migration flows.

In light of this situation, Algeria **reaffirms its full solidarity** with all the nations and peoples of the Sahel-Sahara region, emphasising its steadfast belief that their security, stability, and prosperity are inseparable from the security, stability, and prosperity of their broader regional environment.

Unfortunately, a representative of one of the states in this region recently made **a disgraceful and indecent statement** targeting my country—words entirely unworthy of the dignity of this forum, and utterly beneath the decorum of international discourse.

My country will not respond to such coarse and vulgar language in kind. Instead, it responds with **respectful and refined language**, a language that reflects the **genuine loyalty and deep commitment** Algeria maintains toward the rooted ties that unite it with the nations and peoples of the region—ties that transcend temporary circumstances and are not undermined by the petty provocations of those who seek to inflame them.

**Algeria possesses both a resolute will and an outstretched hand**, always open to engagement with our brothers and neighbours to build a **Sahelian structure founded on peace, stability, and prosperity**.

Within this same region, **Algeria reaffirms its call for the final eradication of colonialism**, by closing the last remaining chapter that still, regrettably, stands open in **Western Sahara**.

We fully support the UN Secretary-General and his personal envoy in their efforts to enable the two parties to the conflict — **the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front** — to resume direct negotiations aimed at reaching a **political solution** that guarantees the Sahrawi people their **inalienable and imprescriptible right to self-determination**.

To those who wager on **entrenching a colonial status quo** through delay tactics, the distortion of clear facts, and the multiplication of desperate manoeuvres, we say: **colonialism is destined to end—sooner or later**.

The legitimate rights of the Sahrawi people will find their way forward, sooner rather than later.

Regarding our neighbour **Libya**, Algeria affirms the need for urgent action to overcome the political deadlock that fuels internal conflict. Only then will Libyans be able to unite around a **consensual foundation** to realise transparent and inclusive national goals—goals in service of the highest objective we all cherish: **a unified Libya in its people, land, government, and institutions**.

At the **continental level**, Algeria continues to work toward a meaningful contribution to **pan-African action**, guided by the strategic priorities defined decisively by the African Union’s agenda.

Africa seeks, first and foremost, **African-devised and African-led solutions** to silence the guns and resolve the many crises and conflicts that plague the continent’s nations and peoples.



Secondly, Africa aspires to overcome the challenges of **economic development** and to join the **ongoing revolutions in artificial intelligence and digital technology**.

Thirdly, Africa seeks to advance its **strategic priorities** in reforming the international financial, monetary, and banking institutions, so as to:

- Improve African representation within them;  
- Address the structural roots of global debt; and  
- Secure development financing suited to the continent’s needs.

Fourth and finally, Africa demands redress for the **historic injustice** imposed on it at the **UN Security Council**, through the rightful allocation of African seats on that body.

With the same level of commitment on the continental stage, Algeria also continues to engage with its **Mediterranean neighbourhood**, and with the **European Union** in particular.

We seek a partnership rooted in the **balance of mutual interests and full equality**,  
a partnership that prioritises **support for economic development** in our country, free from conditions, restrictions, or barriers.


Today, **Algeria is advancing steadily and prudently** along the sound path laid down by the President of the Republic, **Mr Abdelmadjid Tebboune**, to consolidate political and institutional stability, build a strong and diversified national economy that ends dependency on hydrocarbons, and to strengthen the **social character of the Algerian state**—a fundamental principle and proud legacy of our national liberation revolution.

This path has already borne fruit in the form of increased national stability and the entrenchment of democracy—especially through the most recent presidential elections. It has also laid the foundations for a **comprehensive economic renaissance**, restoring Algeria’s status as one of Africa’s top three economies, and opening wide the doors to profitable cooperation and partnerships for all.

In light of these achievements, Algeria is working to **strengthen its relations with all brotherly, friendly, and partner countries**, both within and beyond our regional affiliations.

My country is also determined to continue **close cooperation with all UN member states** who share our commitment to upholding the principles and values enshrined in the United Nations Charter.

Despite the deep and perilous crises afflicting the world today—crises that shake even the strongest wills and weigh heavily upon the most resolute—there is still room for hope and opportunity. From the depths of crisis arise new possibilities; from suffering, determination is born; and **from hardship emerges hope**—hope for a better tomorrow for present and future generations alike.

**Thank you, Mr President.**
