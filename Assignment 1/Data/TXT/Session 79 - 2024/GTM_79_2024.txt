- Honourable Delegates,  
- Ladies and Gentlemen,

*Ri’ siguan tinamit paxil kayala ku ya rutzil uwach ri uwachulew.*  
*(The people of Guatemala greet the world.)*

I greet you in the language of the K’iche’ people—one of the largest and most influential ancestral communities in Guatemala. Their strength, along with that of Guatemala’s many diverse peoples, is the foundation of our government. It is the force that drives our nation. It is the resounding voice of those who have not been heard, of those who have been marginalised—yet who have much to say, much to contribute, and who have a rightful place in the building of our collective future.

I stand here as the result of two clear expressions of popular will. The first was a vote that decisively rejected the representatives of Guatemala’s authoritarian past and its legacy of corruption, granting me the honour of the presidency and the responsibility of leading a national effort toward a future of justice, equality, and progress.

The second was the defence, by Guatemalan society in all its forms, of that electoral decision—affirmed and upheld in the streets when a corrupt minority sought to impose itself and defraud our democracy.

Our democracy would not be complete—indeed, it could not exist—without the determined and courageous drive of the Mayan peoples, of the mestizo people, of the Garifuna people of the Caribbean, and of the Xinca people. It is a democracy that comes from the four cardinal directions, from the four peoples, from the whole nation. And it is the role of our government to give unity to that diversity, and to move us forward into a prosperous and inclusive future.

I want to express Guatemala’s heartfelt gratitude to the countries, peoples, and governments that stood with us—and with the people of Guatemala—through the historic events of 2023, and who continue to support our efforts to rescue and restore democratic institutions.

We are doing this through dialogue. A dialogue framed by a broad national consensus—something that all Guatemalans share, beyond ideological differences, cultural diversity, and the many ways in which we perceive and interpret the world.

And I am certain that this forum can identify with that consensus: we can no longer tolerate corruption. Corruption—when the few abuse what belongs to all to enrich themselves—is like an anchor dragging us backwards. It prevents us from growing, from prospering, from building a society grounded in the common good.

In Guatemala, corruption is rooted in an authoritarian past—one of repression, political violence, and social exclusion. But we are freeing ourselves. We are breaking the chains of a dark past, and a young, creative, vibrant, joyful, and restless nation is emerging. A youth that refuses to remain silent in the face of injustice and corruption. A diverse community building a future in which everyone has a place, where opportunities multiply, and where collaboration and solidarity amplify creativity, ingenuity, and personal effort. A future in which parents can sleep peacefully, knowing their children will have access to healthcare and education. A future in which work is fairly rewarded, and prosperity does not require immoral acts or corruption. A future in which our Earth is treated with respect and gratitude—and in return, offers clean spaces for us to work, live, rest, and grow. That is the future we are building for Guatemala.

This future does not emerge from a vacuum. We have envisioned it by looking inward—to our values, our principles, our worldviews. Our government belongs to the diverse peoples of Guatemala, and it is through their values and visions that we will navigate this sea of transformation.

In the same spirit, this forum—which is so vital to global coexistence and the advancement of all nations—must also look inward. It must reclaim its foundational values and use them to chart a course through the complex reality we face today. It is time to rescue multilateralism, to revitalise dialogue for peace, and to take concrete action to address the urgent crises before us.

Let us begin at the root: war—the horror that led to the founding of this global forum—has once again seized our attention. While it has never disappeared, its intensity has surged unexpectedly over the past two years. We must not tolerate it.

We must not ignore international conflicts that threaten peace and security for all. We must never abandon the hope of a world without war—a future in peace.

Guatemala reaffirms its solidarity with nations suffering from armed conflict and unjustified wars. We call on the members of this Assembly to redouble regional and international efforts to find peaceful solutions to disputes—solutions rooted in international law, international humanitarian law, and the fundamental principle of human dignity.

We cannot accept violations of the United Nations Charter or of Security Council resolutions—by any Member State of this organisation—whether in Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan, or anywhere else in the world.

**Ladies and Gentlemen,**

Rescuing multilateralism as a guiding principle of the international system is an urgent necessity. For each nation represented in this forum, it is also an inescapable commitment if we are to realise a future of peace and progress.

Only with substantive reform can we return to the path envisioned in 1945. In a multipolar world, we need new approaches that respond to the evolving needs of nations. We support the reform of the Security Council—so that it adopts a more collective, peaceful, and democratic approach to its work.

It is unacceptable that decisions in favour of peace are blocked by the prerogative of a few—I refer to the right of veto—which has prevented firm action against States that repeatedly violate this organisation’s Charter.

We remind members of the Security Council of their primary responsibility to maintain international peace and security, and that in fulfilling this duty, they must act in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations.

**Mr President,**

Guatemala contributes to peace through action: we currently deploy 213 officers—military observers and staff officers—to seven United Nations peacekeeping missions. This is a contribution of which we are proud. Our professionalism and field experience have earned us international recognition as one of the leading peace-contributing nations in Latin America and the Caribbean.

I share with this Assembly that we are finalising the necessary administrative arrangements to deploy a military police contingent as part of the Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti, pursuant to Security Council Resolution 2699 (2023). Guatemala stands ready to support all efforts aimed at restoring peace and stability in Haiti—the first modern independent nation in this hemisphere—with which all American states share a historical sense of responsibility.

We have long understood that an assault on human dignity anywhere is an assault on all humanity. Peace is a global imperative. We can all contribute—and we must all do our part. That idea lies at the very heart of this Organisation.

Likewise, the UN has a duty to strengthen its cooperation in protecting migrants, displaced persons, and those forced by political, social, economic, or environmental circumstances to seek lives elsewhere.

Our government is committed to transforming the relationship between the State of Guatemala and Guatemalans abroad—who are an integral part of our nation, and whose labour is essential to our economy. We are doing so through a strategy that ensures effective diaspora participation in national development, turning them into partners in efforts to improve living conditions for families remaining in Guatemala.

In the future we are building, migration is a right—an option—not a sentence imposed by lack of opportunity, violence, or hunger.

Over the past decade, Guatemala has evolved from being primarily a country of emigration to becoming one of transit and return—and, increasingly, a destination. Our commitment is to treat all individuals arriving on our territory with dignity—just as we demand for Guatemalans abroad. Our State is undertaking substantial changes in how it cares for and protects migrants. We have identified opportunities to strengthen the management of international migration flows in a safe, orderly, and regular manner.

It is my conviction—and that of my government and the overwhelming majority of Guatemalans—that all migrants deserve the chance to live with dignity and enjoy fundamental rights, regardless of the reasons that drive their migration.

That is why we strongly support the work carried out through the United Nations system. Guatemala actively promotes the 23 objectives set forth in the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, and we encourage international cooperation in this sphere.

With that same conviction, we welcomed 135 Nicaraguan brothers and sisters who had been arbitrarily imprisoned by their government. Our commitment is for Guatemala to remain a place of dignity and freedom for all who enter our territory—especially for our Central American brothers and sisters, whom our constitution, our history, and our collective spirit regard as compatriots.

Guatemala reaffirms its commitment to the fundamental principles of democracy, as enshrined in the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and as a foundational principle of our political life.

We reject—in our hemisphere and around the world—any attempt to suppress the peoples’ aspirations for freedom and justice, as expressed through free and democratic processes, as is currently the case in Venezuela and Nicaragua.

The principles of democracy are essential to preserving liberty, dignity, and inclusive, equitable prosperity for humanity.

**Mr President,**

Before this General Assembly, I reaffirm Guatemala’s commitment to resolve, once and for all, through the International Court of Justice, the territorial, insular, and maritime dispute with our neighbour and sister country, Belize. By choosing dialogue and international legal mechanisms, we have shown that peaceful means and respect for multilateral institutions are the most effective path to resolving disputes between nations. We trust that this process will lead to a just and definitive outcome—one that honours the rights and dignity of both countries. This act reflects our faith in international law and our commitment to lasting peace—not just for Guatemala and Belize, but as an example to the region and the world.

**Mr President,**

The urgency of the challenges we face demands that we take concrete action, rather than limit ourselves to rhetoric. Others have said it before me: the time to act is now.

Conflicts and migration in Central America are driven by what we consider the most urgent global challenge: the climate crisis. It threatens our systems, our economies, our food, and our very survival. We are at a critical juncture to safeguard both present and future generations.

Climate change is a devastating reality. It affects humanity today—and will have catastrophic consequences for the future. Although Guatemala is a megadiverse country, we are also highly vulnerable to extreme weather events that produce natural disasters, floods, landslides, wildfires, and rising temperatures—as we have all witnessed this year.

Our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is minimal, yet we are among the territories most affected by these extremes. We are adapting to this new reality and reducing our vulnerability. In 2025, we will submit our updated Nationally Determined Contribution, fulfilling our commitments under the Paris Agreement.

But we must remember in this forum that responsibility for this crisis is shared. It falls both on those who suffer its effects and on those who have caused them. We call urgently on the major powers to assume their rightful leadership—as well as their moral and financial responsibility toward the nations that have borne the worst consequences.

**The time to act is now.** It is essential that COP29 in Azerbaijan is a success. Guatemala’s commitment to this goal is unwavering.

**Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr President,**

Guatemala is changing—and that change entails a transformation of our relationship with the world. We are fulfilling our responsibility to contribute to the aims of this organisation. Our contribution stems from a normative commitment to peace and global solidarity, but also from a democratic mandate entrusted to us by the people. Our people believe that democracy is a prerequisite for progress and well-being.

Guatemala’s authoritarian past is still recent. It is a tragic past known to many of you. But our people’s deep-rooted desire for freedom, supported by the international community, has brought about a turn towards the promotion and defence of human rights. We are addressing our historical challenges with seriousness and accepting the responsibility to resolve today’s.

The recent visit of High Commissioner Volker Türk and the immediate renewal of his Office’s presence in Guatemala bear witness to that commitment.

Guatemala has renewed its pledge to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, and has recently adopted the Pact for the Future within the framework of the Summit of the Future. We are convinced that economic growth alone does not create development. Cooperation, environmental protection, social inclusion, respect and promotion of human dignity, and security are all indispensable preconditions for development.

Guatemala is changing. We are moving toward a fairer future, where development and progress reach every corner of the country—especially the most neglected communities—and where every person, regardless of origin, has the chance to build a full and dignified life.

This is the natural aspiration of all peoples. We will do our part to achieve it in Guatemala, and we will collaborate to realise it wherever needed. We do so because we know the world is changing. Whether this change—unavoidable and already underway—serves the well-being of our peoples and nations depends on our joint efforts in this forum.

That was the vision of those who founded this Organisation 79 years ago.  
It is the vision that must guide our actions today—as humanity.

In the spirit of the sacred book of the Mayan people, the *Popol Vuh*, I conclude by saying:

**Let all rise. Let no one be left behind.**

Thank you very much.
