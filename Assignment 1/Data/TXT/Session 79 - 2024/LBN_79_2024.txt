**Mr. António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations,  
Ambassador Dennis Francis, President of the General Assembly,  
Excellencies,**

First, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to you, Mr President, on your election as President of the seventy-ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I wish you success in your mission and affirm Lebanon’s full support for your programme, *"Unity in Diversity: Advancing Peace, Sustainable Development and Human Dignity."*

**Mr President,**

Lebanon is currently experiencing a crisis that threatens its very existence, the future of its people, and their well-being. This crisis requires immediate international intervention before matters spiral out of control, before the dominoes begin to fall, and before failure to contain the situation leads to a black hole that swallows both regional and international peace and security.

The escalating situation in Lebanon portends dire consequences for the entire Middle East if it is allowed to continue unchecked while the world looks on in silence.

**Mr President,**

We welcome the statement issued yesterday by the United States and France, supported by friendly nations, which offers an opportunity to establish long-term calm, ensure stability on the border, and enable the return of displaced persons to their homes. We call for all necessary measures to be taken to implement this statement.

What we are experiencing today in Lebanon is not the cause but the result of the absence of sustainable solutions. The real cause is occupation. Let us be clear: it is the occupation that causes all this suffering. As long as there is occupation, there will be instability and war.

We have made repeated attempts—through the United Nations—to resolve outstanding border issues with Israel, but Israel has evaded or ignored those efforts.

Despite the harsh circumstances we face, Lebanon remains committed to international legitimacy and seeks refuge in its resolutions. Lebanon was a co-author of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, through one of its distinguished sons, Charles Malik.

As much as we regret the United Nations’ failure to protect us from Israeli aggression, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the UN as a line of defence against occupation, brutality, violence, and destruction. Today, more than ever, the UN must serve as a sanctuary for small, peace-loving nations subjected to aggression—like my own country, Lebanon.

Even in the heart of tragedy, and despite our painful reality, we continue to seek constructive dialogue as an alternative to the language of arms to resolve conflicts. Lebanon has demonstrated its capacity to be a reliable partner in forging understandings—evident in the maritime boundary agreement with Israel in October 2022. That was clear proof of Lebanon’s commitment to resolving disputes through peaceful means.

We proposed—at two Security Council sessions, most recently on 17 July 2024—a comprehensive framework to establish sustainable calm along Lebanon’s southern border. Today, we repeat our call for a ceasefire on the fronts, which should serve as a starting point towards the full and unqualified implementation of **Security Council Resolution 1701**, which had successfully maintained relative stability in southern Lebanon from the end of the July 2006 war until 7 October 2023.

We also rely on the support of the international community and friendly states for the Lebanese government’s efforts to **enhance the deployment of the Lebanese Army south of the Litani River**. This includes providing the necessary equipment and assisting in increasing troop numbers, following the government’s decision to launch a new recruitment campaign—an unequivocal commitment to Resolution 1701.

There shall be **no weapons without the consent of the Lebanese government**, and **no authority outside that of the Lebanese government**, in line with the provisions of that resolution.

Our request for support reflects not only our commitment to fulfilling our obligations under 1701, but also our emphasis on the importance of international cooperation to address security challenges and strengthen peace and stability in the region.

We are all aware of the economic crisis that has struck the country. Despite this, the government has taken the significant decision to recruit 1,500 additional soldiers for deployment in southern Lebanon. This is not a trivial matter—it is a **political signal to the international community** that Lebanon is committed to and determined to implement Resolution 1701.

Even in the most difficult of times—as we are currently enduring—Lebanon does not stand idle. We are mobilising all our efforts, at the highest levels, to protect our people, our national institutions, and the sovereignty of our land.

**Mr President,**

One of the most important aspects of Resolution 1701 is the demarcation of Lebanon’s internationally recognised land borders with Palestine, as established in 1923 and reaffirmed by the 1949 Lebanon-Israel Armistice Agreement signed on the Greek island of Rhodes under UN supervision.

This must include completing the agreement on the thirteen disputed border points, with Israel withdrawing from all Lebanese areas it still occupies up to the internationally recognised borders.

We reaffirm the critical role of **UNIFIL**, the UN peacekeeping force operating in southern Lebanon. Since its establishment, UNIFIL has contributed to maintaining calm and stability in the region. Until 8 October 2023, there had been no incidents threatening regional peace and security. We thank UNIFIL for its considerable sacrifices and recognise the growing challenges it faces, especially in recent months and days.

**Mr President,**

On the other hand, instead of tiring of continuous wars and more than 75 years of fighting, Israel is **increasingly drawn to extremism**. Today, Lebanon’s most serious threat comes from escalating aggression, with the scope of war expanding deep into Lebanese territory.

We are also gravely concerned by the **systematic destruction of border villages**, the collective punishment of residents, and the **burning of agricultural lands with white phosphorus**, rendering them uninhabitable and unusable for years to come.

In recent days, we have witnessed a grotesque and horrifying example of how electronic devices designed for civilian use were converted into timed bombs, detonated deliberately and simultaneously. Dozens of people were killed—among them children and women—and thousands were injured, many of them seriously. Hundreds more suffered disfigurements, lost limbs, or were left blind.

From this very podium, we once again warn against escalating aggression, recklessness, and playing with fire. We reject attempts to drag the entire Middle East into a wider conflagration.

We reiterate our opposition to war and affirm **our legitimate right to self-defence**, in accordance with the UN Charter and international law. At the same time, we continue our tireless diplomatic efforts to avoid falling into the trap of **Israeli recklessness**, which seeks to prolong and expand the war.

**Mr President,**

The return of **displaced Israeli civilians** to their towns and settlements **will not be achieved through war, bombing, or the further displacement of Lebanese civilians**. The **shortest path to their return** lies in a **comprehensive and immediate ceasefire**, as called for in the US-French statement issued yesterday and supported by friendly nations.

The **full implementation of Resolution 1701**, as part of a comprehensive package with **clear, public, and transparent international guarantees**, must be accompanied by a **permanent end to Israeli violations**—on land, at sea, and in the air—of Lebanon’s internationally recognised sovereignty and borders, which have been breached **more than 35,000 times** since 2006.

**Mr President,**

Has Israel not had enough of continuous wars since 1948?  
When will it give peace a real chance?  
Does it not wish to try the path of peace—just once—to the very end, instead of the path of iron, fire, blood, and destruction?

Lebanon and the Arab states have clearly and unambiguously chosen peace, through the **Arab Peace Initiative** issued at the **2002 Beirut Summit**, accepting the two-state solution and calling for the implementation of United Nations resolutions—resolutions that have, regrettably, remained ink on paper.

It is now time for Israel—government and people—to genuinely choose peace over war, and to overcome its security obsessions. **Breaking the cycle of violence** in the region and preventing the total explosion of the Middle East requires **collective action** within a defined timeframe, supported by **clear guarantees** recognising legitimate rights—first and foremost, the **right to self-determination**, in accordance with relevant international resolutions.

**There will be no peace without the two-state solution, no matter how long it takes.**

**Mr President,**

In conclusion, we renew our call for a **sustainable solution**, through the **full and balanced implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701** and the demarcation of Lebanon’s internationally recognised land borders. This is the only way to prevent further wars and destruction for Lebanon and the region.

We are passing through an extremely difficult period, marked by a tragic escalation of violence in Lebanon. From the heart of this conflict, **Resolution 1701 represents the first line of defence for Lebanon**. It is not just a document or framework—it is a commitment by the international community to uphold regional peace and stability.

We cannot deviate from this path, for it is the **legal and diplomatic foundation** that guarantees the protection of Lebanon’s and the region’s security. **Compliance with Resolution 1701 is essential not only for Lebanon, but also for Israel and the entire region.** It remains the most effective tool available to the international community to break the cycle of violence and allow diplomacy to prevail—no matter how difficult that path may be.

The cost of diplomatic failure is extremely high. We must not forget that **every round of violence brings unimaginable suffering**, especially for civilians. **The killing of any civilian is a tragedy that cannot be justified.** When civilian areas are systematically targeted—as is currently happening—we are talking about acts that amount to **war crimes**. Nothing can justify the indiscriminate killing of innocents.

While we speak of death and destruction, **we must also focus on finding solutions**. Time is running out, and it is imperative that we find a **political path out of this deepening crisis**. The only way forward is a political solution. We must think together about how to exit this crisis politically, rather than sinking further into militarisation and prolonged conflict.

**Diplomacy is not always easy—but it is the only way to save lives, innocent people, and nations.**  
**Lebanon is determined to walk this path.**

We see in the **US-French initiative**, supported by other friendly countries, an opportunity to pause and open a small window in this crisis—one that we hope Israel will seize.

**Diplomacy must succeed. There is no other option.**

**Thank you.**
