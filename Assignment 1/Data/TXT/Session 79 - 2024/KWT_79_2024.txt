**Mr President,**

I extend to you my congratulations, and to your friendly country, on your election as President of the seventy-ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are confident that your broad experience in international affairs will enable you to lead its work with wisdom and competence. Your chosen theme—**“Unity in Diversity: for Peace, Sustainable Development, and Human Dignity for All”**—is of immense importance and pressing urgency in today's world.

I also wish to express my appreciation for the efforts of your predecessor, Mr. Dennis Francis, during his presidency of the seventy-eighth session, and I commend the wise leadership and tireless efforts of the Secretary-General of this esteemed organisation. His work in navigating rapid international developments has embodied the noble mission of the United Nations, grounded in the preservation of international peace and security, the promotion of justice, and the dignity and rights of humanity.

**Mr President,**

Maintaining the effectiveness and credibility of this organisation is a shared responsibility of Member States and the international community. We must face challenges with genuine political will and decisive action. In recent days, the **Summit of the Future** has offered a critical moment to examine the present state of the world and highlight the grave challenges that require innovative solutions and serious reform. Chief among these are the reform of the **Security Council** and the **international financial institutions**.

History is filled with pivotal global milestones, and we hope this summit becomes one such moment, investing in momentum that has been carefully laid by the Secretary-General. We look forward to continuing our joint efforts to achieve multilateral goals.

The Crown Prince emphasised that cooperation and partnership are the only path to overcoming shared challenges. No country is exempt from these crises, and none can confront them in isolation.

**Mr President,**

Renewing international solidarity demands a sincere and collective political will to advance reform, particularly of the Security Council. It also requires adapting the international system to respond effectively to evolving global threats to peace and stability. Unfortunately, we have yet to see clear evidence of such a political will being translated into trust-building and effective action.

As the primary body responsible for maintaining international peace and security, the Security Council must uphold democratic principles in its decision-making and ensure fair representation of all Member States. Reform is necessary to reflect the world as it is today—not the geopolitical order of 1945—and to establish a Council that is more inclusive, responsive, and accountable.

**Mr President,**

The accelerating pace of technological innovation, including the use of **artificial intelligence** and **social media** to incite hate speech, promote extremism, and spread disinformation, now poses a serious threat to global cybersecurity. These dangers must be addressed with urgency. The harmful use of such tools affects people of all ages—especially young people—and confirms that combating these challenges requires international cooperation.

As we strive to protect the interests and future of our peoples, there can be no genuine and lasting progress unless accountability is upheld for those who violate the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law and human rights. There can be no justice or equality under double standards, and no sustainable future if such practices go unchecked.

**Mr President,**

This year marks the **43rd anniversary** of the establishment of the **Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)**, which has proven over four decades to be a cornerstone for stability and prosperity in our region. In this context, I express Kuwait’s deep appreciation to the **Sultanate of Oman** for its sincere efforts during its current presidency of the GCC Council, contributing meaningfully to progress on both bilateral and multilateral levels.

Kuwait is preparing to assume the presidency of the GCC Supreme Council in December. We reaffirm our determination to advance this blessed journey and to enhance strategic partnerships with international organisations in pursuit of the Council’s noble objectives. The GCC will remain—God willing—a voice of wisdom, moderation, and constructive dialogue amid rapid challenges and transformations.

Kuwait also looks forward to the regional and international events hosted by GCC states. In particular, we congratulate the **Kingdom of Saudi Arabia** on its successful bids to host **Expo 2030** and the **FIFA World Cup 2034**, and we affirm Kuwait’s full readiness to support these efforts and ensure their success.

**Mr President,**

From its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness, **the State of Kuwait** has, for decades, continuously and sincerely worked to support the **Republic of Iraq** in its efforts to restore its sovereignty and regain its regional and international standing. This has been achieved through ongoing and constructive cooperation that respects Iraq’s unity and stability.

In this spirit, **Kuwait calls on Iraq** to urgently take tangible and decisive steps to resolve all outstanding bilateral issues, foremost among them the **demarcation of maritime boundaries beyond point 162**, in accordance with international law and relevant international agreements. We also stress the importance of completing the **repatriation of Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons**, as well as the **return of Kuwaiti properties**, including the **Kuwaiti National Archives**, under United Nations and Security Council supervision.

We further urge the Iraqi authorities to **honour bilateral agreements** related to maritime navigation and security in **Khor Abdullah**, agreements that reinforce environmental protection, maritime safety, and the fight against terrorism and the illicit trafficking of arms and drugs. We affirm the importance of continued **dialogue** and sustained diplomatic engagement, based on mutual respect and a shared desire to build stable and prosperous bilateral relations.

**Mr President,**

The **world is witnessing an alarming rise** in military operations by the Israeli occupying forces against the **Palestinian people**, particularly in the **Gaza Strip** and the **occupied Palestinian territories**, including **Jerusalem and the West Bank**. These include indiscriminate airstrikes, collective punishment, and the systematic targeting of civilians, resulting in the deaths of over **41,000 innocent people**, many of them children, women, and the elderly.

The continuation of this occupation and its widespread violations—such as the destruction of infrastructure and international institutions, the displacement of populations, and the denial of basic services—require immediate international attention.

There will be **no peace in the Middle East** without the establishment of an **independent and fully sovereign State of Palestine**, with **East Jerusalem as its capital**, along the **1967 borders**, in accordance with **international resolutions** and the **Arab Peace Initiative**.

In this context, Kuwait welcomes the recognition of the State of Palestine by several countries and calls on other nations to take similar steps. Kuwait remains firmly committed to supporting the Palestinian cause and has recently submitted a **legal memorandum to the International Court of Justice**, highlighting the legal consequences of the continued occupation of Palestinian territories.

We also acknowledge the important role of the **Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan**, the **Republic of Slovenia**, and **more than 120 Member States** of the United Nations, who have endorsed the **“Joint Commitments” declaration** in support of **UNRWA**. This agency must continue to function as a cornerstone of humanitarian support, especially amid the absence of serious international efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace.

**Mr President,**

The tragic conflict in **Sudan** resulting from the ongoing armed confrontations is a source of profound concern. Kuwait calls for an **immediate cessation of hostilities**, a return to **dialogue**, and a **peaceful political process** that preserves Sudan’s unity, stability, and sovereignty. We support all regional and international initiatives aimed at achieving a political resolution, protecting civilians, and facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid, while respecting Sudan’s national sovereignty.

Regarding the situation in **Yemen**, Kuwait reaffirms its support for the efforts of the **United Nations Special Envoy to Yemen**, aimed at reviving the political process and reaching a **comprehensive settlement** in accordance with the **agreed-upon references**: the **Gulf Initiative**, the **National Dialogue Outcomes**, and **UN Security Council Resolution 2216**. We also support the constructive efforts made by **the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia** and **the Sultanate of Oman** to achieve a sustainable political solution in Yemen.

Kuwait expresses its concern about recent **hostile operations** in the **Red Sea** and stresses the importance of **protecting maritime navigation**, in line with international law and the **1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea**.

On the situation in **Syria**, Kuwait reaffirms the need to intensify efforts to reach a **political solution** that reflects the aspirations of the Syrian people. This must be a Syrian-owned process, in accordance with **Security Council Resolution 2254**, aimed at ensuring Syria’s **security, stability, unity**, and **territorial integrity**.

Regarding the **Republic of Lebanon**, Kuwait strongly condemns the Israeli airstrikes and military actions against Lebanon, which have resulted in the deaths of many civilians. We reject these violations, which are part of a dangerous and continuous escalation, in clear violation of **international law** and **international humanitarian law**. Kuwait has long warned of the implications of such aggression, particularly for neighbouring countries and regional peace.

We also express our deep concern regarding Israel’s violations of **Lebanon’s sovereignty** and its attempts to drag the entire region into a wider conflict. Kuwait stresses the **importance of fully implementing Security Council Resolution 1701**, and we reaffirm our support for Lebanon’s stability, sovereignty, and right to self-determination.

**Mr President,**

We follow with concern the recent developments in the **State of Libya**, and we call for the primacy of **wisdom and national unity**, and a return to **inclusive political dialogue** as the only path to resolve differences. Such a resolution must be based on the relevant **United Nations Security Council resolutions**, and must safeguard Libya’s **sovereignty**, **stability**, and **territorial integrity**, while enabling the Libyan people to restore peace and prosperity.

At the **regional level**, and in accordance with the principles of **good neighbourliness** enshrined in the **Charter of the United Nations**, the State of Kuwait renews its call to the **Islamic Republic of Iran** to take **serious measures to build confidence** and **engage in direct dialogue**, based on mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of other states.

**Mr President,**

The **State of Kuwait** has adopted **"Kuwait Vision 2035"**, a strategic national plan aimed at achieving sustainable development. The Vision reflects Kuwait’s strong commitment to active participation in the global economy, including financial and economic summits and forums, and anticipates associated developments and challenges.

This forward-looking plan aims to **transform Kuwait into a regional financial, commercial, and cultural hub**, and it aligns with the evolving international landscape. To achieve this, **foreign policy** will play a dynamic role, complementing economic diversification through a modern, proactive, and adaptable diplomacy that moves beyond traditional diplomacy towards a model based on **active engagement and leadership**, drawing inspiration from our nation’s **cultural and humanitarian heritage**.

---

**In conclusion**,  
I reiterate the **State of Kuwait’s firm commitment** to **multilateralism**, to the **principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations**, and to strengthening **global governance** in service of **international peace and security** and the well-being of all humanity.

In this regard, I affirm Kuwait’s readiness to cooperate with all **friendly and brotherly nations** in pursuit of our shared aspirations for a world where **peace, security, and prosperity** prevail.

**Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.**
