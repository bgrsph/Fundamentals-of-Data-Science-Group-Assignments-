Mr. Philemon Yang, President of the General Assembly,  
Mr. Secretary-General, António Guterres,  
Excellencies, Heads of State and Government,  
Honourable Delegates,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is with great honour that I address this esteemed Assembly, representing São Tomé and Príncipe, a small island state which, like so many others, is confronted with the complex challenges of our time.

On behalf of the people of São Tomé and Príncipe, I would first like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your brilliant election as President of the 79th Session of the General Assembly.

Allow me also to warmly congratulate Secretary-General António Guterres for the excellent work he is doing to promote international dialogue and cooperation for peace and development.

**Excellencies,**

It is easy for me, as for anyone present in this chamber, to affirm that what emerges from today’s global issues is a prevailing sense of uncertainty and insecurity affecting both the present and the future.

As a small island state, my country is on the front line of the consequences of climate change, which represents the greatest existential threat to our populations. Although we contribute only a minuscule share of global greenhouse gas emissions, we are among those who suffer the most from their effects. Rising sea levels, more frequent and intense storms, coastal erosion, and biodiversity loss threaten not only our livelihoods but our very existence.

It is therefore imperative that the international community strengthens its commitments to the Paris Agreement and ensures that the voices of the most affected nations, like ours, are heard and integrated into concrete actions. We call for global action that is not only ambitious but also urgent.

The upcoming COP29 on Climate Change, to be held in November in Baku (Azerbaijan), will be a crucial opportunity to reaffirm our collective commitment to limit global warming to 1.5°C. However, commitments alone are not enough. We need concrete and immediate action to mitigate the impacts of the climate crisis. We urge the largest emitters to fulfil their historical and moral obligations by drastically reducing their emissions and honouring the climate finance commitments made to developing countries, who are bearing the brunt of a crisis they did not cause.

We also call for the expansion of financing mechanisms for adaptation, for we must strengthen our resilience.

We are already investing in innovative adaptation solutions, such as the sustainable use of our marine resources and the implementation of renewable energies. However, our efforts must be intensified, and this requires support from the international community.

**Excellencies,**

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) continue to guide our progress. For us, sustainable development is not a choice but a necessity. Our vision for the future is based on the SDGs, and we strive to strike a balance between economic growth, environmental protection, and social justice. Yet the deadline to achieve them is fast approaching, and for many of us, the road ahead remains long. Development support must be renewed, and new models of partnership between nations must be explored. We reaffirm our commitment to the SDGs, but without an international environment that promotes fair trade, access to finance, and peace, our efforts will be constrained.

We call on the international community to support our transition to a green economy, so that together we can become examples of how sustainable development can transform societies and ensure prosperity for future generations.

At the same time, we must not overlook the importance of strengthening multilateral institutions and ensuring that all states—regardless of size or economic power—have a voice in decisions taken at the global level. Multilateralism is our best tool to address the collective challenges that transcend borders.

**Ladies and Gentlemen,**

Global peace and security are increasingly under threat, from armed conflict to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The African continent continues to be the stage for prolonged conflicts, causing profound and unacceptable suffering. These conflicts underscore the need for greater diplomatic intervention and African solutions to African problems.

São Tomé and Príncipe urges the international community to intensify its mediation efforts and support for the peaceful resolution of conflicts in Africa, while respecting national sovereignty. There can be no development without peace, and peace is only possible with justice.

**Excellencies,**

I also take this opportunity to echo a call that has resonated in this Assembly for decades: the need to end the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed on the Republic of Cuba. This blockade is unjust, outdated, and contrary to the principles of peaceful coexistence and solidarity among nations. The Cuban people have shown great resilience, but it is time for the international community, and particularly the United Nations, to step up efforts to correct this injustice, in the name of peace and human dignity.

**Excellencies,**

This year marks the 79th anniversary of the United Nations. This longevity grants the UN a unique status.

Indeed, such an observation cannot be dismissed lightly.

It represents nearly eight decades of hard work and experience, unmatched by any other organisation, in the pursuit of peace and the provision of global public goods.

On this occasion, we must commend the steadfast commitment of the Secretary-General, whose work on all fronts deeply touches us.

Faced with our persistent dilemmas, it is imperative to bring renewed hope to the global stage. This is an essential goal and role for the United Nations, but it is also our shared mission.

The current state of the world is not a foregone conclusion.

If we strip the United Nations of its substance, and each state retreats into a mindset of “every man for himself,” then global problems—such as war, economic crises, environmental degradation and other ills—will remain unresolved.

The world has changed since the founding of this organisation. The international system, like its institutions, must evolve to reflect present realities and needs. We support a reform of the United Nations Security Council so that it may be more representative and more effective in fulfilling its mission of maintaining global peace and security. The multipolar world in which we live today demands a more inclusive and dynamic UN. In saying this, I emphasise the necessity of considering Africa as part of the whole. We cannot continue with a Security Council that reflects the power structures of 1945—a time when most present-day African states were still under colonial rule and had no say in international affairs. This underrepresentation of the continent is also evident in other global governance structures, such as international financial institutions, and it is urgent that this be addressed.

**Ladies and Gentlemen,**

The future we want must be built on the foundations of cooperation, solidarity, and mutual understanding. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the interdependence of nations and the need to craft common responses to global challenges. We must continue to strengthen multilateralism and promote the sharing of knowledge, resources, and innovative solutions.

São Tomé and Príncipe reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the principles that govern this Organisation. We are convinced that through dialogue and cooperation, we will be able to address the greatest challenges of our time—from climate change to poverty, and including the promotion of human rights and equity.

**Excellencies,**

In conclusion, we would like to reaffirm that our presence here is a testament to our faith in the United Nations and its ideals. Despite our limited resources, we bring to the global table our unwavering determination to contribute to a fairer, safer, and more sustainable world. São Tomé and Príncipe stands ready to play its part and to continue working hand in hand with all nations present to build a better future for all.

**I thank you for your attention.**
