Mr President of the General Assembly,  
Excellencies, Heads of State and Delegation,  
Mr Secretary-General of the United Nations,  
Distinguished guests,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

1. First and foremost, on behalf of the President of the Republic of Chad, my delegation, and in my own name, I wish to extend my warmest congratulations to Mr Philemon Yang for his brilliant election as President of the 79th Session of the General Assembly. I wish him every success in his mission and assure him of Chad's full support throughout his term.

2. I also wish to express our sincere gratitude and warmest congratulations to Mr Dennis Francis, outgoing President of the General Assembly, for the excellent work accomplished during his mandate.

3. I would also like to express my high appreciation and full support for Mr António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his leadership and commitment to a renewed United Nations Organisation capable of meeting the aspirations of the world’s peoples.

Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

4. The theme of this session—*“Unity in diversity for peace, sustainable development, and dignity for all everywhere”*—resonates deeply with the aspirations and challenges we face in Chad, in Africa, and around the world.

5. The promotion of peace, sustainable development, and human dignity must not remain a slogan or rhetorical exercise. This session should inspire us to act with determination and compassion to build together a just and peaceful world where every individual and every community can thrive in dignity.

6. In Chad, as in many Sahelian countries, peace remains a crucial issue. Despite facing many challenges, it is essential to acknowledge the efforts our states have made in the fight against terrorist groups—whose origins and sources of funding remain unclear—groups that threaten our institutions, hinder our development efforts, and worsen the suffering of our people. The international community’s lack of real will to eradicate the scourge of terrorism in the Sahel could result in the entire African continent falling under the grip of terrorist groups.

7. We are convinced that a strong commitment from the international community is necessary to meet this challenge. Together, we must win this fight against terrorism by strengthening our cooperation to promote stability on our continent—and, by extension, the shared destiny of humanity.

Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

8. By 2030, we will collectively assess progress on the United Nations' sustainable development agenda. Chad, like many African countries, finds itself at a crossroads of multiple challenges, particularly climate change, which threatens our food security.

9. Prolonged droughts, desertification, and unpredictable floods are undermining our economies and affecting vulnerable populations. We therefore call on the international community to honour its commitments on climate finance and justice, as well as the transfer of green technologies.

10. Under the leadership of President Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno—democratically elected on the basis of a structured and ambitious political programme, which I have the honour of representing at this 79th session—Chad is working tirelessly to improve access to education, clean water, energy, healthcare, and economic opportunities.

11. We must combat poverty and inequalities, particularly gender-based inequalities, by building a renewed global partnership that recognises the specific needs of Least Developed Countries and commits to full inclusion.

12. We call for equitable access to vaccines and cutting-edge medical technologies, as health and education are the foundations of human dignity.

13. We are also determined to promote social inclusion, the empowerment of women and youth, and the protection of human rights. In this regard, the support of the international community is crucial.

Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

14. The future we shape today will determine the world we leave for future generations.

15. In Chad, our youth—who represent more than 65% of the population—is our greatest wealth. We are investing in their education and political participation to prevent their manipulation by radical and violent extremist groups.

16. Furthermore, we call on the United Nations to support an open labour market and to ensure an environment conducive to youth development.

17. The emigration of African youth stems from the deep divide separating our countries, despite our shared destiny.

Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

18. In terms of domestic policy, we are proud of our political transition, culminating in free, democratic, and transparent elections that led to the election of President Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno to the highest office in our country on 6 May, for a five-year term.

19. This milestone demonstrates our commitment to peaceful, democratic, and inclusive governance, thereby strengthening our democracy.

Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

20. Climate change also represents a major global challenge, with devastating consequences in vulnerable regions such as the Sahel.

21. Recent floods in Chad, affecting more than 1.5 million people, are a stark reminder of this reality.

22. In the face of this emergency, we appeal for international solidarity to help us respond.

23. Simultaneously, Chad hosts more than two million refugees—around 15% of our population. This situation places a heavy burden on our resources and exacerbates the humanitarian emergency.

24. This figure is largely due to a massive influx of Sudanese refugees, resulting from the crisis in their country, in addition to hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighbouring states.

25. We call for strengthened international solidarity to support both the refugees and the host communities.

Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

26. The continuation of hostilities in Sudan prolongs the suffering of Sudanese civilians and worsens the humanitarian situation in combat zones and in neighbouring countries such as Chad, which continues to receive new refugees every day.

27. Chad regrets that repeated calls for a ceasefire have gone unheeded by the warring parties. My country is deeply concerned about the continued fighting in Sudan, which is further deteriorating the humanitarian situation and impacting neighbouring countries, including Chad.

28. Chad reiterates its urgent appeal to the parties in conflict to immediately cease hostilities, to allow unhindered humanitarian access to the millions of victims of this fratricidal war, and to resume political dialogue.

29. Chad remains convinced that the current crisis in Sudan cannot be resolved through arms, but through peaceful means—through an intra-Sudanese dialogue aimed at achieving lasting peace.

30. Chad reaffirms its support for all ongoing initiatives aimed at restoring peace and stability in Sudan.

31. Regarding the Libyan crisis, we call on all parties to show restraint and resolve the political deadlock afflicting the country.

Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

32. Conflicts are not limited to Africa.

33. The situation in Ukraine, as well as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, highlights the dangers of unjustified violence that claims so many innocent lives against a backdrop of intensifying geopolitical tensions.

34. Regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we strongly condemn the violence and atrocities committed against innocent civilians, and we reaffirm our support for a two-state solution and the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, while calling for a peaceful and negotiated resolution of the conflict.

35. The world cannot remain indifferent or sleep peacefully in the face of the unbearable images coming from Gaza and other Palestinian areas.

36. Likewise, we cannot ignore the embargo on Cuba, which harms its people and hinders its development.

37. Chad calls for the lifting of this embargo and the promotion of constructive dialogue.

Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

38. I reaffirm Chad’s support for the African Common Position on the reform of the Security Council, as set out in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. I call upon the sense of justice and solidarity of all nations to accelerate this long-awaited and much-needed reform.

39. Africa seeks nothing more than redress for a blatant injustice committed against an entire continent—home to more than a billion souls—unjustly denied its legitimate place in global governance.

Mr President of the General Assembly,  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

40. The path toward a future of peace, sustainable development, and human dignity is strewn with obstacles, but it is our collective responsibility to chart that path.

41. In conclusion, Chad reaffirms its adherence to the ideals and founding principles of the United Nations Charter and calls on the international community to strengthen multilateralism in order to build a peaceful, more just, equitable, and united world.

**Thank you for your kind attention.**
