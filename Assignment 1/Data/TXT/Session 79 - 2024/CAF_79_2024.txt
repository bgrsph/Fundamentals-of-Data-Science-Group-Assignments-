Mr President of the General Assembly,  
Excellencies, Heads of State and Government,  
Distinguished Delegates,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is with renewed honour that I speak before this global gathering on behalf of the Central African Republic—my beloved country—to contribute to the General Debate on the theme of the 79th Session of the UN General Assembly.

By participating in this General Assembly, the Central African Republic reaffirms its commitment to the shared pursuit of trust, peace, security, international solidarity, and mutual understanding—indispensable to rebuilding a peaceful world conducive to sustainable development and the respect for human dignity, both now and for generations to come.

Before I proceed further, I would like to warmly congratulate His Excellency Philémon Yang on his historic election as President of this 79th Session.  
Your election is a tribute not only to your person but also to our continent—Africa—and a source of pride and inspiration for the 51 million citizens of the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC), for which I currently hold the rotating chairmanship of the Conference of Heads of State. This is especially meaningful for our sister republic, Cameroon—your beautiful country.

Your deep knowledge of international affairs and your personal qualities are assets that give us confidence in the success of our work.

I am convinced you will serve the interests of the United Nations and all its Member States and implement the broad UN reform agenda to make the Organisation more effective, inclusive, representative, and adapted to today’s world and the urgent problems confronting humanity.

You can count on the full support of the Central African Republic in this regard.

I also wish to commend the excellent work and achievements of President Dennis Francis during the 78th Session. He has the sincere appreciation of the Central African people.

To the UN Secretary-General, His Excellency António Guterres, I would like to reiterate the Central African Republic’s gratitude and full support for his various initiatives to make the UN a true space for global cooperation and harmonisation of national efforts.

As you know, on 30 July this year, the UN Security Council lifted the unjust and illegitimate arms embargo imposed on the Central African Armed Forces—an embargo that, for over a decade, caused the country irreparable harm. From this podium, I express the Central African people’s gratitude for this wise, albeit delayed, decision, which now allows us to continue working towards peace and security and to participate in global efforts for peace, sustainable development, and human dignity.

To all of you who have kept the Central African Republic close to your hearts and supported this just cause, I extend our people’s profound gratitude.

As a country with substantial mineral wealth, the Central African Republic hopes to receive continued support for lifting the Kimberley Process embargo on diamonds, which still limits our action for peace, sustainable development, and dignity.

Mr President,  
The theme of this session—*“Leave no one behind: joint action for peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations”*—contains vital recommendations that will heavily influence discussions on reforming global peace and security architecture and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We know peace and sustainable development are inseparable.

Yet even as we meet annually in this grand assembly or at equally important forums, the world remains beset by existential threats, growing instability, and vulnerability. This 79th Session unfolds against a backdrop of worsening geopolitical crises: the wars in Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan, and eastern DRC; the scourge of terrorism; economic deterioration stifling Africa’s growth; and soaring fuel prices.

The Central African Republic, convinced that dialogue is the only path to lasting peace, urges all parties to the world's conflicts to prioritise diplomacy and negotiation—to resolve the root causes of these conflicts and spare countless human lives.

In 2024, the security situation in the Central African Republic has remained relatively stable. The country is preparing to reinforce democratic foundations through upcoming municipal and regional elections—unprecedented in over 40 years.

To this end, special measures are being implemented to neutralise residual armed groups, who, unable to control territory, engage in organised crime, illegal mining, and trafficking of natural resources to acquire arms.

The 10th Strategic DDRR Committee meeting and recent celebration of Amnesty Month in Bangui, organised by the African Union Peace and Security Council, have underscored the significant progress achieved through national ownership and inclusive participation in the broader peace and security process—anchored in the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation and the Luanda Joint Roadmap.

Despite progress, we face challenges: building military barracks in high-threat areas and acquiring equipment for defence and security forces.

Mr President,  
Climate change—with its deadly floods, droughts, and wildfires—is fuelling food and water insecurity, competition for natural resources, loss of livelihoods, and mass displacement. These cascading and interlinked risks have profound implications for peace, security, and development.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the epicentre of humanitarian crises, environmental disasters this year alone have caused over 1,000 deaths, displaced 4 million climate refugees, and inflicted devastating material losses. Our neighbour Chad has suffered heavily, with widespread flooding following days of torrential rain and mass evacuations.

From this UN podium—the ultimate symbol of human solidarity—I express the Central African people’s support for all those around the world affected by natural disasters.

In this world ravaged by bloody conflicts and deadly weather events, only developing countries—made poor by centuries of slavery, colonialism, and neocolonial interference—must helplessly face security, financial, economic, food, and environmental crises.

Pledges of climate finance remain unfulfilled. Mitigation measures adopted at successive COPs are inconsistent, swayed by the political and strategic interests of major powers.

Aware of climate dangers, my country has adopted sectoral policies—whose effectiveness depends in part on still-unreliable climate funding.

The Central African Republic urges the UN to advance the Climate–Peace–Development Nexus by linking climate adaptation with peacebuilding. This would help holistically address vulnerabilities related to climate change, fragility, and conflict.

Mr President,  
The world edges dangerously toward the abyss. The UN’s current peace and security architecture is under immense pressure. Africa’s demands for Security Council reform and veto rights are compelling.

A step forward came when the United States voiced support for two permanent African seats on the Security Council and one rotating seat for small island developing states. While commendable, this proposal falls short of what is due. Africa—long sidelined—must not accept a perpetual denial of veto power.

Likewise, the reform of global financial governance must accelerate—to reduce inequality, mobilise adequate SDG financing, meet the needs of developing countries, and improve implementation of multilateral environmental agreements, realising our shared goal of planetary protection.

Mr President,  
By 2050, demographers estimate that half of the world’s youth will live in Africa, with half of its 54 countries having doubled their populations.

I welcome the *Pact for the Future* and its accompanying Global Digital Compact and Declarations on Future Generations, adopted at the Summit of the Future.

It is time to accelerate SDG implementation in science, technology, innovation, and digital cooperation—focusing on equity, rights, and universality.

Today’s youth—essential agents of change and key to development, rights, peace, and security—still face vulnerabilities that prevent them from realising their full potential and enjoying their rights.

We must therefore commit to increasing investment in youth, women, girls, and persons with disabilities, to secure a better future for all.

In the Central African Republic, the ambitious 2024–2028 National Development Plan seeks to better balance the needs and interests of present and future generations, with a strategic focus on human capital development.

In conclusion, I hope that the spirit which led to the UN’s creation continues to guide us—so that together we may resolve threats to peace, security, and sustainable development for the good of all humankind.

**Thank you.**
