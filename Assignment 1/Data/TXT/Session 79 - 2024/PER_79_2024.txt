Mr President of the United Nations General Assembly,  
Distinguished delegates of the nations of the world,

1. I have the privilege of addressing this General Assembly, bringing the special and respectful greetings of the Constitutional President of the Republic, Dr Dina Boluarte Zegarra, who would have wished to be here and speak before this great universal Assembly.

2. I am honoured to convey the voice of my fellow Peruvians—women and men who, through their daily efforts, aspire to a life of dignity and to leaving behind a promising future for their children.

3. Like the rest of the world, Peru has strived tirelessly to mitigate the harmful effects of political instability and the economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which exacted a severe cost on Peruvian society, especially its most vulnerable sectors.

4. That is why President Boluarte’s government is working tirelessly to restore economic growth, unlock stalled projects, and attract foreign investment for the development of major infrastructure works capable of generating decent and high-quality employment, thereby directly contributing to national development. Today, we can already see the first results of these efforts, and Peru is back on the path of growth and stability.

5. We still have a long road ahead. Peru and all countries face a series of shared challenges that we can only overcome through international cooperation and harmonised efforts. That is why Peru reiterates its commitment to **multilateralism**, which remains the best tool we have to collectively create the conditions necessary to achieve sustainable development.

**[INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY]**

6. The first of these conditions is **peace**.

7. The nations that founded this organisation after the Second World War did so to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.” The current reality shows that we are failing in this fundamental purpose.

8. Peru **condemns any use of force in international relations**. Aggression and the acquisition of territory by force are contrary to the UN Charter and international law. They also undermine the legitimacy and effectiveness of our collective security system.

9. The paralysis of the **Security Council** in some conflicts and the application of **biases and double standards** in others remind us of the urgent need to **reform the Council** and reconsider the prerogatives of its Permanent Members, particularly the **veto power**, which is sometimes used for political motives rather than humanitarian concerns.

Mr President,

10. From this General Assembly, Peru will continue taking **concrete actions in favour of peace**. We will keep supporting arms control regimes, disarmament initiatives, and nuclear non-proliferation. We remain committed to the **total elimination of nuclear weapons**, and we reject any testing, use, or threat of their use. While we hope for a verifiable international disarmament process, we urge nuclear-armed states to **resume bilateral commitments**, such as the **New START Treaty**.

11. On the ground, Peru will continue contributing to **UN peacekeeping operations**, as we have done since 1958, with over 10,000 personnel having served. Currently, more than 250 members of our **Armed Forces and National Police** are deployed under the UN flag, serving with professionalism, courage, and dedication. We have also made available a **Rapid Reaction Force** of 200 troops ready for immediate deployment wherever and whenever required by the UN.

12. Peru recognises the critical role of **women in the peace and security agenda**. We are pleased to report that we have **surpassed the targets** set by the UN's 2018–2028 Gender Parity Strategy for uniformed personnel and will continue increasing the percentage of Peruvian women deployed in peacekeeping missions.

**[ENVIRONMENT AND DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT]**

Mr President,

13. The second condition for development is a **clean and healthy environment**.

14. Climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution are **interconnected threats** that endanger the survival of current and future generations.

15. Peru’s high vulnerability to the effects of climate change makes it a **top priority** of our foreign policy. Alongside other countries, we have **requested an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice** on states’ international obligations regarding climate change.

16. Last year, Peru was struck by **Cyclone Yaku** and the **El Niño phenomenon**, which caused loss of life and severe material damage. I express our gratitude to the **United Nations system** for supporting our government's response.

17. Aware of the growing frequency and severity of these phenomena due to climate change, my government has adopted a **preventive approach** to disaster risk management, aligned with the Secretary-General’s **“Early Warnings for All”** initiative and the **Sendai Framework**.

18. We are also updating our **National Climate Change Strategy** to achieve **carbon neutrality by 2050**, and we are promoting a shift to a **low-carbon economy** based on **clean and renewable energy**.

19. However, these national efforts are **not enough**. We must increase **international cooperation** while adhering to the principle of **common but differentiated responsibilities** in climate action.

20. Developed countries must adopt **more ambitious emission reduction targets** and fulfil their **climate finance commitments**, including the mobilisation of at least **$100 billion annually** for developing countries and implementation of the **loss and damage fund** agreed at **COP27**. It is also urgent to ensure funding for the **Green Climate Fund (GCF)**, which has supported our adaptation and mitigation efforts.

**[SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND INCLUSION]**

Mr President,

21. Our **main challenge** is to ensure **development** for our people. We have the **2030 Agenda** and **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** to guide us. Unfortunately, the latest UN report shows we are **off track**.

22. Peru is committed to the 2030 Agenda. We have increased by **over 10%** the resources allocated to SDG implementation. I highlight our progress in **three priority areas**: health, education, and social protection.

**[HEALTH]**

23. Faced with **Latin America’s worst dengue outbreak**, Peru took swift action, halving the lethality rate compared to the previous epidemic. We are updating our **prevention and control strategies** in line with WHO guidelines.

**[EDUCATION]**

24. To provide **quality education**, we are prioritising **teacher training** and strengthening **technical education** at secondary and tertiary levels to improve youth employment. We have launched an **ambitious investment programme** to close infrastructure gaps.

**[SOCIAL PROTECTION]**

25. The third priority is **social protection for development**.

26. We have **increased funding** for the **Food Assistance Programme**, which supports vulnerable groups through community kitchens and shelters, coordinated with local governments, the private sector, and civil society. We are also boosting **agricultural productivity and sustainability**, especially through **family farming**.

27. Peru runs **numerous social programmes** to combat poverty and social exclusion, alongside **public policies** for **women’s and girls’ empowerment** and protection from **gender-based violence**, including economic autonomy initiatives.

28. Our social protection framework includes the fight against **discrimination and racism**, and guarantees the **collective rights of Indigenous peoples and Afro-Peruvians**, as well as the delivery of services with an **intercultural approach**—in recognition of Peru’s **multicultural, multi-ethnic, and multilingual identity**.

---

**[FINANCING FOR DEVELOPMENT]**

29. As I’ve said, **national efforts alone are not enough**. Developed countries must honour their **aid and financing commitments** to help close the budget gaps for addressing our many needs.

30. We must push for **urgent reform of the international financial architecture** to create a more **inclusive and equitable system**. To do so, we need to rethink how we **measure progress**, moving beyond the narrow indicator of **GDP**, which does not reflect inequality, wellbeing, or environmental sustainability.

31. We therefore welcome the inclusion in the **Pact for the Future** of an initiative to develop **new multidimensional progress indicators**, to better guide international cooperation—ensuring that **middle-income countries** like Peru, where pockets of poverty and exclusion still exist, are included in financing flows.

---

**[POVERTY AND ANNOUNCEMENT OF RESOLUTION]**

Mr President,

32. The fight against **poverty in all its forms and dimensions**, including **extreme poverty**, remains the world’s greatest challenge and must be our **highest priority**.

33. In Peru, we are implementing programmes such as **JUNTOS**, **PENSIÓN 65**, and **CONTIGO** to reduce **monetary and extreme poverty**, especially caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and to deliver basic social inclusion services to underserved sectors.

34. I wish to announce that Peru will present, as it does every two years, a **draft resolution titled “Human Rights and Extreme Poverty”**, encouraging Member States to adopt **more ambitious social protection policies**, since extreme poverty and exclusion undermine **human dignity**.

---

**[NEW TECHNOLOGIES]**

Mr President,

35. We also face new challenges from the **rise of new technologies**, whose opportunities come with risks and unprecedented **ethical and moral dilemmas**.

36. **Social media**, while connecting us, has also been used to **spread disinformation and hate speech**, and to perpetrate **violence and harassment**, especially against women.

37. **Tech companies** store personal data of millions, raising concerns about **privacy rights** and the dangers of **mass surveillance** by governments.

38. **Artificial Intelligence**, while offering benefits, has also enabled **disinformation campaigns** aimed at manipulating public opinion—especially during elections—thus **destabilising democracies**.

39. We have a **collective responsibility** to ensure that new technologies are developed and used in full respect of **human dignity, freedom, and rights**. Clear principles and **regulatory frameworks for digital governance** are essential. We therefore welcome the adoption yesterday of the **Global Digital Compact**.

---

**[HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY]**

Mr President,

40. Peru’s **commitment to human rights and democracy** is unwavering. These are the fundamental values that underpin Peruvian society and guide our foreign policy.

41. Peru has a long tradition of promoting and respecting human rights, demonstrated by our participation in numerous treaties and our cooperation with the UN and other international organisations, who have always had full access to our country.

42. The **strong democratic conviction** of the Peruvian people drives our foreign policy in **defence of representative democracy in the Americas**, and **against attempts to undermine the popular will**.

43. The **absence of freedom and democratic political participation**, coupled with **repression and lack of opportunity**, drives **mass migration and refugee flows**, putting pressure on host countries—especially those lacking economic capacity. That is why we reaffirm our commitment to an effective, **legally binding global framework for migration**, based on a **human rights and people-centred approach** that provides **predictability and protection** against **transnational criminal organisations involved in trafficking and smuggling**.

44. These foreign policy principles inform Peru’s **grave concern over the situation in Venezuela** following the 28 July electoral process. The officially declared results have failed to meet Venezuela’s legal obligation to transparently and impartially disclose original vote tally sheets, and therefore do not legitimately reflect the popular will. Peru **cannot recognise these official results**.

---

**[CLOSING]**

Mr President,

45. Throughout its history, Peru has maintained a foreign policy firmly committed to **multilateralism**, **international law**, and the **peaceful resolution of disputes**—principles enshrined in the UN Charter.

46. This tradition is exemplified by the contributions of renowned Peruvians such as **Víctor Andrés Belaúnde**, President of this Assembly; **José Luis Bustamante y Rivero**, President of the International Court of Justice (1967–1970); and **Javier Pérez de Cuéllar**, the fifth **UN Secretary-General**, who remains an inspiration for our diplomatic corps.

47. In this era of growing scepticism toward multilateralism, that legacy calls on us to remain active in promoting **effective multilateralism**, which is essential to our joint response to major global challenges—ensuring international peace and security, protecting the environment, mitigating climate change, financing sustainable development, and regulating emerging technologies.

48. **Mr President, you can count on Peru’s full support** in forging the global consensus we need to move forward together.

**Thank you very much.**
