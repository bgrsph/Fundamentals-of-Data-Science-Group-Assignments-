Dear colleagues,

It is an honour for me to speak before you today on behalf of Canada, and on behalf of Canadians.

I wish to acknowledge that I join you today on the traditional territory of the Lenape [LEN-ah-PAY] people.

This acknowledgement is important, because today in Canada, we mark the **National Day for Truth and Reconciliation**, a day on which we recognise and commemorate the Indigenous Peoples who came before us and who continue to live on this land.

We acknowledge the pain caused by decades of abuse, neglect, and racism.

It is also an opportunity for us to commit to doing better—and to repairing the wrongs of the past in order to move forward, together.



Ours is a country based on the rights and freedoms that are

enshrined in our constitutional Charter.

A core reason Canada is a prosperous society - is that beyond

offering the freedom to pursue a better life for you and your family —

it also provides a freedom from the barr-lers that prevent you from

enjoying a better life.
Freedom from fear, violence, intimidation and discrimination.
Freedoms that foster a sense of inclusivity and belonging.

Freedom that protects the vulnerable and builds stronger

communities.

Far too often, though, some of the loudest voices claiming to

speak for freedom are the ones trying to redefine that word for

their own purposes.


They claim freedom as an excuse to do -as they wish- without any

regard for the freedom of others.

That is certainly not how we should define freedom.



They hide behind the word to tell us everything is broken,

to spread disinformation; and

parrot the lines fed to them by those who wish to interfere in our

elections and undermine our democracy.

They weaponize the term “freedom” to further marginalize those in

the most vulnerable situations,
to justify spreading hate, and

even deny people their right to make choices about their own

bodies.

Including limits on reproductive rights.


At the end of the day - through all of the noise - what they really

mean to say is: freedom for some - but not for all.

Often, the people who claim to speak for freedom are the same

people who want the government to decide

who people can love,

who they are, or

even what they can wear.

We see it in our country. We see it around the world.

At the international level we see it when groups or countries declare

that international law doesn’t apply to them.

AFGHANISTAN

In Afghanistan, we see it taken to its extreme - as the Taliban

continue to impose inhumAne rules against women and girls.


Banning them from being in public so they are invisible,
Robbing young girls of the fundamental right to an education.

How is that respecting human dignity? How is that protecting the

best interests of their people?

They need to be held accountable.

Last week, Canada joined Australia, Germany and the Netherlands,
with the support from 22 other countries, to take steps to hold
Afghanistan accountable under the Convention on the Elimination

of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.

The Taliban cannot make international law disappear through

simple decrees.


Canada is a country that values freedom from oppression — not the

freedom to oppress others.

There should be nothing controversial about protecting human

rights - including the dignity of all men and women alike.


HAITI

On Haiti, the world cannot sit idly by as people suffer.


**The unchecked gang violence and corruption in Haiti have created a catastrophic situation for the population, plunged into deep insecurity where civilians are gunned down and children die of hunger.**

Canada has always maintained that the solution to this crisis must come *from Haitians, for the benefit of Haitians.*

In this regard, the Presidential Transitional Council and the transitional government are striving to restore order—but they cannot do it alone.

The Haitian people need a multinational security support mission that works in partnership with the Haitian National Police—not only to help restore order, but also to meet the basic needs of the population.

That is why Canada has invested more than **$100 million** in support.  
**Canada is doing its part.**

We must all show the Haitian people that we will *not* abandon them.

The United Nations Security Council must be clear in this regard.

I wish to thank **CARICOM** and **Kenya** for the essential roles they are playing in responding to this crisis.

**Together, we can achieve lasting peace and stability in Haiti.**



MIDDLE EAST

Mr. President,

What continues to happen in the Middle East is an unspeakable

tragedy.

Thousands have been killed in Israel, Gaza and Lebanon - including

many Canadians.

This is a senseless war that goes against the dignity of human
beings.
The suffering — on all sides - must end.

What the world continues to witness is a repeated cycle of violence

where civilians pay the heaviest price.


Canada is joining those urging Israel and Hezbollah to accept an
immediate ceasefire. We need to create space for peace talks and

save lives.


There cannot be war in Lebanon. Full stop.
UN Security council resolutions must be respected.

Families in Southern Lebanon and families in Northern Israel must

be able to safely return to their homes.

We have - and always will- insist that civilians be protected,

wherever they’re from.


Next week marks one year since the terrorist attacks by Hamas

against Israel.


Last March,  I  visited kibbutz Kfar Aza — one of communities attacked

on October 7°.

 I  met Ayalet, a mother grieving her son who was murdered in the

attack — he died protecting his fiancée.

Ayalet recounted the terror of that day. The search for loved ones in

burned homes.

As she spoke about the horrors of October 7th,

we heard the bombs as they landed on Gaza nearby and felt the

ground shudder.

In that moment, the duality of the tragedy befalling the Israeli and

Palestinian people was profound.

It is a moment  I  will never forget.

The situation in Gaza is inhumane.

The level of suffering is unacceptable. It must stop.

Innocent Palestinians, women and children, cannot pay the price of

defeating Hamas. It must end.
A ceasefire is needed immediately. Hostages must be released.
This requires both sides making real efforts.


Mr. President,

For lasting peace, Canada has long advocated for a two-state

solution.
We believe both Israelis and Palestinians have the right to exist.

We all know a negotiated agreement is the best chance for Israelis

and Palestinians to live side by side in peace and security.

Unfortunately, Hamas, a terrorist organization, continues to operate
in Gaza, refuses to release hostages and refuses to lay down its

weapons.

Meanwhile, the government of Israel is against the creation of a

Palestinian State.

Violence against Palestinians by extremist settlers and expansion of

settlements by Israel in the West Bank continue unabated.
This is unacceptable.


Canada supports the creation of a Palestinian State.

That is why we are providing security and development support to

the Palestinian people.

We will officially recognize the State of Palestine at the right time,
when it is most conducive to building a lasting peace, and

not necessarily as the last step of a negotiated process.

More than anything, this conflict has led to unspeakable pain.
Communities are hurting.

People have the right to protest peacefully. But nobody has the

freedom to intimidate others.
Polarization is a problem. Division is real.

We have a collective responsibility to bring people together.


UKRAINE
Mr. President,

It’s now been 2 and a half years since Russia launched its illegal

invasion of Ukraine.
The human cost continues to grow.

No country has the freedom to invade its neighbor.

There’s no freedom to impose your will on others.

This aggression is a blatant violation of the UN Charter.


Russia needs to get out of Ukraine now.


The Ukrainian people have the right to be free from fear, free from

aggression.

They have the right to decide what their own future should be.


Mr. President, we all know that if Russia’s aggression goes

unchecked here - it will continue.

Many countries in the region, and the hemisphere, are wondering if

they will be next.

The world must not back down in denouncing this unjustifiable

aggression.

Canada will not back down fromits support for Ukraine.


At the end of October, Canada will host a conference co-organized
with Norway and Ukraine on the human dimension of Ukraine’s 10-

point peace formula.

We will focus on the return of children to their families as well as

deported civilians and prisoners of war.

Every one of those affected by this war is entitled to freedom from

violence and from being forced from their home.


UN REFORM


**Mr President,**

The issues I have just raised present enormous challenges.  
This institution has a role to play in helping us move forward **together** toward solutions.

Critics of the United Nations accuse it of being incapable of solving the problems the world currently faces.

Worse still, some—more conspiratorially minded—go so far as to claim that the UN is the cause of many of these problems.

Both camps ignore the reality and the strength of this organisation.

The United Nations provides a unique forum that allows us to come together and speak with one another on **equal footing**—to try to bridge our differences, however deep, through dialogue and the pursuit of consensus.

This is why **Canada supported the adoption of the Pact for the Future** at last week’s **Summit of the Future**.

The Pact is a starting point as we work together to ensure the long-term vitality of this organisation.

The UN is not a perfect organisation—it’s true—but **progress is possible here**.

As the Secretary-General said: *“We simply cannot build a future for our grandchildren with a system built by our grandparents.”*  
Let us build that future **together**.



**Mr President,**

For nearly 80 years, no woman has held the post of Secretary-General.  
This is **unacceptable**.

Last week, I had the great honour—alongside my colleague from Jamaica—of hosting in Toronto some fifteen women foreign ministers from around the world.

Our conclusion is clear:  
**The next leader of this distinguished institution must be a woman.**

It is high time that we can say, proudly, from this podium and around the world:  
**“Madam Secretary-General.”**

And I would say the same for the presidency of the General Assembly.

Mr President, with all due respect,  
I hope that next year, delegates will address **Madam President**.

I know that many of us **share this hope**.



**Mr President,**

Let me tell you about my mother.  
She will be so proud that I’m speaking about her at the United Nations.

You know, my mother and grandmother are among the millions of women around the world who fought fiercely for **equal rights**.

They did so alongside the mothers and grandmothers of many in this very chamber.

Recently, my mother told me that **we now belong to the “generation of consolidation.”**  
And she is absolutely right.



Being part of our generation means that we need to consolidate the
gains that have been made over time and fight against those who are

trying to roll back this progress.

It also means that we need to continue to fight so that women and
girls everywhere have the right to make choices about their own

bodies and their own lives.
We see the difference this gap in freedoms creates.

When women are robbed of the right to decide when to have

children, they lose out on education and job opportunities.

When women don’t have access to safe abortions their lives are put

at risk.


When women are denied access to safe contraception and fertility
treatments, they lose the power to make choices that have the most

profound impacts on their lives.

Attacks on sexual and reproductive health rights are an attack on

equality rights. They’re an affront to basic dignity.




**We must always have the right to choose for ourselves:**  
which methods of contraception to use, the choice to have an abortion, or to pursue assisted reproduction.  

**We, as women, have the right to be equal in all things:**  
in education, in employment, and in every other opportunity.  

**We are women, and we are proud to be so.**  
We can never go backward.  

**Together, we must continue to move forward—for our sisters, our daughters, and our granddaughters.**  



Mr. President,

Two years ago,  I  stood here and said countries around the world

were faced with a choice.
And we still have that choice today.

We can choose a world where rules can be broken by the powerful —

bringing us back to darker times of tension and conflicts.

Or we can choose a world that upholds human rights, opportunities

for all, peace and prosperity.
Where people work together to solve problems.

Canada will work with partners to move us beyond this moment of

crisis.
A new future is being shaped.
We must not fail.

Thank you.
