**Mr President of the General Assembly,  
Mr Secretary-General of the United Nations,  
Your Majesties, Excellencies, and Highnesses,  
Distinguished Ministers, Ladies and Gentlemen,**

1. Allow me at the outset to congratulate His Excellency Mr Philémon Yang on his election as President of the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. I wish him success in his mandate, and I would also like to extend my thanks to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr Dennis Francis, for his efforts in the success of the previous session.

2. I seize this opportunity to reaffirm the Kingdom of Morocco’s full support for the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr António Guterres, especially his ambitious initiative to convene the **Summit of the Future**.

**Mr President,**

3. Hardly a year passes without our gathering here being marked by rapid and complex developments in the international context. We face accelerating transformations driven by the massive advances in communication, information technology, and artificial intelligence, intertwined with evolving societal needs and global challenges.

4. The sense of collective belonging that once accompanied the founding of the United Nations has eroded, giving way to uncertainty that now pervades all areas of human activity. Today, we face the challenge of redefining our modes of production and consumption, models of governance, and even the very structure of our societies.

5. This reality was highlighted by His Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God assist him, in a message to participants of the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund held in Marrakesh. I quote:  
> “At a time when our planet is facing climate disruptions that are imposing a new reality—confirmed by data day after day—the world remains mired in problems we thought had been largely resolved, thanks to the multilateral rules and institutions established in the aftermath of the Second World War.” *(End of quote.)*

6. We are therefore entitled to ask: Has multilateralism run its course? Is it time to acknowledge its failure and consider alternative models of global governance? Are we truly forced to choose between multilateralism and idealism?

**Mr President,**

7. The Kingdom of Morocco has based the doctrine of its multilateral diplomacy, under the wise guidance of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, on firm principles—**ambition and clarity**—and its methods on **innovation and realism**, aiming to evolve cooperation with historic partners in line with changing needs, and to build appropriate frameworks with new partners based on **solidarity**, shared experience, and mutual benefit. All of this is guided by a central objective: confronting the challenges of security, development, and stability.

8. For Morocco, multilateral action has never been an outdated idealism or short-term political opportunism. Despite its flaws and shortcomings, **multilateralism remains the only viable path** to face our shared challenges and the existential threats we all confront.

9. However, it is no longer sufficient to merely reflect on the shortcomings of multilateralism or issue declarations of intent to reform it. It has become necessary to breathe new life into this reform process by mobilising all available energies—especially **young people and women**. After the **Summit of the Future**, how can we shape our collective future without involving these groups in designing the forms and content of multilateralism to come?

10. From the same conviction, we affirm that multilateralism is **a tool and a lever for developing countries** to defend their interests, highlight their priorities, and benefit from opportunities for cooperation and shared expertise.

**Mr President,**

11. **Climate change** remains at the forefront of the major challenges facing our planet. A look at reality leads to the conclusion that African countries are among the **most affected by the impacts of climate change**, despite being among the world’s **least responsible** for it. At the same time, they allocate significant portions of their resources to debt repayment.

12. It is essential, therefore, to **revise borrowing frameworks and rules** to better account for the constraints faced by African countries in adapting to climate change.

13. Morocco calls for the creation of **innovative financial mechanisms** that enhance the positive impact of climate funds while ensuring sound debt management.

14. Likewise, we must **accelerate the reform of the international financial architecture** to better meet the needs of developing countries, including through fair access to financing and the ability to invest in their own development.

15. We also call for more adequate **representation of African countries** on the boards of the World Bank and other multilateral banks to reinforce the democratic nature of their governance and promote more productive approaches in addressing debt crises that severely affect African economies.

16. As current Chair of the **Group of Middle-Income Countries** at the United Nations for two consecutive years, Morocco continues to advocate for multilateral measures that can safeguard the development momentum these countries have achieved.

**Mr President,**

17. Guided by the visionary leadership of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God assist him, the Kingdom of Morocco continues to advocate for a **realistic, solidarity-based, and pragmatic multilateralism** that serves the interests of the African continent, supported by effective decision-making mechanisms.

18. This is the approach Morocco is implementing in various areas, including **climate change**, **migration**, and the **fight against terrorism**.

19. It also includes the implementation of major **social reforms** to achieve **social justice**, notably the **universal social protection programme**. Thanks to this transformative initiative, which is backed by a budget exceeding **47 billion dirhams by 2026**, millions of people will benefit from **direct social assistance**.

20. In confirmation of Morocco’s strategic focus on the **Atlantic**, and based on the deep conviction that the **Atlantic Sahel** can become a space for human connection, economic integration, and a centre for continental and international influence, His Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God assist him, has called for **strengthened integration and cooperation among African Atlantic countries** within the framework of the **Rabat Process**.

21. This **royal initiative for South–South cooperation**, grounded in the principles of joint action and solidarity, aims to transform the **African Atlantic space into a region of peace, stability, and development**.

22. Furthermore, His Majesty, may God assist him, launched an **ambitious initiative to facilitate access by Sahel countries to the Atlantic Ocean**, affirming their rightful place in the global economy. This pioneering royal initiative seeks to be a **pillar of prosperity, peace, and stability** for this part of the African continent.

23. The same spirit of solidarity underpins the project to establish the **Morocco–Nigeria gas pipeline**, a regional integration initiative aimed at fostering **shared economic recovery**. This project, involving **13 African countries**, seeks to boost development across the Atlantic coast.

24. Our continent can certainly rely on the **wisdom of its leaders** and the **creativity of its youth**, but it also looks to the **solidarity and cooperation of the international community** to address its challenges.

**Mr President,**

25. The Kingdom of Morocco remains firmly committed to the **peaceful settlement of disputes** in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

26. Accordingly, Morocco remains committed to reaching a **final political solution to the regional dispute over the Moroccan Sahara**, based **exclusively on the Autonomy Initiative** and **within the framework of Morocco’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity**—a solution that would open new horizons for development in the region.

27. The growing and unwavering support from many countries for Morocco’s sovereignty over its Sahara and for its Autonomy Initiative is a **clear message** to the other parties and to the United Nations that **the time has come to move towards a political solution** based on this initiative, through **a series of round-table discussions** in accordance with **UN Security Council resolutions**.

28. In this context, Morocco supports the efforts of the **UN Secretary-General** and his **Personal Envoy** to **relaunch the political round-table process**, with the participation of all four parties, to reach a realistic, pragmatic, and lasting political solution, based on consensus and in accordance with **Security Council Resolution 2654**.

29. I must also reaffirm Morocco’s principled positions as reiterated by His Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God assist him, to the UN Secretary-General:

- No political process outside the framework of **UN-led round-table discussions**, with the full participation of Algeria.
- No solution outside the framework of the **Moroccan Autonomy Initiative**.
- No serious political process without the **cessation of armed provocations** by militias, as demanded by members of the Security Council.

30. At the same time, the **tangible development** in the Moroccan Sahara continues at one of the highest rates seen in the Kingdom, thanks to the projects carried out within the framework of the **New Development Model for the Southern Provinces**. The population of the region **actively participates**—through their democratically elected representatives in regional councils—in all stages of implementing this ambitious political framework. Their active engagement in the political, economic, and social life of the Kingdom reflects their unwavering attachment to **Morocco’s territorial integrity and the Moroccan identity of the Sahara**.

**Mr President,**

31. His Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God assist him, affirmed in his address marking the 45th anniversary of his accession to the throne of his illustrious ancestors that:

> “Our focus on the domestic situation of our country does not make us forget the tragedy experienced by our Palestinian brothers.”

32. Morocco joins the voices of other **Islamic and Arab states** in expressing deep concern over the **grave and unprecedented situation** in the occupied Palestinian territories since **October 2023**. Thousands of civilians, most of them women and children, have been killed or injured, and the **destruction and comprehensive blockade of Gaza** continue, in **blatant violation of international law and fundamental humanitarian values**.

33. His Majesty has laid out a vision to overcome this crisis, based on the following principles:

- **First**, while achieving a **ceasefire in Gaza** is an urgent priority, it must be accompanied by the **opening of a political horizon** capable of establishing a **just and lasting peace** in the region.  
- **Second**, any resumption of negotiations to revive the peace process between Palestinians and Israelis must be **shielded from extremism**—wherever it comes from.  
- **Third**, peace and stability in the region cannot be achieved without a **two-state solution**, wherein **Gaza is an integral part** of the territory of the **independent Palestinian State**, with **East Jerusalem as its capital**.

34. On the **humanitarian front**, His Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God assist him, in his capacity as **Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee** of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, has worked to open an **unprecedented land corridor to deliver urgent food and medical aid** to the people of Gaza.

35. The Kingdom of Morocco expresses its **profound concern over recent developments in the Middle East**. All indicators suggest we are facing a **dangerous and unprecedented situation** that could **expand the scope of conflict**, with unpredictable consequences for the entire region.

36. His Majesty had previously warned that **the political deadlock in the Palestinian issue** is one of the **primary causes of tension** in the Middle East. His Majesty has long cautioned against managing the conflict **without a realistic and sustainable solution**, as this has led to widespread frustration and hopelessness, along with repeated devastating crises—humanitarian tragedies that dangerously threaten **regional stability, peace in the Middle East, and international security**.

37. I must also express Morocco’s **full solidarity with the brotherly nation of Lebanon—its government and people—**in the face of the aggression it is enduring, and we insist on the **need to respect Lebanon’s territorial integrity and national sovereignty**.

---

**Mr President,**

38. The **sheer volume of global challenges** confronting us calls for the **awakening of our collective conscience**, for **improved working methods**, and for a **stronger foundation of shared values**.

39. Today, the United Nations is at a crossroads: it must **restore the spirit of active solidarity, shared responsibility, and genuine humanism** that inspired its founding. We must move beyond simply repeating the need for reform, particularly as we approach the Organisation’s **80th anniversary**.

40. The **Summit of the Future**, held at the start of this session, the **Social Summit in 2025**, and the **2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development** represent **shared visions of the future** and **roadmaps that must be implemented**—so that we may finally begin to catch up on the significant delays we have accumulated.

**Peace and God’s mercy and blessings be upon you.**
