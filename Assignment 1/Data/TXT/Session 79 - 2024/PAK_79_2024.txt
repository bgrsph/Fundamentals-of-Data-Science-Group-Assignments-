**Mr. President,**  
**Heads of State and Government, Excellencies,**  
**Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,**  
**Assalamu Alaikum!**

It is a matter of great honour for me to address the United Nations General Assembly for the second time as the Prime Minister of a country that has always been a proactive member of the UN family.

I would like to congratulate and wish you success, Mr. President, on your election as the President of the 79th Session of the UN General Assembly. I also thank Ambassador Dennis Francis for his skilful stewardship of the 78th Session of the UNGA.

**Mr. President,**

The Father of our Nation, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, declared in 1947 that:

> *"We stand by the United Nations Charter and will gladly make our full contribution to peace and prosperity of the world."*

Pakistan has stood by this commitment.

Today, we face the most daunting challenges to the world order: Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza; a dangerous conflict in Ukraine; destructive conflicts across Africa and Asia; rising geopolitical tensions; resurging terrorism; increasing poverty; stifling debt; and the mounting impact of climate change. We feel the chill of a new Cold War.

In response to these challenges, our Secretary-General António Guterres called for the **Summit of the Future**, which earlier this week led to the adoption of 54 action items across development, peace and security, technology, and global governance in the **Pact for the Future**.

**Mr. President,**

Today, I stand before you to express the searing pain and anguish of the people of Pakistan at the plight of the people of Gaza. Our hearts bleed as we witness the unfolding tragedy in the Holy Land—a tragedy that shakes the very conscience of humanity.

Can we, as human beings, remain silent while children lie buried under the rubble of their shattered homes? Can we turn a blind eye to mothers cradling the lifeless bodies of their children? This is not merely a conflict—it is a systematic slaughter of innocent people; an assault on the very essence of human life and dignity. The blood of Gaza’s children stains not only the hands of the oppressors but also those who are complicit in prolonging this cruel conflict.

When we ignore their endless suffering, we diminish our own humanity. It is not enough to condemn; we must act now and demand an immediate end to this bloodshed. We must remember that the blood and sacrifice of innocent Palestinians will not be in vain.

We must work toward a **durable peace** through the **Two-State Solution**. We must seek a viable, secure, contiguous, and sovereign State of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders, with **Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its eternal capital**. And to advance this goal, Palestine must be immediately admitted as a **full member of the United Nations**.

**Mr. President,**

In a matter of days, Israel’s unrelenting bombardment of Lebanon has killed over 500 people, including women and small children.

The failure to implement UN resolutions has emboldened Israel. It now threatens to drag the entire Middle East into a war with consequences that could be grave and beyond imagination.

**Mr. President,**

Like the people of Palestine, the people of **Jammu and Kashmir** too have struggled for a century for their **freedom** and **right to self-determination**.

Instead of moving towards peace, **India has reneged on its commitments** to implement Security Council resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir. These resolutions mandate a plebiscite to enable the people of Jammu and Kashmir to exercise their fundamental right to self-determination.

Since **5 August 2019**, India has taken **unilateral and illegal steps** to impose what its leaders ominously call a “Final Solution” for Jammu and Kashmir.

Day in and day out, **900,000 Indian troops terrorise the people** of occupied Jammu and Kashmir with **draconian measures**, including prolonged curfews, extra-judicial killings, and the **abduction of thousands** of young Kashmiris.

At the same time, in a **classic settler-colonial project**, India is seizing **Kashmiri lands and properties** and settling **outsiders** in the territory to transform the Muslim majority into a minority. This tactic, employed by all occupying powers, has always failed—and it shall fail in Jammu and Kashmir too, InshaAllah.

The **Kashmiri people are resolute** in rejecting the false Indian identity that New Delhi seeks to impose. India’s brutal policies have ensured that **Burhan Wani’s legacy** continues to inspire the struggle and sacrifices of millions. Their defiance is rooted in legitimacy, and their stories remind us that behind every statistic lies a human life—a dream deferred, and a hope shattered.

Even more worryingly, **India is expanding its military capabilities**, targeting Pakistan. Its war doctrines envisage **a surprise attack and a “limited war under the nuclear overhang.”**

India has rejected Pakistan’s proposals for a **mutual Strategic Restraint Regime**. Its leaders have openly threatened to **cross the Line of Control** and “take over” **Azad Kashmir**. Let me say clearly: **Pakistan will respond most decisively to any Indian aggression.**

To achieve **durable peace**, **India must reverse its unilateral and illegal measures**, taken since 5 August 2019, and enter into a **dialogue for a peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute**, in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.

**Mr. President,**

Remember: **Illegal occupation creates a fresh hell every day**, in the killing fields of **Palestine** and **occupied Jammu and Kashmir**.

**Mr. President,**

Beyond conflict, the 21st century has brought a cascade of crises, including the **reversal of development** and the **mounting impact of climate change**.

Two years ago, Pakistan suffered **catastrophic floods**, causing **$30 billion in damages**. It is now clear that every summer brings **blistering temperatures** and **new climate disasters**. Pakistan emits less than **1% of global carbon**, yet pays a **disproportionate price**. This is **unfair in any calculus of global justice**. We must uphold the principle: **the polluter pays**.

Pakistan looks forward to the **fulfilment of commitments** made by development partners, including a **new annual goal beyond $100 billion** in **climate finance**, to support SDGs and climate goals.

**Mr. President,**

Nearly **100 developing countries** are trapped in a vicious cycle of **debt and liquidity crisis**—what I call a **“death trap”**, not just a **“debt trap”**. Achieving the SDGs in these conditions remains a distant mirage.

The **international financial architecture**—which the Secretary-General has rightly described as “morally bankrupt”—must be reformed, as must **world trade and technology regimes**, to promote development and global equity.

**Mr. President,**

Since assuming office in **March this year**, my sole focus has been the **well-being and prosperity of Pakistan’s 240 million people**.

We have taken **difficult but necessary decisions** that rescued the economy from collapse, restored macroeconomic stability, controlled fiscal deficits, and strengthened our reserves. As a result, **inflation has dropped to single digits**, and prospects for growth have improved.

**Mr. President,**

Located at the **crossroads of South and Central Asia and the Middle East**, we have prioritised **geo-economics and regional connectivity** to ensure **win-win outcomes**.

The **second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)** has been launched. Through the **Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC)**, we are mobilising investments in **infrastructure, renewables, minerals, agriculture, and technology**—ushering in a **new era of development**.

**Mr. President,**

For **two decades**, Pakistan has fought terrorism **boldly and successfully**, defeating terrorist groups on our soil. We have paid a heavy price: **80,000 martyrs**, including schoolchildren, and **$150 billion in economic losses**.

Unfortunately, we now face a **new surge** of **externally-sponsored terrorism**, especially by **TTP/Fitna al-Khawarij** and its associates.

Let there be no doubt: we are **determined to eliminate this threat**, through our comprehensive national effort, **Azm-e-Istehkam** (Resolve to Promote Stability). We will also work with the international community to **combat terrorism** and **reform global counter-terrorism frameworks**.

**Mr. President,**

Pakistan seeks the **earliest possible normalisation** of the situation in **Afghanistan**. We support the UN’s call for **$3 billion in humanitarian aid** for millions of suffering Afghans.

At the same time, we expect the **Afghan Interim Government** to respect **human rights**, especially those of **women and girls**, and to promote **political inclusion**.

The Interim Government must also **neutralise all terrorist groups** within Afghanistan, especially those responsible for **cross-border terrorism**. These include **ISIL-K (Daesh)**, **TTP/Fitna al-Khawarij**, and others such as **ETIM**, **IMU**, and **Ansarullah**.

**Mr. President,**

One of the most troubling global trends is the rise of **Islamophobia**: desecrations of the **Holy Qur'an**, attacks on **mosques**, **stereotyping of Muslims**, and violence and discrimination.

The most alarming manifestation is the **Hindu supremacist agenda in India**, which seeks the **subjugation of 200 million Muslims** and the erasure of **India’s Islamic heritage**.

Pakistan and the **OIC** will work with the **UN Secretary-General** and his **Special Envoy** to implement a **plan of action to combat Islamophobia**.

**Mr. President,**

Pakistan calls for an **immediate end** to the **tragic conflict in Ukraine**, and a **peaceful resolution** in line with the **UN Charter** and international agreements.

We have a proud history of **solidarity and cooperation with Africa**, and we will continue to support African nations in counterterrorism and peacebuilding through **UN operations**.

**Mr. President,**

As we leave this august hall, we must carry a message to our people:

> *That the weak are not voiceless. That the oppressed must not lose hope. That poverty is not pre-ordained. And that the Almighty’s promise of justice and equality in our only terrestrial home must be fulfilled.*

**I thank you.**
