**Mr President,**

**Mr Secretary-General of the United Nations,**

**Distinguished Delegates,**

I have the great privilege and immense honour of conveying to you, on behalf of His Excellency Captain Ibrahim TRAORÉ, President of Burkina Faso and Head of State, the fraternal and friendly greetings of the brave people of Burkina Faso, who—despite all adversities, including the ignominy of aggressors and enemies of peace, manipulation, and all forms of interference—have shown remarkable resilience in continuing their radiant march toward inclusive economic and social development.

Mr President, it also gives me pleasure, on behalf of the Government and the people of Burkina Faso, to warmly congratulate you on your brilliant election to the presidency of this 79th regular session.

To your predecessor, Mr Dennis Francis, I extend our congratulations for the achievements recorded during his term, despite an international context marked by deep divisions.

**Mr Secretary-General,**

Burkina Faso greatly values the efforts undertaken by the UN system and its partners, under your leadership, to support the Government’s efforts on the ground.

It is in this context that we welcome the theme—so evocative and urgent—chosen for this 79th General Assembly:  
**“No one left behind: Acting together to advance peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for present and future generations.”**

In addressing this theme, allow me to express the voices of Sahelian society, and particularly those of Burkina Faso:

- *I am a Burkinabè farmer*, guardian of traditions and customs. I toil with pride on the land passed down by my ancestors to feed my family and ensure their well-being.  
**I want to live free, dignified, and proud!**

- *I am a woman, a mother*, a proud descendant of Princesses Yennenga and Guimbi Ouattara, like so many other courageous Sahelian women, with unparalleled strength of character.  
I would give my life to ensure the survival and fulfilment of my children, siblings, and compatriots in a society of peace and love.  
**I want to live free, dignified, and proud!**

- *I am a Burkinabè youth*—farmer, herder, trader, civil servant, artist, artisan, student—youth from every region and walk of life, committed to contributing to Burkina Faso’s development.  
**I want to live free, dignified, and proud!**

- *I am a child*, boy or girl, from towns and villages, or among the internally displaced.  
**I want to live free, dignified, and proud!**

- *I am a Burkinabè living abroad*, a hardworking, determined and honest worker, from the "Land of the Upright People". Even from afar, I contribute to the common struggle for peace and stability in my country and region.  
**I want to live free, dignified, and proud!**

- *I am a Burkinabè, Malian, or Nigerien soldier, or a Volunteer for the Defence of the Homeland (VDP)*—husband, wife, parent, child, sibling.  
I have sworn to defend my country with my life, to fight the enemy with courage, and to protect my fellow citizens from all harm.  
**I want to live free, dignified, and proud!**

**Mr President,**  
These aspirations guide the Government’s efforts to build a society where the men and women of the Sahel can live in freedom, dignity, and pride.

The theme of our session, commendable for its relevance, in fact revives a fundamental concern as old as the UN itself—discussed at length across decades in this very hall. We are no longer at the stage of debating what must be done. The time has come to give substance to our words through **concrete actions**.

We must move beyond rhetoric to genuinely build a fairer world—free of prejudices and stereotypes that relegate entire peoples and regions to the margins, condemned to isolation and scorn, dependent on aid offered at the whim of those who presume to dictate global order.

We must refocus our efforts on the core objectives of the United Nations—ensuring the **well-being of peoples through peace and security**.

This urgency is especially relevant today as our world faces **persistent crises**, complex conflicts, and an unequal economic system that deepens fractures between states and divisions between peoples, with devastating human consequences.

These dire circumstances reflect a **multilateral system at a crossroads**, undermined by partisan and predatory behaviour from certain member states who act as self-proclaimed "masters of the world," pursuing foreign policies based on domination and exploitation.

This is a matter of grave concern for global harmony and cohesion. Burkina Faso therefore uses this platform to once again appeal for **wisdom and reason**, particularly from the world’s major powers, in favour of an **inclusive global governance**, free of hegemonic visions.

That is the only way to restore the **nobility of the United Nations.**

**Mr President,**

- **Restoring territorial integrity**, ensuring the safety of people and property, and
- **Rebuilding political, administrative, economic, and financial governance**, in line with the aspirations of the Burkinabè people for a better life,
- **Pursuing reforms and development initiatives** for shared prosperity and sustainable progress:

These are the key goals pursued under the leadership and foresight of His Excellency Captain Ibrahim TRAORÉ, President of Burkina Faso.

The Burkinabè people, like other Sahelian peoples, have embraced the struggle for sovereignty and have mobilised behind their defence and security forces.

With this unwavering support—and thanks to patriotism, innovation, bravery and sacrifice—Burkina Faso has achieved significant and once-unthinkable progress in the fight against **terrorists manipulated, guided, and funded by neo-colonial powers.**

Let us pay solemn tribute to all the civilians and soldiers who have fallen in this struggle.

Thanks to **strategic and visionary reforms**, notably:

- Enhanced troop capacities,
- Reorganisation of combat forces on the ground,

We have **multiplied our operational means**, leading to major successes:

- In 2022, only 40% of the territory was under state control. That has now risen to nearly **70%**.
- Over **700,000 displaced people** have returned to their villages.
- Around **1,500 schools** have reopened, giving thousands of pupils a renewed chance to study.

These achievements—made possible through the **Defence and Security Forces**, the **patriotic commitment of the VDPs**, and the support of **the Burkinabè diaspora**—include the mobilisation of **CFA 99 billion** (around **USD 165 million**) in 2023 alone, far surpassing expectations.

This shows the resolve of the Burkinabè people to **fund and lead their own struggle** against terrorism.

**Mr President,**

While we are achieving victories on the ground, malicious forces have launched **slanderous and stigmatising campaigns**, accusing our forces of human rights abuses without any proof. This orchestrated propaganda seeks to demoralise Burkinabè patriots and undermine their legitimate struggle.

We call on UN member states not to be swayed by this media agitation, which ultimately reflects the **despair of routed terrorists and their sponsors**.

We reaffirm the **professionalism** and recognised contributions of our Defence and Security Forces in peacekeeping operations. Systematic training in **international humanitarian law** ensures their commitment to human rights.

Despite the global consensus on fighting terrorism, we are alarmed that **certain states are supporting terrorist groups**.

The **Ukrainian government**, in a shocking admission, claimed responsibility for **terrorist attacks in Tinzawaten, Mali** that killed Malian troops. This constitutes direct support for terrorism and a **violation of the UN Charter and international law**.

These revelations echo long-standing patterns:  
- **Partitioning of Africa, assassinations of leaders, foreign interference, and resource plunder**.
- Manipulation of national elites and regional organisations.
- Use of **proxy wars**, such as those in the Sahel.
- Proliferation of military bases and access to **sophisticated weaponry** by armed groups.

This **new form of terrorism** threatens the very foundations of our states and of the United Nations. We call for **urgent, decisive action**.

The AES countries have already referred the Ukrainian aggression to the **UN Security Council** (on **20 August 2024**) and await a firm response.

**Mr President,**

Facing security imperatives, **Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger** created the **Alliance of Sahel States (AES)** on **16 September 2023**—a **mutual defence pact** against terrorism and organised crime.

To tackle development challenges, the AES expanded its cooperation to other critical sectors, culminating in the **historic summit of 6 July 2024** in Niamey.

There, the Heads of State—Capt. TRAORÉ (Burkina Faso), Col. GOÏTA (Mali), and Gen. TIANI (Niger)—established the **Confederation of Sahel States**.

The popular support for AES reflects the failure of **regional bodies** to respond to our people’s legitimate security concerns.

The Confederation’s primary objective is to **protect Sahelian populations**, already facing severe humanitarian crises—now worsened by **deliberate punitive measures**.

**Mr President,**

As this session urges us to leave no one behind, the world remains plagued by escalating tensions that threaten peace and security, while the UN looks on helplessly.

Burkina Faso calls for diplomacy to resolve such crises. We believe that **the spirit of the UN Charter** can extinguish tensions, wherever they arise—**in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Asia or the Americas**.

In this spirit, we support the **UN-led political process** in **Western Sahara**, aiming for a **mutually acceptable, negotiated solution** as per the relevant Security Council resolutions.

In the **Middle East**, we reaffirm our solidarity with the **Palestinian people**, enduring unprecedented suffering. The **two-state solution** remains the only viable alternative—Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace. Burkina Faso supports the full UN membership of Palestine as part of this vision.

We also reject **unilateral coercive measures**, which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. We call for the **immediate lifting of sanctions** against countries like **Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Iran**, and others—whose only "crime" is the pursuit of sovereignty and freedom.

Regarding development, Burkina Faso stresses that even the most promising commitments **cannot succeed without good faith and collective responsibility**.

And on UN reform, it is high time that **Africa is granted full representation in the Security Council**, in line with the **Ezulwini Consensus**. This is essential for universal legitimacy and to correct a historic injustice.

**Mr President,**

In conclusion, Burkina Faso believes in the United Nations. However, we call for its actions to **respect the sovereignty, strategic choices, and fundamental interests** of its member states.

A **wind of renewal** is blowing through the Sahel, stirred by the rise of the **AES Confederation**. This new community of integration is **not directed against any country or people**, but seeks to work with sincere partners—**free from hypocrisy**—to combat terrorism and insecurity in the Sahel.

**God bless Burkina Faso!**  
**God bless the AES Confederation!**  
**God bless Africa!**  
**The homeland or death—we shall overcome!**

**Thank you.**
