**Mr President of the General Assembly,  
Mr Secretary-General,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,**

**Peace be upon you, and God’s mercy and blessings.**

The seventy-ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly comes amidst dangerous circumstances confronting the Middle East, in which the international order faces a difficult test that threatens its existence and leaves it incapable of achieving the objectives for which it was established—chief among them, the maintenance of international peace, security, and human rights.

Today, we witness unprecedented violations of international charters and norms, and the sidelining of international institutions that are meant to manage and regulate international relations, promote peace and stability, and elevate human relations away from violence and brutality.

Important principles—such as sovereignty, territorial integrity, multilateral cooperation, the laws of war, international humanitarian law, the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), and the right to self-determination—have been ignored. The world is being pushed towards large-scale confrontations and conflicts, while the UN Security Council stands paralysed and ineffective.

With the absence of responsibility, there is a growing resort to alternative mechanisms, and the disregard of these institutions portends a return to a state of chaos in international relations.

At the same time, we must not forget to commend the courageous positions taken by certain individuals who head these international bodies, including the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr António Guterres. Nevertheless, despite considerable efforts, we clearly see the absence of effective impact.

**Ending the violations taking place in Palestine and the region is the responsibility of all, especially the Security Council, which has failed to achieve its most essential purpose: maintaining international peace and security.**

In occupied Palestine, we are witnessing an entire population subjected to aggression by a military occupying power. Millions are being displaced without deterrent, thousands are being killed, and there is open talk of the collective starvation of this people to exterminate them, and of the use of nuclear weapons against them by senior officials of the occupying entity—without any effective international response.

The international community and its member states have failed in their legal obligation to provide protection, as required under international law.

The Palestinian people have been denied the right to live with dignity in a state of their own—like all other peoples—amidst global inaction and complicity. Criminals are being enabled and emboldened, the conflict is expanding, and attacks on others are being supported and legitimised, ensuring repeated impunity for perpetrators.

We have also witnessed continued disregard for international law and Security Council resolutions, reduced to mere ink on paper, in a series of attacks against regional states, occupation of territory, annexation, and redrawing of borders by force—contrary to international resolutions. These are dangerous precedents that threaten the entire international system and undermine the foundations of global institutions, with dire consequences for humanity as a whole.

In a further act of extremism, the occupying power selectively invokes Security Council Resolution 1701 to justify its aggression against Lebanon, while ignoring numerous other resolutions and foundational principles of international law, including Resolutions 242, 246, 252, 265, and 297.

We are witnessing a brutal campaign of indiscriminate killing and the use of remote-controlled technology for bombings, with complete disregard for unarmed civilians—a dangerous precedent indicating the depth of the occupying power’s involvement in crimes against humanity.

**Iraq, under its government and people, and under the guidance of the Supreme Religious Authority, stands in solidarity with Lebanon and its brotherly people**, as they face a new chapter of premeditated aggression aimed at plunging the region into further conflict. We had warned of this before and will continue to provide all possible assistance to overcome the consequences of these attacks.

Our position is based on a long history of interconnectedness and a well-known Iraqi commitment that rejects aggression and occupation, and defends the right of peoples to their land, heritage, and sanctities. We repeatedly condemn any international support or justification of the aggressor’s actions.

We also document the **continued targeting of international agencies and humanitarian organisations** in the occupied territories, including direct harm to UN personnel, such as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza, which should be protected under international law. These attacks not only impede humanitarian work, but also violate the international standards protecting civilians and humanitarian workers in conflict zones.

These recent actions by the occupation aim to destabilise regional countries by igniting a large-scale regional war. As a founding member of the United Nations, Iraq hopes this institution can achieve its founding goals—preserving peace and security, and shielding the world from the scourge of war and tragedies of history.

Let me express **our disappointment at the UN Security Council and international system’s failure** to fulfil their responsibilities.

**Ladies and Gentlemen,**

We note a significant rise in hate crimes and intolerance affecting our security and stability. We are in dire need of **international cooperation to promote tolerance, mutual respect, and the fight against hate speech, discrimination, and violence**, which are increasing globally.

Among the most visible forms of hate speech today is **the growing phenomenon of Islamophobia**, which undermines global efforts to foster peace, security, and coexistence. It sets the stage for attacks on our moral and social values, which are integral to our human identity.

I therefore call on the United Nations to step up its efforts to **promote dialogue and understanding between cultures and religions**, and to prioritise unity and harmony in the face of polarisation. I urge leaders and heads of international institutions to stand firm against religious intolerance and hatred.

**Excellencies,**

As for Iraq—contrary to what I have described elsewhere—there are promising developments. A country that once had one-third of its territory occupied by ISIS and was considered by many observers to be beyond repair, is today, a decade later, witnessing the implementation of a comprehensive plan for reconstruction and development. Life is returning to the cities, skyscrapers are rising, infrastructure is being rebuilt, and security prevails.

We still face many fundamental challenges in implementing economic, administrative, and environmental reforms and diversifying the economy. We have made great strides in achieving security and defeating terrorism, and we will soon crown that victory with an important joint declaration with our allies and friends who stood with Iraq against this barbaric threat to the world.

We are working to strengthen democracy in Iraq, to **establish a new social contract and national cohesion**, in line with our 2005 Constitution. We have held provincial council elections—delayed for ten years—and are preparing for **parliamentary elections in the Kurdistan Region**.

Our efforts continue to enhance the relationship between the **federal government, the Kurdistan Regional Government, and local governments**, as defined in the Constitution and law. We are committed to protecting minorities and diverse communities, and to meeting their needs. Promoting justice and preserving diversity are among our highest priorities—we consider diversity one of Iraq’s greatest assets.

**Ladies and Gentlemen,**

This government has five core priorities:
- Creating job opportunities  
- Improving public services  
- Combating poverty  
- Fighting corruption  
- Implementing economic reforms  

The Iraqi government is working to rebuild human capital and has made significant progress in **building state institutions** and asserting the **rule of law**. We are also striving to activate the **private sector**, reduce administrative inefficiency, diversify income sources, reform the financial and banking sectors, manage the energy transition, and address the root causes of **social and economic instability**, and thereby, political instability.

This transition is complex for Iraq, due to its **structural economic challenges**, particularly the reliance on the **public sector to absorb labour** and the consumption of **oil revenues for salaries**. The country faces a dual challenge: **excessive dependence on oil income** and an **inability to diversify the economy**, resulting from decades of wars, economic sanctions, destructive policies of the former dictatorship, mismanagement, and the squandering of material and human resources.

**Governance, anti-corruption, digital transformation, and e-government** are among our top priorities. These are key strategies to limit corruption and promote good governance. However, we also call on the **international community to support our efforts** in **recovering stolen Iraqi funds** and overcoming the **legal and regulatory barriers** some countries have erected to provide safe havens for illicit funds—such as banking secrecy and the concealment of beneficial ownership, which enable perpetrators to escape accountability.

**Excellencies,**

Iraq seeks to enhance **regional security and stability** through constructive partnerships to face shared challenges, with cooperation among stakeholders and increased mutual interdependence serving the common good. We are planning to propose initiatives that promote regional economic integration and stability, foremost among them the **Development Road Project**, which aims to transform Iraq into a **key regional hub** for trade and transport by connecting the Middle East to Europe via Iraq. This includes railways, highways, industrial cities, and the linkage of **Iraq’s Grand Al-Faw Port** to Europe through neighbouring countries.

This is one of the most significant regional integration initiatives and aligns with Iraq’s broader goals of rebuilding its economy and improving public services.

**Ladies and Gentlemen,**

Iraq is facing **serious environmental challenges** as a result of **climate change and desertification**—challenges that cannot be addressed without enhanced international cooperation. Desertification and the loss of vegetation are displacing millions in search of stability, exacerbating **social and political crises**.

We call for **international solidarity to confront these environmental threats** and raise awareness about the importance of **sustainable water management**, a core issue for Iraq. Addressing this challenge requires a commitment to **the principle of shared and equitable responsibility among states**, as Iraq faces existential threats due to severe water shortages, affecting agriculture, the economy, and the lives of millions of Iraqis.

Accordingly, the Iraqi government has placed the **utmost priority** on these files, and is working in cooperation with neighbouring countries to reach sustainable solutions and policies to address these impacts.

**Finally…**

I would like to express **our deep gratitude to the United Nations** for its support to Iraq over the past two decades. We now look forward to a new phase of cooperation with the UN, starting at the end of 2025. We hope this will mark the beginning of a new era of **stability and prosperity** for our people, and a **renewed chapter in our partnership** with the UN, as we work diligently to build a better future for our coming generations.

Iraq’s selection as **Chair of the Group of 77 and China for 2025** is a victory for **constructive Iraqi diplomacy**, which is committed to development goals, bridging the technological divide between the Global North and South, achieving integration, and reforming the global economic system.

During our presidency of the largest bloc in the United Nations—comprising 134 countries—we look forward to working toward a **more just and stable world**, where all peoples have access to development opportunities.

**In conclusion…**

Our policy places **Iraq, its people, its security, sovereignty, and prosperity first**. We move forward with confidence, erasing the legacies of war, dictatorship, and terrorism, as we rebuild Iraq and restore its rightful **regional and global position**.

**Peace be upon you, and God’s mercy and blessings.**
