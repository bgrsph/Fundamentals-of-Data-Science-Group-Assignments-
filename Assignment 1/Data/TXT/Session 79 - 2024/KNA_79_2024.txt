  
Remarks at 79th Session of United Na5ons General Assembly 
Prime Minister of St. Kits and Nevis Hon Dr Terrance Drew September 27th, 2024 
Mr President, Secretary-General Guterres, esteemed colleagues, excellencies, my fellow ci:zens of our twin-island Federa:on of Saint Kits and Nevis, and friends from every corner of our shared planet. 
Today, I rise on behalf of my small island developing state, and yet in truth, I speak for the many small island na:ons—large ocean states— that know too well the high cost of inac:on. We are small, yes, but our voices carry the weight of rising seas, thundering storms, and livelihoods teetering on the edge of erasure. A sustainable future for SIDS demands more from us all. 
Let me begin by paying tribute to His Excellency Dennis Francis, whose leadership and Presidency of the 78th session demonstrated the fierce determina:on of the Caribbean. We stand ready to drive the changes necessary for a sustainable, secure world. Thank you for your sterling leadership, Mr President. 
I must also acknowledge Secretary-General Guterres, who, with unflinching resolve, has championed jus:ce, equity, and hope. This past year tested our commitment to peace and security, yet it also revealed the vast opportuni:es we must seize if we are to steer humanity toward a be>er way. 
Mr. President, I congratulate you on your elec:on as the President of this 79th session of the United Na:ons General Assembly. We have great confidence in your leadership as you guide us with the theme, “Unity and diversity for advancing peace, sustainable development, and human dignity, everywhere and for all.” 
As we convene here in this hallowed hall, I recall the words of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan: "The future of peace and prosperity that we seek for all the world's peoples needs a founda=on of tolerance, security, equality, and jus=ce." That founda:on is fragile, but it is essen:al. And it is crumbling under the weight of neglect, greed and abuse of power. 
GLOBAL DIPLOMACY NEEDS A HEAVY DOSE OF HUMANITY 
Seventy-nine years ago, in the wake of war’s devasta:on, visionaries sought to build a world where diplomacy and dialogue could triumph over destruc:ve intolerance. Yet, today, we stand on the precipice of a perilous return to a world where peace is kept at gunpoint, where weapons are roman:cized, and violence is exalted in the pursuit of absolute power. 
We need more than diploma:c pla:tudes. We need a humanity steeped in decency, jus:ce, equity and inclusivity. We must rise from these chambers, not resigned to the idea that the children of Hai:, Congo, Sudan, and Pales:ne are less deserving of the rights and freedoms that we enjoy. We are all one people, one world. We cannot have peace without jus:ce, nor jus:ce without true, solid equality. 
RISING TIDES, RISING THREATS 
In the Caribbean, our lived reality is of rising :des washing away our hopes, of unforgiving heat se‘ng ablaze our dreams. We pray for rain and receive the flood, dragging our homes and our future to the abyss.  
When the guns flood our communi:es, tearing children from their mothers’ arms, it is a collec:ve cry for ac:on.  
When the Global South starves while food wastage con:nues unabated, we must be shaken from our complacency. 
The harsh truth is that the world is becoming mortally insecure. We stand on disappearing shores. We are besieged by storms natural and man-made. Corporate greed, colonial arrogance, and unchecked consumerism have torn apart our social contract with each other. We are no longer at peace with Nature. 
  
SECURITY CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT SUSTAINABILITY 
The greatest delusion we feed ourselves is that security and sustainability are separate endeavours. They are, in fact, intertwined. We cannot build secure na:ons while allowing the climate crisis to rob future genera:ons of their birthright. Security is more than an absence of conflict; it is the presence of dignity, of jus:ce, and hope. 
Genera:ons ago, the Labour Movement in Saint Ki>s and Nevis paved the way for our people’s emancipa:on—an emancipa:on built on the principles of social, economic, and human dignity. Today, I echo their call: We must DO be>er. We must BE be>er. Our ambi:ons must be grander, our vision clearer. 
When we say, “leaving no one behind: ac/ng together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for present and future genera/ons” it cannot be a hollow phrase. It must be a sacred commitment —a pledge to every soul, from the wealthiest na:on to the smallest island state. For when the waters rise in the South, even the North will eventually drown. When the forests burn in the North, the South too will choke from the smoke. For it is one Planet; one Human Race. 
THE SDGs: A LIFELINE FOR OUR FUTURE 
The pandemic has lef scars that s:ll fester, and global economic fragmenta:on threatens to deepen the divides between us. For small island states like mine, the failure to meet these goals is not just a disappointment; it is a death sentence. The clock is :cking, and we cannot afford to wait any longer. 
Today, the Caribbean braces for an intense hurricane season, facing the escala:ng fury fueled by warming oceans and unprecedented storms. Our brothers and sisters in Grenada, Carriacou and Pe:te Mar:nique, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, are s:ll recovering from the devasta:on of Hurricane Beryl, which became the earliest-formed Category Five hurricane on record this past July. In the Pacific, our colleagues remain exposed to the incessant ba>ering of typhoons that ravage their islands. And as I speak, the southeast United States is being pounded by hurricane Helene. Lives and livelihoods hang in the balance, as en:re communi:es brace for the next assault. 
Hoteliers in my own country of Saint Ki>s and Nevis have approached our government, sta:ng with a sense of dread, that they may soon no longer be able to market themselves as beach resorts. Our famous beaches, once the lifeblood of our tourism-driven economy, are steadily disappearing under the relentless rise of the sea. The sands that once beckoned visitors from across the globe are now receding, swallowed by seas which con:nue to rise. The loss will be irreversible if we do not act. 
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were meant to shield us from such devasta:on, offering a progressive agenda to build resilience and safeguard our ci:zens. Yet despite their promise, according to the UN’s 2024 SDGs Report, only 17 percent of the targets are on track. Nearly half are showing minimal or moderate progress, and over onethird have stalled or even regressed. The clock is :cking, and we must do more than observe its passage—we must act before these reali:es become permanent fixtures in our collec:ve future. 
INVITATION TO SHAPE THE FUTURE TOGETHER: GLOBAL SUSTAINABLE 
ISLANDS SUMMIT 2025  
In May 2025, the Government of St. Ki>s and Nevis will proudly co-host the Global Sustainable Islands Summit with Island Innova=on, a pivotal event dedicated to advancing sustainable development on islands across the globe. Titled "Sustainable Future for Island Communi=es," this summit will build on the momentum of the SIDS4 Conference held in 2024, tackling the pressing challenges island na:ons face. This summit will be a call to ac:on, a space where we shape prac:cal solu:ons and partnerships that ripple far beyond our shores. Our islands are the sen:nels of climate change and the proving ground for sustainable development. It is with this spirit of shared responsibility and urgent ac:on that I extend a hearnelt invita:on to all leaders of island na:ons gathered here to come, to engage, and to commit to meaningful change.  
ADOPTION OF THE MVI SHOWS WHAT’S POSSIBLE WHEN WE WORK 
TOGETHER   
A recent and commendable stride toward equity and inclusion has been the adop:on of the Mul:dimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI). This serves as a powerful testament to the poten:al of mul:lateralism when it is both purposeful and effec:ve. Saint Ki>s and Nevis stands with the Caribbean Community and the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) in welcoming resolu:on 78/322, while urging this esteemed body to rally the necessary poli:cal will and resources to drive its implementa:on across interna:onal financial ins:tu:ons and mul:lateral development banks. 
For us small island developing states, the MVI is not just another metric; it is a lifeline, offering a means to cushion the relentless blows of clima:c and economic crises that dispropor:onately affect us. Its full implementa:on will demonstrate to the world that the United Na:ons, and by extension the global system, remains commi>ed to uplifing those most vulnerable. It will restore trust in a system that must not only recognize vulnerability but ac:vely work to address it. 
REFORMING GLOBAL GOVERNANCE: A CALL FOR JUSTICE 
The :me has come to reshape the United Na:ons, to reform its structures so that they reflect the reali:es of our modern world. Too many voices remain unheard, too many na:ons marginalized. The UN Security Council must include representa:on from the regions most vulnerable to the threats of our :me—La:n America, the Caribbean, and Africa. 
Nowhere is this change more urgently needed than in the interna:onal financial architecture. Saint Ki>s and Nevis stands in solidarity with the Government of Barbados in its fight for financial and climate jus:ce, pledging our full support for the Bridgetown Ini:a:ve. This bold framework demands a reforma:on of global finance, making it more responsive to the unique vulnerabili:es of Small Island Developing States. We cannot build resilience without first ensuring that the interna:onal system works for the most vulnerable among us. 
SUSTAINABLE ZONES OF PEACE AND SECURITY 
In the Caribbean, we con:nue to call for and guard our zone of peace. The Argyle Declara:on serves as a shining example of how we in the Caribbean manage security challenges. We go back to basics: we talk to each other. Specifically, the Declara:on has been instrumental in facilita:ng dialogue between Venezuela and Guyana, demonstra:ng that even the most complex disputes can be navigated through peaceful means. This model of engagement—one of dialogue and coopera:on— is the very essence upon which this ins:tu:on was founded. The interna:onal community would do well to follow this approach and inject new life into our diplomacy. 
To this end, I reiterate CARICOM’s call for an uncondi:onal ceasefire in Gaza, to put an end to the suffering. The only pathway to peace and to secure fundamental human rights and dignity is through the two-state solu:on. 
HAITI 
As we face these global challenges, we cannot forget Hai:. Hai:, the beacon of resilience and courage, stands at the crossroads of its next chapter. Saint Ki>s and Nevis, alongside the Caribbean Community, firmly supports the work of the Na:onal Transi:onal Council as it strives to create an environment conducive to a mul:-stakeholder poli:cal solu:on. Hai: was there for the downtrodden of the world, ligh:ng the path toward freedom for many, and now the world must be there for Hai:. Not because it is a place of sorrow, but because it remains a symbol of human endurance and defiance against injus:ce. With the establishment of the Mul:na:onal Security Support Mission, the Caribbean Community seeks to usher in a new day for Hai:’s families— a day where schools become places of learning, hospitals are places of healing, and markets are not arsenals for gangs, but havens for community and prosperity. Hai:’s future is not only one of security but one of sustainability, and we must rally to give it the peace it deserves. 
CUBA 
Year afer year, this body sends a strong message to the people of Cuba. The embargo that has isolated Cuba for decades is illegal and con:nues to be a stain on our collec:ve conscience. Saint Ki>s and Nevis joins the Caribbean Community in calling for an end to this unjust embargo and for Cuba’s removal from the State Department’s list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. Cuba has long been a friend to the Caribbean, its doctors and educators exemplifying true philanthropy. Instead of denigra:ng this island, we should elevate and learn from its sustainable solu:ons that have empowered their people and, in turn, the region. A stronger, more sustainable Cuba enhances the security and sustainability of the Caribbean. 
TAIWAN 
In the same breath, we must not forget Taiwan. The people of Taiwan have proven, :me and again, their firm commitment to sustainable development. The theme of this Assembly, "leaving no one behind," compels us to ensure Taiwan’s inclusion in the work of the United Na:ons System, par:cularly in the World Health Organiza:on and the Interna:onal Civil Avia:on Organiza:on. Taiwan’s leadership in innova:on and technology is not just an asset; it is a necessity for the global community to meet the challenges of tomorrow. The United Na:ons must extend its vision to include Taiwan, a na:on whose exclusion undermines the very principles we stand for: peace, sustainable development, and human dignity. 
CONCLUSION: A MOONSHOT FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE 
Mr President, esteemed colleagues, Saint Ki>s and Nevis stands before you today, not seeking pity, but partnerships. We are on a transforma:ve journey to become the Western Hemisphere’s first Sustainable Island State, guided by seven pillars: Water Security, Energy Transi:on, Food Security, Sustainable Industry, Sustainable Se>lements, Circular Economy, and Social Protec:on. 
We are taking bold, tangible ac:ons: 
• Building renewable energy desalina:on plants for a reliable 24/7 water supply. 
• Aggressively advancing geothermal energy on our sister isle of Nevis, with the goal of a unified, sustainable energy grid for both islands. 
• Construc:ng our first, modern, climate-smart hospital. 
• Building climate-smart, affordable housing solu:ons, ensuring that our people have a safe, sustainable place to call home. 
• Finalizing one of the Caribbean's largest solar-plus-storage projects. 
• We are on track to meet CARICOM’s 25 by 25 agenda, reducing our food imports and bolstering local food produc:on. 
• We created a Children’s Medical Fund to ensure that disadvantaged families can access vital medical care for their children abroad. 
• We con:nue to advance educa:on beyond our universal, compulsory system, promo:ng lifelong learning as key to na:onal development. 
My friends, we stand at a crossroads. We can no longer afford the luxury of inac:on. We must meet the moment with the courage it demands. We must reject business as usual and embrace a new path forward—one that values people over profit, one that priori:zes the planet over power. As we gather in this assembly, let us remember: we are all stewards of this fragile world. The rising :des do not respect borders, and the fires of conflict burn without discrimina:on. 
For Saint Ki>s and Nevis, for the Caribbean, for every small island na:on whose future hangs in the balance—I ask you to stand with us. Let our voices rise like the oceans that surround us, powerful and unyielding, calling for a future where peace is not just the absence of war, but the presence of jus:ce, of sustainability, of hope. 
Together, let us seize this moment and shape the future. Together, let us stand proud and strong. 
LET US ACT NOW! 
Thank you.
