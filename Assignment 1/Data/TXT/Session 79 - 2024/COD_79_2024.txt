**Mr President of the United Nations General Assembly,**

It is with immense honour that I address you today, for the first time since the Congolese people renewed their trust in me by electing me to a second term as Head of our Nation. Having had the opportunity to speak before you in the past, I am particularly moved to do so again at this significant moment for our country.

I would like to congratulate you, Mr Philémon Yang, on your election as President of this 79th Session, and I also pay tribute to your predecessors for their unwavering commitment to this institution.

The theme of this session—**“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”**—deeply resonates with our aspirations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

**Mr President,  
Mr Secretary-General of the United Nations,  
Heads of State and Government,  
Heads of Delegation, Ladies and Gentlemen,**

Multilateralism and respect for a rules-based global order have been fundamental pillars supporting peace, security, health, and prosperity across the world for nearly eight decades. The United Nations embodies these core values and remains a vital actor in facing the great challenges humanity must overcome—whether ensuring security, tackling climate change, or combating poverty. This reality calls for enhanced multilateral cooperation.

However, the noble ideal of the drafters of the United Nations Charter—that of serving as an instrument through which all nations regulate their conduct—seems to be fading. The foundation of collective security it established is wavering.

We have a responsibility to unite our efforts and reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism, which is the key to truly transformative solutions to the challenges plaguing our world. As former UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld, who gave his life for peace in the Congo, wisely said:  
**"The purpose of the United Nations is not to take humanity to heaven but to save it from hell."**

In this critical period, multilateralism is of paramount importance. It enables us to confront shared threats, protect our planet, and strengthen civil society and human rights.

We cannot ignore the alarming rise in belligerent rhetoric and the shameful resurgence of armed aggression and the looting of natural resources, affecting every continent. The ongoing Russia–Ukraine conflict is but one manifestation of a broader crisis threatening global peace. Yemen, Sudan, Syria, and the horrifying tragedy unfolding in Gaza are all situations where multilateralism must fully play its role.

We must act together to advance peace, sustainable development, and human dignity, thereby ensuring a better future for generations to come. Let us leave no one behind.  
This is the clear and meaningful message embodied in the theme guiding the 79th Session of this august Assembly.

**Mr President,**

The **“Pact for the Future”** and its annexes—the **Global Digital Compact** and the **Declaration on Future Generations**—adopted during the recent Summit of the Future, underscore the importance of active collaboration to achieve a shared vision of a peaceful and prosperous future.

These documents reflect a critical commitment to ending conflicts, eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, and addressing challenges such as population displacement, irregular migration, food insecurity, pandemics, and the risks posed by new technologies.

The **Global Digital Compact** stands as a vital pillar in our pursuit of prosperity in the heart of the fourth industrial revolution, where digital technologies are now indispensable. This digital transformation presents an unprecedented opportunity to achieve the **Sustainable Development Goals by 2030**, especially for the least developed countries. It seeks to close the digital divide and include the unconnected in high-impact digital services.

However, to meet this digital revolution's inherent challenge, **global reforms** are needed—including a reassessment of the international financial architecture and the provision of adequate funding.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo thus aspires to attract investment to expand connectivity in Africa and calls for cooperation from multilateral partners and telecommunications providers—along with essential knowledge transfer.

Indeed, building the country’s infrastructure is a promising solution for linking southern and northern Africa, and for connecting the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean. This includes forming viable partnerships around the **Grand Inga hydroelectric project**, which aims to meet our continent’s growing energy demands—exacerbated by the proliferation of connected devices.

We must also enhance the **traceability of strategic minerals**, critical for technological equipment, to ensure responsible and sustainable exploitation of our resources.

Furthermore, **the full participation and engagement of youth**, both girls and boys, are essential for building a sustainable and inclusive society. This principle underpins the **Declaration on Future Generations**, emphasising our responsibility to future generations and the importance of decisions that ensure their well-being. For Africa, its youth is a major asset for future prosperity.

We must invest in education, particularly in **STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)**, and create innovation-friendly environments. Addressing the disconnect between a rapidly growing young population and the labour market is crucial, and we must equip young people with the necessary skills for their integration.

**Mr President,**

The situation in the **eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo** is particularly concerning. The resurgence of the **M23 terrorist group**, backed by **Rwanda**, has triggered an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, with **nearly 7 million internally displaced people**. This aggression is a blatant violation of our **national sovereignty**.

We call on the international community to **firmly condemn these acts** and to **impose targeted sanctions** on Rwanda for its destabilising role.  
We demand the **immediate and unconditional withdrawal** of Rwandan troops from our territory.

While recent diplomatic efforts—such as the **Luanda talks**—are encouraging, they must not distract from the urgency of this action.

The DRC is fully committed to establishing lasting peace in the East, fostering economic development, and improving the social welfare of communities devastated by this conflict. However, we will not forgo our sovereignty or territorial integrity in pursuit of peace.

We are fully committed to implementing the Luanda process roadmap—which I strongly support—seeking high-level dialogue to restore trust between the DRC and Rwanda and to prevent the current security crisis from escalating into a regional war. The DRC remains open to any initiative from our partners that advances this noble goal of peace.

We reaffirm our determination to secure lasting peace. Under my leadership, we are committed to implementing the **P-DDRCS** (*Disarmament, Demobilisation, Community Reintegration and Stabilisation Programme*), a cornerstone of our national strategy to disarm and reintegrate combatants while stabilising conflict-affected areas.

As MONUSCO phases out, we are prioritising the **repatriation of foreign combatants**. I invite our partners and friends to support this vital peace mechanism.

Moreover, thousands of victims of the **genocide for economic gain in the Democratic Republic of the Congo** (referred to as **GENOCOST**) continue to suffer the devastating consequences of a past marked by violence and impunity. Acknowledging and addressing the effects of this tragedy is essential to support the recovery and rebuilding of affected communities.

Beyond immediate humanitarian assistance, a long-term approach focused on **justice, reconciliation, and sustainable development** is critical to helping victims rebuild their lives with dignity.

It is for this reason that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has decided to **institutionalise 2 August** as **GENOCOST Day**—dedicated to the victims of heinous crimes perpetrated by rebels supported by multinational corporations and regional States.  
This commemorative day represents a national act of remembrance and healing, confronting a painful past in order to move forward.  
It is crucial for strengthening the historical consciousness of our nation and affirming our resolve to **prevent the recurrence** of such atrocities.

**Mr President,**

**Terrorism** poses a serious threat to international peace and security, affecting all world regions. Having ravaged Asia, Western Europe, and North America, it now appears to be **taking root in Africa**.

As a member of the **Global Coalition against Daesh (ISIS)**, the DRC urges the United Nations to **intensify efforts** to implement the coalition's recommendations, particularly under the **Aqaba Process**.

Terrorism in our eastern region is closely linked to the **illegal exploitation and looting of natural resources**. These criminal activities fund armed groups, fuelling instability and prolonging conflict in the **Great Lakes region**.

Therefore, the United Nations must adopt **severe sanctions** against those responsible for such **economic crimes**. Only by breaking this vicious cycle can we promote peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for future generations.

**Mr President,**

According to the latest **Voluntary National Review Report** on the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, the DRC has made significant progress towards several targets thanks to major reforms and interventions.

Since 2019, our government has introduced **free primary education**, allowing nearly **4 million children** to enrol in school.

We have also undertaken measures to **strengthen social protection**, launch **Universal Health Coverage**, promote **gender equality**, and accelerate **infrastructure development** and **rapid industrialisation**, including the creation of **Special Economic Zones**.

Despite these gains, the **UN global report** on the SDGs shows that, at the current pace, the DRC will **not meet the SDGs by 2030**, due to persistent inequality and vulnerability—exacerbated by armed conflict.

In response, we have developed a **roadmap** of specific actions, reforms, and interventions to accelerate progress and meet the **2030 Agenda**. Several measures are already being implemented to align the DRC with the SDGs. However, this effort requires **annual investments of approximately $32 billion**.

Thus, it is essential to **strengthen partnerships** for **sustainable investment** and to **promote peace** to enable stable socio-economic development.

In response to global challenges and in the promotion of **renewable energy**, the DRC reaffirms its commitment to ambitious **climate action** and emphasises the need for **increased financial and technical support** to meet the targets of the **Paris Agreement**.

With its rich biodiversity and abundant natural resources, the DRC is a key actor in the fight against climate change. Our efforts to reduce **greenhouse gas emissions** focus on four strategic sectors:  
- **Agriculture**,  
- **Forestry**,  
- **Energy**, and  
- **Waste management**.

We are undertaking **structural reforms** to reverse deforestation and improve access to **clean energy**, reinforcing our commitment to **natural resource conservation** and **ecological transition**.

A major milestone was achieved in **Bali in November 2022** with the signing of the **Joint Declaration on Tropical Forest Cooperation and Climate Action**, by **Brazil**, **Indonesia**, and the **Democratic Republic of the Congo**.

This declaration led to the creation of the **Trilateral Alliance for Tropical Forest Cooperation**, offering a framework to address biodiversity threats and to advance solutions in carbon markets—while upholding the **rights of Indigenous Peoples**.

In line with these environmental efforts, the **Second Summit of the Three Tropical Forest Basins** (Amazon, Congo, and Borneo-Mekong) was held from **26 to 28 October 2023 in Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo**.

This **African-led initiative**, spearheaded by President **Denis Sassou Nguesso**, aims to implement the **UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration** by creating the **first global coalition** committed to restoring **350 million hectares** of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

Tropical forests are a **critical defence against climate change**. The **Amazon, Congo, and Borneo-Mekong basins** host over **80% of the world's tropical forests** and provide essential ecosystem services.

It is imperative that we **centre local communities**—who are instrumental in protecting these forests—in **global governance priorities** to improve their **socio-economic conditions**.

---

The DRC is adopting **legal frameworks** and **institutional mechanisms** to strengthen its position in the global **carbon market**, while remaining open to **partnerships** consistent with the Paris Agreement and national laws.

Growing awareness of the link between **climate instability**, **resource depletion**, and **armed conflict** calls for urgent action. We must recognise the **nexus between climate change, environmental degradation, and security**, and develop **proactive solutions** based on **sustainable practices**.

We call upon the **Security Council** to establish **international mechanisms** integrating **climate security issues** into its deliberations.

---

**Mr President,**

The world faces a major **energy challenge**. Fossil fuel–based systems are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Without a joint effort to advance **renewable energy**, we risk further crises—such as extreme weather and conflicts over natural resources.

The DRC is endowed with **abundant resources**, including **critical minerals** such as **cobalt, lithium, nickel, and graphite**—essential to enabling a **sustainable energy transition**.

We call for **international cooperation** to develop the necessary **technologies and infrastructure**. Our vision is to transform our resource wealth into a driver of **sustainable, inclusive development**, while advancing **education, healthcare**, and **infrastructure**.

**Social inclusion** lies at the heart of our national strategy, ensuring **equitable distribution** of the benefits of progress.

As we invest in climate action and the SDGs, the DRC is ready to play a **central role** in **transforming global energy systems**.

**Together, we can build a future** where energy is **clean, sustainable, and accessible for all**.

**Mr President,**

I would also like to address the crucial issue of **gender parity**.

Although the **equal participation of women and men** in political life is internationally recognised, in practice there remains a gap between **legal equality** and the **reality of power-sharing**. The concerns of women deserve to be **fully integrated** into all major societal decisions.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we are determined to change mentalities and overcome the **societal barriers** that hinder women’s development. It is essential to **involve men** in this process, transforming the social dynamic and highlighting their role in supporting the success of women.

At the national level, the Congolese Constitution enshrines **parity**. The government has also implemented a **strategy to combat gender-based violence**, built around **prevention, protection**, and **reparation** for victims. This strategy is embodied in the **National Reparations Fund for Victims of Sexual Violence linked to Conflicts** and **Crimes Against Peace and Security of Humanity** (FONAREV). Legislation is underway to further guarantee such protections.

I also wish to underscore the **significant progress** made in **women’s participation** in decision-making. For the first time in our country’s history, we have appointed a **woman Prime Minister and Head of Government**.

We are also seeing a **growing presence of women** in government institutions, Parliament, and the judiciary, including appointments of women as **President of the Council of State** and **Governor of the Central Bank of the Congo**.

**Mr President of the UN General Assembly**,  
**Mr Secretary-General of the United Nations**,  
**Excellencies, Heads of State and Government**,  
**Distinguished Heads of Delegation**,  
**Mr President**,  

In this era of transformation and progress, the **international community**, under the auspices of the **United Nations**, must continue to support these dynamics by **reforming itself** to meet the challenges of today’s world.

To maintain the confidence of the international community, the United Nations must demonstrate its ability to **adapt to contemporary changes** and to overcome them with **efficiency and accountability**.

It is imperative to **revitalise multilateralism** through **targeted reforms** of the **UN Charter**, addressing key issues such as the **Security Council**, the **veto right**, **Chapter VII**, and the **use of force**.

However, this alone will not suffice. **Coordination and cooperation** between the various institutions and agencies of the United Nations must also be **strengthened**. Too often, global challenges are tackled **redundantly** across different forums, sometimes with contradictory approaches—while other issues are **entirely overlooked**, each international bureaucracy trying to justify its own existence.

In this regard, while welcoming the support of the United States, I **firmly reiterate**, on behalf of **all African nations**, the **demand for two permanent seats** on the **UN Security Council** for **African countries**. As the UN’s **main decision-making body**, the Council must include **African permanent members** with **all associated rights**, including the **right of veto**, to ensure **equitable geographic representation**.

This is a matter of **justice** for a continent whose role in international affairs is **growing rapidly**. We, Africans, hold this demand with the **utmost determination**.

---

Finally, I cannot conclude without recalling that after more than **three decades of absence** from the Security Council, the **Democratic Republic of the Congo** is once again a **candidate**, supported by the **African Union** and the **Southern African Development Community (SADC)**, for a **non-permanent seat** for the **2026–2027 term**, during the elections to be held in **New York in June 2025**.

The DRC previously held this position during **1982–1983** and **1990–1991**, during which it contributed to the promotion of **peace, security**, and **stability** in Africa and across the world.

Once elected, the Democratic Republic of the Congo intends to play a **proactive role** within the Security Council—contributing to the **revitalisation of the UN Charter** and participating constructively in the Council’s **debates and actions**. We therefore **seek the support** of all Member States for our candidacy.

In these times when **multilateralism is under strain**, the Democratic Republic of the Congo reaffirms its **steadfast commitment** to the **international community**, ready to assume—with honour and responsibility—the mission of shaping a future where **cooperation and peace prevail over conflict and division**.

---

As **Nelson Mandela** once said:  
> “None of us acting alone can achieve success.”  

Therefore, we extend our hand to each of you—**longstanding partners and new allies**—to **jointly write this pivotal chapter** in our **shared history**.

**Together**, let us build a world where **every nation**, whether large or small, can **thrive in dignity and security**.

  
**I thank you.**
