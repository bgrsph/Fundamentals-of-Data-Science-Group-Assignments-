**Mr President of the General Assembly,**  
**Distinguished Heads of State and Government,**  
**Esteemed Foreign Ministers,**  
**Ladies and Gentlemen,**

### I. Opening

We live in a turbulent, volatile world, currently experiencing extraordinarily difficult times marked by tremendous challenges.

Armed conflicts; tensions in every corner of our globe; a crisis of multilateral institutions and the international system; an assault on democratic values from the twin threats of populism and authoritarianism; the dangers of cyberwarfare and the irresponsible application of artificial intelligence; the brutal inequity in wealth distribution; and climate change threatening our very existence—these are but a few of the immense problems we face.

Therefore, I fear that I shall not deliver a speech today that garners sympathy, but rather one that elicits the discomfort and concern we should all feel in light of what is happening. I believe we must be honest and admit that we—all of us—are failing in our mission to build a better world.

That said, if there is any time and place suitable to debate and propose the crucial decisions that can change the course of humanity, it is here at the United Nations General Assembly. Given the delicate moment we are living through, we are duty-bound to act.

The good news is that not all is lost. As a great military hero and later statesman of my country, Bernardino Caballero, once said: “The future is the child of the present.” This means that we can forge a better destiny if we act—here and now.

Thus, even with the "discouragements" that may "lay low many spirits", we may yet "contemplate the luminous horizons of the future"—but only if, as Caballero crucially added, we can make ourselves "worthy of the respect and esteem of future generations".

In other words: we shall only be worthy of the high offices we hold today if we stop sweeping problems under the rug and instead confront them with clarity, firmness, and courage.

Despite the arduous reality we face, I remain optimistic. I do not fear the future, because I trust in humanity’s capacity to overcome its challenges. But it is imperative—indeed, I would say obligatory—that we eliminate the veto in the United Nations Security Council and redefine the mechanisms of international cooperation.

We need to build frameworks that promote equitable and sustainable development, where all countries—regardless of size or power—can benefit equally from global progress. Only then can we fulfil the promises this forum represents and make ourselves “worthy of the respect and esteem of future generations”.

### II. Armed Conflicts

Ladies and Gentlemen, maintaining peace should be the fundamental pillar of multilateralism. Yet today’s reality paints a grim picture: around 20 international armed conflicts and over 110 active internal conflicts worldwide demonstrate that the institutions designed to preserve peace have not fulfilled their mission.

War remains a scourge upon humanity. It tears apart the social fabric, annihilates communities, and leaves behind a legacy of immeasurable suffering. Every lost life stands as testimony to our collective failure to uphold our most basic responsibility: to preserve peace and protect human dignity.

The history of my nation stands as a living testament to the cruelty and immense suffering that wars bring. Paraguay, through the War of the Triple Alliance, endured a war of extermination that, tragically, foreshadowed the genocides of the twentieth century. As another great Paraguayan, Manuel Gondra, once said, Paraguay is a “small but proud country” and survived that bloody war only for that reason.

Yet we know all too well the enormous price a country pays for armed conflict.

For this reason, Paraguay understands better than most not only the calamity of war, but also the cost borne by small nations when invaded or aggressed by more powerful ones.

We therefore express our sincerest solidarity with all victims of armed conflict, whether internal or international. We reaffirm our firm and resolute commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes, and we advocate—without exception—for the non-use of force as a means to resolve disagreements between nations or peoples.

### III. Ukraine, Israel, Africa

In this context, we reiterate our steadfast support for Ukraine, upholding its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We stress the urgency of finding diplomatic solutions that lead to a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace, with the aim of ending this conflict and securing regional stability.

As with Ukraine, we believe that conflicts must be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy, always seeking solutions that respect the fundamental rights of all parties involved. This conviction also guides our position on the escalating crisis in the Middle East.

Our relationship with the State of Israel is founded on strong pillars such as faith and hope. This is why Paraguay has stood firmly by Israel following the grotesquely perfidious attacks by Hamas and intolerant terrorism on 7 October 2023.

Paraguay today reaffirms its recognition of Israel’s legitimate right to defend itself. We also reject any attempt to draw a biased equivalence between Israel’s democratically elected authorities and the leaders of the terrorist group Hamas.

At the same time, we urgently call for the implementation of a solution that alleviates the humanitarian situation, ends the violence, ensures the immediate release of hostages, and promotes constructive dialogue that leads to lasting peace.

We cannot fail to express our deep concern about the situation in Africa, where UNHCR estimates there are currently around 25 active conflicts, some long-standing, others emerging, all with devastating consequences for the lives and futures of the continent’s people. We aspire to the return of peace and stability in this region.

Enough of violence, enough of wars—but also, enough of mere words. As actors on the international stage, we must take firm and effective action.

### IV. Haiti

Today, I must pause to address the grave humanitarian situation in Haiti—an unmistakable example of the shortcomings of multilateralism.

Despite numerous international efforts and interventions, global cooperation has failed to bring about the peace, governance, and security that the Haitian people so urgently need and deserve.

Today, gangs control much of Port-au-Prince, plunging the country into a spiral of violence that multilateral mechanisms have been unable to effectively de-escalate.

To this, we must add a catastrophic humanitarian reality: over 5 million Haitians suffer from food insecurity and face the resurgence of diseases such as cholera. While numerous promises of aid have been made, financial shortfalls and logistical difficulties have prevented humanitarian assistance from reaching those in need in a timely and sufficient manner. There is a worrying disconnect between the promises made by the international community and what is actually delivered on the ground.

We will stand by the Haitian people in every effort to help this sister nation.

### V. Venezuela

My country, like many others represented here today, has known the shadow of authoritarianism and dictatorship. For that reason, Paraguayans today cherish the ideals of democracy and the rule of law more than anyone.

We can speak from experience: for a long time, Paraguay lived under the weight of dictatorship, exile, and banishment. But our present reality is markedly different and vibrant. For over three decades now, Paraguay has reaffirmed its democratic vocation through free and transparent elections. Never before have we enjoyed so many consecutive years of democracy, and I dare say, contrary to the naysayers and pessimists, that—despite its imperfections—this has been the happiest period in our nation’s history.

Perhaps we Paraguayans cannot agree on many things, but we do agree on this: there is no alternative to democracy and the rule of law.

**Democracy is simply non-negotiable.**

Therefore, I must today strongly and unequivocally condemn what is happening to our Venezuelan brothers and sisters.

I come to reiterate Paraguay’s position on the recent electoral process in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which concluded on 28 July. This process ignored the will of the Venezuelan people and was marked by serious acts on the part of the regime, including the persecution of key opposition figures and arbitrary detentions.

The deterioration of democracy in Venezuela is evident, as are the systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. To this must be added actions that run counter to international law, particularly in relation to diplomatic relations and the right to asylum.

We reiterate our support for the democratic forces in Venezuela who are resisting authoritarianism and striving to restore a truly democratic—not merely nominal—system.

### VI. Organisation of American States (OAS)

One of the most persistent critiques of global multilateralism is the idea that all nations are treated equally.

The principle of “one vote per nation” often becomes hollow if smaller nations are forced to trade away their self-determination just to avoid exclusion from major international markets.

Nevertheless, we recognise that regional cooperation remains indispensable for physical and economic integration. The challenges we face cannot be tackled without a convergence of political will among neighbouring countries. In this regard, regional cooperation is the only viable path that allows us to work together and coordinate national policies with other nations.

In this spirit of cooperation and institutional strengthening, Paraguay has decided to present the candidacy of our Foreign Minister, **Rubén Ramírez Lezcano**, for the post of Secretary-General of the Organisation of American States (OAS).

We are convinced that his leadership will significantly contribute to the revitalisation of the OAS, promoting a more inclusive and efficient multilateralism—one that addresses current challenges and prioritises the well-being of all peoples in the hemisphere.

### VII. Taiwan

As part of our commitment to a more inclusive multilateralism—one that leaves no nation behind—Paraguay today reiterates its unwavering support for those countries which, despite their significant global contributions, remain excluded from key international fora.

Paraguay not only recognises but deeply values the international cooperation provided by the **Republic of China (Taiwan)**, a sister nation with whom we have built almost 70 years of a strong and meaningful friendship.

This friendship is based on shared values: democracy, the rule of law, and free trade. It is a genuine friendship, forged in the adversity of being two geographically small countries beside major powers. Yet our spirit of determination is anything but small.

At this Assembly, we renew our strong support for Taiwan to become an integral part of the United Nations system. We believe its exclusion is an injustice we cannot overlook, for the values we share and Taiwan’s contributions to the international community deserve the same recognition as any other nation represented here. If there is any country that should already be part of the United Nations system but is not, that country is Taiwan.

Today, we not only come to denounce this injustice, but also to raise our voice in defence of Taiwan’s integrity and its legitimate right to self-determination.

I underline the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. In a world full of tensions, where conflicts are constantly at risk of escalation, positive and peaceful engagement in this region is vital not only for Asia’s security but for global stability.

### VIII. National Vision – Pillars of Government

Just as we defend the principles of peace, justice, and international cooperation in all corners of the world, it is equally important to reaffirm our commitment to these values within our own borders.

As I mentioned earlier, Paraguay lives in a vibrant and full democracy. With a republican system of checks and balances, and although our political party holds a majority in Congress, we maintain dialogue with the opposition to advance the major reforms our country needs.

We are convinced that democracy must not be empty; it must be a democracy with substance and, above all, with results.

In this regard, economic development is crucial for securing the future strength of our democracy. Prosperity is the greatest enemy of crime, division, and despair. I always say that **the most effective social policy is economic prosperity**.

But for prosperity to reach everyone, we must invest in our human capital and create conditions for families to thrive through their own work.

I wish to highlight two of the flagship programmes of my government. The first is **“Zero Hunger in Schools”**, which aims to eradicate child hunger among school-age children entirely—based on the firm belief that one cannot learn on an empty stomach. The second is **“Che Roga Porã”**, Paraguay’s first-ever housing policy focused on the working class, offering access to homeownership through instalments priced at the level of rent. This will allow thousands of Paraguayan families to convert a monthly expense into a long-term asset.

However, there is no development without security.

To that end, both at the national and international levels, it is logical to adopt a comprehensive view of security, grounded in cooperation between national and international agencies. This is my vision as President of the Republic.

Lastly, we will continue to invest in institutional integrity and transparency as fundamental conditions for development.

Paraguay’s recent achievement of investment-grade status is clear proof of our sustained efforts to strengthen institutions, coupled with a long-standing tradition of economic stability that has consolidated over the years.

Dear friends: **Paraguay wants to, can, and will be a true protagonist on the global stage**. We are determined to claim our rightful place.

### IX. Natural Resources and Climate Change

Paraguay is a country blessed with abundant natural resources, valuable human capital, and a clear focus on creating value chains that promote a green economy based on the development of sustainable technologies.

Our country is a reference point in the production of clean, renewable energy. Hydroelectric power generation is not just a national project, but a joint initiative with our neighbours—an initiative that seeks to be central to the achievement of a more developed, sustainable, and emission-free world.

I firmly believe that **Paraguay is an example of how economic development is entirely compatible with environmental sustainability**.

---

### X. Integration

Paraguay shares common challenges with other landlocked developing countries, which will be addressed in the new Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries to be adopted this December in Botswana.

Far from discouraging us, we see in these challenges an opportunity. We are turning our difficulties into strengths, leveraging our geographic location as a strategic asset. Our position in the heart of South America drives us to be the engine of South American integration.

With a clear vision, we are committed to becoming the region’s logistical hub through two key projects: the **Paraguay–Paraná Waterway** and the **South American Bioceanic Road Corridor**. These are strategic axes for revitalising and strengthening Mercosur and the Pacific Alliance blocs.

As we consolidate our geographic position as a hub for regional integration and logistical development, it is essential that this growth vision be underpinned by strong investment in education.

---

### XI. Education and Technology

Paraguay’s success will depend on our ability to prepare future generations for an increasingly globalised and competitive world.

Alongside education, **technology is a key tool for development and social inclusion**.

There are many challenges facing our nations today. But without doubt, one of the most urgent is the ethical application of artificial intelligence and technological advancements in general.

**Moore’s Law**, which predicts exponential growth in technological development, compels us to design new regulatory frameworks that protect people and are fit to confront a rapidly approaching challenge of almost ungraspable velocity.

These new approaches—such as **regulatory sandboxes** and **co-regulation mechanisms**—must ultimately aim at the **responsible use of emerging technologies and equity in their application**.

---

### XII. Culture and Human Rights

In Paraguay, we are deeply committed to preserving our cultural heritage. At the end of this year, we will host the **nineteenth session of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of UNESCO**, where we hope that **the “Guarania”** will be recognised as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

In addition, we reaffirm our commitment to protecting the fundamental rights of all our citizens, the family, and **human life from conception**, while upholding the traditional values that have shaped our nation’s greatness.

---

### XIII. Conclusion

Although I have adopted a critical stance throughout, I must confess: I am an incurable optimist. I firmly believe that our future is bright and full of opportunity.

I believe in those **“luminous horizons of the future”** I spoke of earlier: if we fight for a better present, we shall see days ahead filled with light and possibility.

The defence of democratic values and respect for human rights must continue to guide us. Political differences are natural and legitimate—but there are principles that are simply **non-negotiable**: democracy, the rule of law, and the unwavering respect for human rights are fundamental pillars.

Even though our political or ideological visions may differ, this should not divide us or hinder our progress in building a cooperation founded on solid ground.

If we uphold the ideals of cooperation, mutual respect, integration, and fraternity among our peoples as our unwavering compass, then I am convinced that better days lie ahead.

In conclusion, and despite the tremendous challenges we are facing, I remain convinced, as **William Faulkner** once said, that:

> **“Humanity will not simply endure: it will prevail.”**

**Thank you very much.**
