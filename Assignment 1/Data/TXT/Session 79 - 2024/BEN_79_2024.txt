Mr President of the General Assembly,  
Excellencies, Heads of State, Government and Delegation,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  

It is with immense honour that I stand before you today at this iconic podium of the United Nations, on behalf of His Excellency President Patrice Talon, President of the Republic of Benin.

Allow me, at the very outset, to reaffirm the unwavering commitment of the Beninese people to democracy, political stability, and the peaceful contestation of power. Since the historic National Conference of the Vital Forces in February 1990, Benin has chosen the path of democracy, and under the leadership of President Patrice Talon, we have succeeded in safeguarding and strengthening our institutions. Our Defence and Security Forces, with courage and republican spirit, continue to protect our territory and our institutions. Any attempt at destabilisation, whether internal or external, will be defeated. Our journey towards development is now irreversible.

Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Today, the world faces mounting tensions, and uncertainty has become a constant of our era. Each day we witness increasing polarisation, with crises that, everywhere, undermine global cohesion and jeopardise the future of humanity. Be it in the Sahel, Sudan, Ukraine, the South China Sea or the Middle East, emerging conflicts threaten global peace and stability. These tensions bring only suffering and despair, triggering waves of poverty that affect the most fragile economies and deepen the vulnerability of populations.

Although Africa is often distant from the origin of these crises, it remains deeply affected. The Sahel region, in particular, has become the theatre of escalating tensions, exacerbated by decisions made without the consent of Africans. This instability severely jeopardises our sustainable development. More troubling still, certain external powers are attempting to import their geopolitical rivalries into our region.

Benin strongly condemns any attempt to turn the Sahel into a new epicentre of geopolitical struggles. Such interference feeds the breeding ground for terrorism—an abomination we unequivocally reject. Whether in Africa or elsewhere, terrorism is unacceptable. No cause can justify the terror, suffering and destruction it engenders.

Today, we reaffirm our commitment to African unity. Especially in West Africa, we bear the historic responsibility of preserving the age-old fraternity that binds our peoples. Benin is ready to play its part in this fight against terrorism and for development. Our unity of action is essential, regardless of the organisations to which we belong.

It is this same commitment to non-violence that led us to condemn the war in Ukraine, the terrorist attacks of 7 October 2023 in the Middle East, and all the violence that daily bereaves our brothers and sisters in the Sahel. We call on the international community to intensify its efforts to restore stability through dialogue, whether in the Middle East—where the two-state solution remains the only viable path—or in Ukraine, the Great Lakes region, Sudan, Libya, or our sister Republic of Haiti.

Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Despite these flashpoints, we must never lose sight of another major challenge threatening the future of our world: poverty in all its forms.

With only five years remaining before the 2030 deadline, it is painfully clear that we will not achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. But we must not give up the fight. The struggle against poverty remains one of the greatest challenges of our time. Without this fight, there can be no true peace, nor lasting stability.

Africa, Ladies and Gentlemen, is the future of the world. In just a few decades, our continent will be home to a quarter of humanity. Our youth, endowed with immense creativity, and our natural resources make Africa an indispensable asset for the planet’s future. But for this potential to become reality, we must eradicate poverty from our continent.

Action is urgent, for each year of delay jeopardises that future. In twenty-five years, when our countries will have mostly reached a century of independence, will we still be debating access to drinking water, electricity, healthcare, and education? Or will we at last have crossed the threshold that allows every African to live in dignity? This is the essential question we must ask ourselves. The time for action has come.

Since 2016, under the leadership of President Patrice Talon, Benin has embarked on the path of progress. We have taken our destiny into our own hands and initiated major reforms in education, health, and infrastructure.

Today, we are committed to a trajectory of transformation and development. The world must recognise these efforts and support the African nations that are working for their future.

Ladies and Gentlemen,  
For Africa to rise, it must also reconcile with its history and its profound identity. Just as it is impossible to understand Europe without the influence of the Christian Church, or the Middle East without reference to Islam, it is equally impossible to grasp the essence of Africa without fully embracing its beliefs, traditions, and civilisation. In this spirit, Benin—birthplace of the Vodun culture—has taken the initiative to correct negative perceptions surrounding this heritage. We seek to reveal to the world the richness of our civilisation. By knowing and respecting our history, beliefs, and culture, the world will understand who we are, and why Africa is essential to global balance and development.

Yet respect for Africa goes beyond the recognition of its past. It must also take shape through a modern pan-Africanism focused on action—a pan-Africanism committed to poverty reduction and the construction of a prosperous continent. This pan-Africanism must be translated into concrete actions. How can we advocate African unity when it is easier for a European to travel within Africa than for an African to do so?

Benin has made a bold decision to eliminate visa requirements for all African nationals. This is not merely a symbolic gesture; it reflects our commitment to building an Africa where every African can feel at home, anywhere on the continent.

Ladies and Gentlemen,  
More than ever, respect for Africa also requires the recognition of its children scattered across the globe. Our brothers and sisters of the diaspora—uprooted by force during the dark hours of the transatlantic slave trade—must regain their place within the African community. It is time to heal these wounds and re-establish the sacred bond with those who, though physically distant, carry Africa in their hearts.

Afro-descendants are not simply distant members of our family. They are our children, our brothers, our sisters. They embody an essential part of our collective identity. By recognising their right to return, we say to them: “You have never ceased to belong to this land. Africa is your home, and we await you with open arms.”

The year 2024 marks the end of the International Decade for People of African Descent. On this occasion, Benin has taken a historic step by passing a law granting Beninese nationality to all Afro-descendants who so wish. This act is more than symbolic: it is an invitation to a shared future, a powerful call to unity and solidarity.

Together, Africans on the continent and in the diaspora, we will meet the challenges of tomorrow. Together, we will build a strong, prosperous and respected Africa.

Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Benin is ready—ready to chart the path towards a united, dynamic, and globally engaged Africa. The African century is within reach. It depends on our ability to seize this opportunity—to build an Africa where every citizen, whether born on the continent or part of the diaspora, plays a key role in our shared renaissance.

Thank you.
