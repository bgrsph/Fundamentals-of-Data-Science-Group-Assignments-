Mr. President,

Your Excellency, the Secretary-General of the United Nations,  
Excellencies, Kings, Presidents, and Heads of Government,  
Ladies and Gentlemen, all those present,

Peace be upon you.

I wish you success amid increasing threats to international peace and security—threats that have tested the credibility of our organisation, undermined the principles of freedom, peace, and justice, and led to violations of international law.


Sudan believes in and supports the role of the United Nations and endorses initiatives aimed at reforming and developing its institutions, upholding human rights, and confronting the challenges of climate change and ethnically or ideologically motivated terrorism.

Distinguished attendees,

Sudan welcomes the theme of this session: **"Unity in Diversity for Peace, Sustainable Development, and Human Dignity"**, and supports the priorities set forth in the vision of the President of the current session. We also stress the importance of implementing the outcomes of the **Summit of the Future**, particularly with regard to reforming the UN and its Security Council to safeguard global peace and foster harmony among nations and peoples.


Distinguished guests,

The growing trend of unilateral actions outside the framework of the United Nations—contrary to the Charter and international law—and the use of political and economic coercion to achieve political aims have significantly contributed to global instability, both politically and economically, and to the outbreak of wars.

Selectivity and double standards have become the prevailing feature in international relations.



Mr. President,

You are surely aware of the magnitude of the challenges and conspiracies facing my country, Sudan, due to a war launched by a group that rebelled against the state—with political and logistical support from both domestic and regional actors.

You have witnessed the atrocities, crimes, and violations committed by this rebellious group against the Sudanese people and the Sudanese state. The war began as an attempted coup to seize power by force of arms, but quickly turned into a full-scale war against the Sudanese people and state, characterised by acts of ethnic cleansing and forced displacement.


The **Rapid Support Forces (RSF)** militia has committed acts of genocide. It deserves to be classified as a terrorist group, as it persistently carries out such crimes. Regrettably, it continues to receive support from regional countries that fund them and supply mercenaries, all in pursuit of political and economic gains—in flagrant defiance of international law and will.

This terrorist group has even targeted diplomatic missions and organisations, looting their property. The United Nations itself was not spared; its premises and assets were violated in disregard of international obligations and with complete impunity. The group rejected the **Jeddah Declaration** and defied Security Council resolutions...


... including the arms embargo on Darfur. They continue their campaign of ethnic cleansing there. Their refusal to comply with the resolution concerning **El Fasher**, the capital of North Darfur State, is a clear indication of this defiance.

Mr. President,

I ask: why has the international community failed to take decisive action against this group and its backers, despite the humanitarian catastrophe, war crimes, and their refusal to implement UN and regional resolutions?

This underscores the urgent need to reform the Security Council, lest double standards become institutionalised within this body.


Ladies and Gentlemen,

This devastating aggression, led by the **RSF militia** and backed by regional countries that provided financial support, weapons, and facilitated the recruitment and movement of mercenaries, has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands and the displacement of millions of Sudanese.

People flee wherever these criminal groups go, seeking safety in areas controlled by the government and the armed forces. Today, millions of Sudanese live in these safe zones.


The **systematic attacks** by this militia worsen the suffering of our citizens daily. From the outset, we sought peaceful solutions. The **Jeddah Declaration of May 2023** could have ended the war and restored normal life. But the political and regional actors fuelling this war chose otherwise.

In an effort to alleviate suffering and facilitate humanitarian aid, we opened our borders and airports, removed obstacles, and eased procedures to allow humanitarian assistance to reach those in need.


Mr. President, distinguished attendees,

The Sudanese Government is firmly committed to facilitating humanitarian efforts, protecting aid convoys and humanitarian and medical personnel. We reaffirm our full commitment to international humanitarian law and civilian protection, which is our responsibility.

Women and children in areas controlled by the militia suffer all manner of violations, including, at times, being sold in markets.

The humanitarian crisis facing a large segment of our people due to the aggression of the **Dagalo militia** demands unified international and organisational efforts to meet declared humanitarian commitments.


We urge the international community and organisations to fulfil their obligations and provide the necessary aid to millions of refugees, displaced persons, and asylum seekers. We have done, and will continue to do, everything possible to ensure aid reaches those in need.

In this regard, we express our gratitude to neighbouring countries that have hosted refugees and to the countries and organisations that have provided aid to the Sudanese people—especially our brothers and sisters in **Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, Eritrea, Kuwait, and South Sudan**.

We particularly thank organisations such as **King Salman Humanitarian Aid Centre, UNICEF, and the World Food Programme**.

Mr. President, esteemed attendees,


We face a great challenge. The United Nations must uphold its responsibilities in protecting developing countries from the ambitions of states that still believe they can control the fate of peoples through power or wealth.

We say to them: **the will of the people is stronger than all of that—and it will prevail.**

Many of today’s crises, including what Sudan is experiencing, stem from the very issues I outlined at the beginning of my speech: **double standards, political coercion, economic blackmail**, and our collective failure—as an organisation tasked with maintaining global peace and security—to deter those who defy international will.


Mr. President,

The commodification of initiatives and the manipulation of peace proposals to serve particular interests or the agendas of certain states has become common, especially in conflict-prone developing countries like Sudan.

From the start of this aggression, we have sought to end the war and spare the country further destruction. We engaged in numerous constructive initiatives and continue to hope for assistance in stopping the war...


...in a manner that safeguards the dignity of our people and the sovereignty of our state, and prevents the recurrence of war.

**Therefore, the roadmap to ending the war in Sudan is clear:**

First, combat operations must cease—this cannot happen unless the **rebel militia withdraws** from the areas it has occupied and depopulated. Its members must be confined to designated areas and **disarmed**, so that citizens may return to their homes, aid can reach them, roads and airports can reopen, and production can resume.


We must establish a **democratic political process** and develop sustainable, nationally-owned solutions to prevent the recurrence of war and military coups.

Mr. President, honoured guests,

I affirm that the **Sudanese Armed Forces**, one of the oldest institutions of the state, operate professionally and independently of any political affiliation. They are wholly committed to democratic transition and to the Sudanese people’s right to choose their leaders.

They are also committed to their first pledge—following the **December 2019 Revolution**—to transfer power to any consensus-based or elected government. They will never allow the return of the former regime, which the people rejected.


We reaffirm our positive role in facilitating the transition to civilian governance. The government renews its commitment to peace with all armed groups and to completing the implementation of the **Juba Peace Agreement** signed in 2020.

Despite the war, the Armed Forces have abided by **international humanitarian law, Geneva Conventions and protocols**, and have made every effort to protect civilians and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance across Sudan.

Mr. President, I affirm that **the Government of Sudan is ready to engage in any initiative to end this war**, so long as it supports national ownership of the solution.


This means ending the rebel militia’s occupation of various areas and restoring the dignity of the people and the **sovereignty of the state** as a first and necessary step toward resuming the democratic path.

It would be **unacceptable** for the Sudanese Government and people to allow **any country or organisation that supported this war**, or took part in the killing and displacement of Sudanese—whether by providing weapons, facilitating their transport, or offering political or other forms of support—to be involved in any future arrangements.

We are determined to **defeat these aggressors**, no matter how much support they receive.

Mr. President, we must thank the states, organisations...


...and human rights or volunteer groups that accurately described the situation in Sudan.

I welcome and endorse the **outcomes of the Manama Summit**, the **Great Lakes Summit in Rwanda**, and the **OIC meeting in Yaoundé**—all of which rightly described the events as an armed rebellion by a militia against the Sudanese state.

Mr. President, we call on this United Nations body to stand firm against such armed groups and prevent future rebellions in other states by classifying such militias—which defy the state and commit acts tantamount to terrorism—as **terrorist entities**. This is your duty.


Mr. President,

We reaffirm our principled position on the **Palestinian cause** and the **right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent state based on the 1967 borders**, and we call for the immediate end of aggression in **Gaza**. We recommend granting **Palestine full membership in the United Nations**.

In conclusion, I renew the thanks of the people and Government of Sudan to all who have stood by us during this ordeal. The need for continued humanitarian assistance and support for the millions in need remains pressing.

Thank you, Mr. President,

And thank you, distinguished attendees.

**The will of the Sudanese people shall prevail.**  
Peace be upon you.
