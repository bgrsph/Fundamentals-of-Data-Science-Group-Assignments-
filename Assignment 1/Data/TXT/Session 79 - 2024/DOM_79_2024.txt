**Mr President,**

On behalf of the Dominican people, I would like to congratulate Mr Philémon Yang on his election as President of this Assembly, and also thank him, along with the Secretary-General, for the successful organisation of this seventy-ninth session, particularly the recently concluded **Summit of the Future**.

This ambitious effort has highlighted the urgent need to strengthen international financing to achieve the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** and demonstrates a sincere will to work for a present and future of peace, citizen well-being, respect for human rights, and democratic values.

I would like to emphasise that in the case of the Dominican Republic, we have made **considerable progress on the SDGs**, including in **poverty reduction, food security, energy sustainability, citizen safety, and climate action**.

To give a few examples:
- **Monetary poverty** fell from 25.8% in 2019 to 23% in 2023, despite the pandemic and the effects of the war, and dropped further to 18.9% in the first half of this year—the **lowest level in our history**.
- Over these four years, we have **more than doubled** spending on **social protection**.
- Our **agricultural policy** has been crucial in ensuring **food security** and maintaining the **profitability of Dominican producers**. Despite being an island with limited arable land, **food self-sufficiency** increased from 88.5% in 2019 to 90.6% in 2023.

Regarding **affordable, clean energy**, we have made significant strides:
- We began building **2,000 megawatts of new thermal generation**, and
- Contracted **1,504 megawatts of renewable energy**.
- By the end of 2027, for the first time ever, we will have an **energy surplus exceeding 15%**, ensuring greater **stability, sustainability, and better pricing** for energy supply.

**Citizen security** has also seen marked improvement:
- The **homicide rate** dropped from **13.2 per 100,000** in 2022 to **11.5 in 2023**, and currently stands at **9.9**—well below the **Latin America and Caribbean average of 17.2**, according to UN data.

We are firmly committed to addressing the **triple planetary crisis**—**climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution**—and have played a leading role in the creation of the **loss and damage fund** and in meeting the **30x30 target** for marine territory protection.

These critical issues deserve all our attention; however, the **resurgence of war and unrestrained violence** compels us to turn our focus to this urgent matter.

Since its adoption in 1945, the **United Nations Charter** has served us well. But over the decades, a number of challenges have accumulated that now **surpass its institutional framework**. There is widespread consensus that we **urgently need a new model of global governance**—one that fosters greater trust and effectiveness in the decisions taken by this indispensable community of nations.

For the Dominican Republic, a firm commitment to **effective and renewed multilateralism** is a top priority. Such an approach is essential to ensure respect for **international law** and to protect nations from the **global threats** that compromise their **security and well-being**. Without concerted and principled action, the foundations of the international community will continue to erode.

Since its founding, the Dominican Republic has championed **peace and the peaceful resolution of conflicts**. The **loss of innocent lives**, particularly children and the elderly, is intolerable. We therefore raise our voice **to demand the effective protection of civilian populations**, as provided for by **international humanitarian law**.

There is a well-supported theory that **democracies rarely go to war with each other**. Dominicans are convinced that **promoting democracy is essential for building lasting peace**.

But democracy must not be reduced to a mere set of mechanical procedures; it must be a **living reality** that positively transforms the lives of citizens.

**Mr President,**

We are at a **critical moment for democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean**. In recent decades, we have witnessed a **worrying decline in the quality and support for democratic systems**.

According to the respected polling organisation **Latinobarómetro**, **support for democracy** has declined significantly between 2010 and 2023, while **support for authoritarianism** has increased during the same period.

Several factors contribute to this decline:
- The **repeated global economic crises**, cyclical since the late 1990s.
- Citizens’ growing **disillusionment** with democracy, driven by a lack of **tangible benefits**, concerns about **personalism**, and widespread **corruption**, which has undermined **trust in democratic institutions**.

This climate has fuelled the **temptation to cling to power**, especially through **indefinite re-election**, which has gained ground over the past 30 years and has **eroded democracy** in our region.

The **Venezuelan crisis** is a case in point, combining **power concentration, persecution of the opposition, and censorship of the media**. Without the **transparency required of any electoral process**, and without proper documentation, the crisis will only worsen.

We will continue to insist on:
- The **publication of all electoral records**,
- Their **verification by impartial institutions**, and
- **Respect for the will of the Venezuelan people**.

Without this transparency, **no winner can be legitimately declared**.

**Mr President,**

**Alternation in power** is a fundamental principle for ensuring **responsible and genuinely participatory politics**.  
Democracy is founded on a basic tenet: **the loser must accept defeat and become a loyal and constructive opposition**.  
Equally, the winner must not **dominate or crush** the opponent.  

**Democracy cannot be exercised solely by and for the winners.**  
The majority must ensure **respect and inclusion** of minorities, who enjoy **equal rights** and must be treated with **fairness and justice**.

On **19 May**, the Dominican people re-elected me in the **first round** for a **second and final presidential term**, also granting us a **qualified majority in both chambers** of Congress.

With the goal of **strengthening Dominican democracy**, I recently submitted a **constitutional reform** to Congress, aimed at **definitively limiting presidential re-election**: **two consecutive terms, and never more**.

This reform seeks to leave behind a legacy of **greater political and social stability** for future generations, and to firmly establish a guiding principle:  
**Power is always temporary and must serve the people.**

**Mr President,**

All democracies demand a commitment to **human rights**, which are essential to protect the **dignity and freedom** of every person and to grant **legitimacy to political power**.

The Dominican Government is deeply committed to the protection of **human rights** at both national and international levels.  
This commitment is an **integral part** of our foreign policy, which holds the **promotion and defence of human rights** as a **core pillar**.

Here, there are no calculations, no sides—only **principles**.

That is why the **crisis in Haiti** deserves special attention.  
For over **three years**, instability in our neighbouring country has placed **significant pressure on our national security**.  
We have consistently called for **stronger international engagement** in stabilising Haiti.  
This is a **strategic necessity** for the security of my country and of the entire region.

The Dominican State has shouldered **immense responsibilities** in the Haitian crisis—well beyond what is expected—by providing **essential services** to a large population from the neighbouring country.

- In **2023**, **Haitian immigrants accounted for 9.9%** of all services delivered by our healthcare system.
- From **2019 to March 2024**, **Haitian nationals** made up a **significant portion** of public hospital patients.
- Currently, there are **around 200,000 foreign minors** in our public education system, **of whom approximately 147,906 are of Haitian origin**.

These figures reflect the **solidarity** of the Dominican Republic.  
But we **cannot do it alone**.

After years of advocacy and the passing of multiple Security Council resolutions, we finally see a **path toward stability**, with the creation of Haiti’s **Presidential Transitional Council** and the deployment of the **Multinational Security Support (MSS) Mission**.

We thank:
- **Kenya and President Ruto**, for contributing the majority of deployed personnel;
- The **United States**, for its **financial and logistical leadership**;
- **Jamaica, The Bahamas, and El Salvador**, for their troop contributions;
- And **CARICOM**, for its efforts to foster dialogue and consensus in Haiti.

The Dominican Republic has also contributed by **facilitating emergency healthcare services** for the MSS.

However, only **400 MSS personnel** have been deployed so far—**far below the 1,000 required** for effectiveness.  
Worse still, the **trust fund for Haiti** remains **underfunded**, preventing full deployment and the attainment of its objectives: **restoring order and supporting the eventual holding of free, fair, and transparent elections**.

**Ladies and Gentlemen,**  
We have come this far at great sacrifice.  
But with elections in Haiti **less than a year away**, the necessary conditions are **still not in place**.  
We **must not allow** the progress made to collapse, or else **Haiti’s total collapse will be imminent**, with consequences for **the entire region**.

It is **unacceptable** that those countries most involved in Haiti’s crisis—or committed to resolving it—have **not yet fulfilled their promises**.

As long as my country’s **national security is at stake**, I will continue to **demand stability and development in Haiti**.

---

**Mr President,**

The Dominican Republic and the government I lead will continue to work with the international community **in solidarity and good faith** to meet the **Sustainable Development Goals**.

The global landscape demands that we act as a **cohesive community**, as a **true concert of nations**, united by a **common purpose** and a **shared vision for the future**.

**History will judge us**—not only by the words we deliver in this esteemed chamber, but more importantly, **by the actions we take**.

We **cannot fail our peoples**.  
We **cannot fail humanity**.  
We **cannot fail the future**.

**Thank you very much.**
